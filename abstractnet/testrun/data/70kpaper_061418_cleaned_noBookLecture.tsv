5834868425ff05a97b00c145	Abstract—This paper presents a study of a classical mech-anism synthesis problem in the framework of multi-objective optimisation. In addition to the primary kinematic objective of reducing the structural error, staying away from the singular configurations is considered as a secondary objective. Two wellstudied coupler-curve synthesis problems reported in existing literature are revisited for the purpose of application of the proposed formulations, and the results are obtained using the genetic algorithm-based optimiser, NSGA-II.
5834868425ff05a97b00c15b	In automated theorem proving, the nondeterminism of proof rule application naturally gives rise to nested and/or branching of independent subgoals. This problem structure should be amenable to parallel exploration, but there are at present few theorem prover implementations which actually exploit this potential. We propose a new programming model to make it easier to write such parallel provers. In it, details such as communication and work distribution among processors are hidden from the programmer.
5834868425ff05a97b00c167	Our notion of step in the operational semantics is de ned abstractly and does not coincide with the actual operations performed in an implementation of ML. Since we will be mainly concerned with proving correctness, but not complexity of implementation, the number of steps is largely irrelevant and we will write e=) e0 for reduction. Evaluation and reduction are related in the sense that if e,! v then e 1=) e1 1=) 1=) v and vice versa.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1d2	Descriptive Types. In logic programming terminology, a type system is called descriptive if it captures some aspect of program behavior, where program behavior is defined entirely without reference to types. A common example is to think of a type as an approximation to the success set of the program, that is, the set of terms on which it holds. Reconsider addition on unary numbers: plus (z, N, N). plus (s (M), N, s (P)):-plus (M, N, P).
5834868425ff05a97b00c1b3	The design of linear logic programming languages and theorem provers opens a number of new implementation challenges not present in more traditional logic languages such as Horn clauses (Prolog) and hereditary Harrop formulas (λProlog and Elf). Among these, the problem of efficiently managing the linear context when solving a goal is of crucial importance for the use of these systems in non-trivial applications. This paper studies this problem in the case of Lolli [HM94], though its results have application to other systems.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2a5	Propositional dynamic logic (PD) L is a multi-modal logic with structured modalities. For each program α, there is a box-modality [α] and a diamond modality〈 α〉. PDL was developed from first-order dynamic logic by Fischer-Ladner [FL79] and has become popular recently [GW09]. Here we consider regular PDL.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8f5	Piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, and shape memory alloy actuators are gaining importance in high-frequency precision applications constrained by space. Their intrinsic hysteretic behavior makes control difficult. The Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator can model hysteresis well, albeit a major inadequacy: the inverse operator does not exist when the hysteretic curve gradient is not positive definite, ie, ill condition occurs when slope is negative. An inevitable tradeoff between modeling accuracy and inversion stability exists.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2c8	While it is indubitably impossible to summarize all the many important aspects of Ernst-Rüdiger Olderog's scientific contributions and to do justice to each and every one of the areas that he contributed to, it is remarkably easy to identify and characterize the common core behind his investigations. An important leitmotif in his research agenda is semantics, the study of meaning.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2cc	We propose a constructive approach to the resource semantics of substructural logics via proof-preserving translations into a fragment of focused first-order intuitionistic logic with a preorder. Using these translations, we can obtain uniform proofs of cut admissibility, identity expansion, and the completeness of focusing for a variety of logics. We illustrate our approach on linear, ordered, and bunched logics.
5834868425ff05a97b00c220	Generally speaking, it is difficult to add concurrency to a language and retain the same kind of strong guarantees that static typing in a language like C0 gives us. For a sequential language, type safety usually includes preservation (that program remains well-typed as it executes) and progress (there is always a well-defined action to take). In the presence of concurrency, we would like to add deadlockfreedom (which is an analogue to progress) and the absence of race conditions (to guarantee the result is well-defined).
5834868425ff05a97b00c316	CLF (the Concurrent Logical Framework) is a language for specifying and reasoning about concurrent systems. Its most significant feature is the first-class representation of concurrent executions as monadic expressions. We illustrate the representation techniques available within CLF by applying them to an asynchronous pi-calculus with correspondence assertions, including its dynamic semantics, safety criterion, and a type system with latent effects due to Gordon and Jeffrey.
5834868425ff05a97b00c334	This paper formalises the concept of safe working zone (SWZ) of a parallel manipulator, which is a subspace of the workspace that is free of singularities as well as issues of joint limits and link interference. It presents further a generic scheme to identify such a space, and specialises the same for the case of a convex SWZ around a chosen point of interest. The theoretical developments are illustrated via an application on a three-degree-of-freedom spatial parallel manipulator, namely, MaPaMan-I.

5834868425ff05a97b00c481	Hybrid systems have a complete axiomatization in differential dynamic logic relative to continuous systems. They also have a complete axiomatization relative to discrete systems. Moreover, there is a constructive reduction of properties of hybrid systems to corresponding properties of continuous systems or to corresponding properties of discrete systems. We briefly summarize and discuss some of the implications of these results.
5834868425ff05a97b00caf4	A recent trend (especially in electronic commerce) is higher levels of expressiveness in the mechanisms that mediate interactions such as auctions, exchanges, catalog offers, voting systems, matching of peers, and so on. Participants can express their preferences in drastically greater detail than ever before. In many cases this trend is fueled by modern algorithms for winner determination that can handle the richer inputs.
5834868425ff05a97b00def7	Despite the remarkable success of open source software, there are a number of challenges to collaboration in open source software development, in particular, with respect to supporting collaboration among developers, supporting potential contributors, and in bringing users and developers together. In this paper, we examine some of the possible enhancements of open source development environments, and consider the application of Semantic Web technology to address these.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4ed	In automated theorem proving different kinds of proof systems have been used. Traditional proof systems, such as Hilbert-style proofs or natural deduction we call non-analytic, while resolution or mating proof systems we call analytic. There are many good reasons to study the connections between analytic and non-analytic proofs. We would like a theorem prover to make efficient use of both analytic and non-analytic methods to get the best of both worlds.
5834868425ff05a97b00defb	A-Match is a matchmaking system that allows agents to enter and exit the system dynamically. It employs a Matchmaker to support agents in the system in their exchange of services. A-Match lets human users interact with the Matchmaker. Through the A-Match users find agents that can provide needed services or advertise new agents. The functionality of the A-Match is displayed in the context of the Warren System, a system that supports the user to manage its own stock portfolio.
5834868425ff05a97b00df07	This paper presents an applicable model for complex multi-attribute negotiations between autonomous agents. The model adopts a novel protocol which decomposes the original n-dimensional negotiation space into a series of negotiation base lines and in each period agents negotiate locally based on a given base line. A belief based negotiation strategy and an offer enhancement process are proposed for agents to make base offer on the negotiation base line and search for Pareto optimal enhancements of the base offer.
5834868425ff05a97b00c507	We give a detailed, informal proof of the Church-Rosser property for the untyped A-calculus and show its representation in LF. The proof is due to Tait and Martin-L6f and is based on the notion of parallel reduction. The representation employs higher-order abstract syntax and the judgments-as-types principle and takes advantage of term reconstruction as it is provided in the Elf implementation of LF. Proofs of meta-theorems are represented as higher-level judgments which relate sequences of reductions and conversions.
5834868425ff05a97b00c537	The intuitionistic modal logic of necessity is based on the judgmental notion of categorical truth. In this article we investigate the consequences of relativizing these concepts to explicitly specified contexts. We obtain contextual modal logic and its type-theoretic analogue. Contextual modal type theory provides an elegant, uniform foundation for understanding metavariables and explicit substitutions. We sketch some applications in functional programming and logical frameworks.
5834868425ff05a97b00df33	We discuss how agents can support collaborative planning activities within coalitions, where coalition partners plan and act according to given policies. In a set of experiments with human test subjects, we investigate how agents can aid such a collaborative planning effort and how effective they are in the chosen support modes. 1.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbb2	In a list entitled “Epigrams on Programming” published a few years ago, the late and well known computer pioneer Alan J. Perlis said (Epigram 65): Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers—not symbols. We measure our understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

5834868425ff05a97b00d5df	A recent trend towards greater automation of earthmoving machines, such as backhoes, loaders, and dozers, reflects a larger movement in the construction industry to improve productivity, efficiency, and safety. This paper reviews related work in various disciplines drawn upon by researchers—soil mechanics, computer graphics, kinematic and dynamical modeling, optimization, control, and decision theory. A taxonomy is suggested into which various automated systems reported in the literature, can be classified.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5e0	A system (400) for positioning and navigating an autonomous vehicle (310) allows the vehicle (310) to travel between locations. Position information (432) is derived from global positioning system satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) or other sources (624) when the satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) are not in the view of the vehicle (310). Navigation of the vehicle (310) is obtained using the position information (432), route information (414), obstacle detection and avoidance data (416), and on board vehicle data (908 and 910).
5834868425ff05a97b00d8e7	In this paper, we prove a number of properties of the Delayed D* algorithm introduced in [1], including its termination and correctness. In what follows, we deal with the fixed initial state version of Delayed D*(shown in Figures 1 and 2), but these results can easily be extended, following similar lines as in [2], to the navigation version.
5834868425ff05a97b00d915	Energy management is a critical problem in designing mobile computing systems, especially when those systems depend on harvesting energy from environmental sources, such as solar or wind. Environmental sources are highly variable and difficult to predict, which is often complicated further by device mobility. In this demo, we present a simple approach for developing energy-aware applications using...
5834868425ff05a97b00d9b8	We present a framework for efficient extrapolation of reduced rank approximations, graph kernels, and locally linear embeddings (LLE) to unseen data. We also present a principled method to combine many of these kernels and then extrapolate them. Central to our method is a theorem for matrix approximation, and an extension of the representer theorem to handle multiple joint regularization constraints. Experiments in protein classification demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc36	For many navigation tasks, a single sensing modality is sufficiently rich to accomplish the desired motion control goals; for practical autonomous outdoor navigation, a single sensing modality is a crippling limitation on what tasks can be undertaken. Using a neural network paradigm particularly well suited to sensor fusion the authors have successfully performed simulated and real-world navigation tasks that required the use of multiple sensing modalities.
5834868425ff05a97b00ce2b	Since 1989, the author has tried to show that it is possible to put a complete semester-long course in machine-held form. Several examples have been carried out (in Mathematica), and the paper reports on the experience, on the problems encountered, and on some suggestions for future developments.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc4e	This paper reports details of a versatile implementation of the TraderBots approach: A market-based approach to multirobot coordination.

Different features and strengths of the approach and the implementation are highlighted in the experimental results.
5834868525ff05a97b00ecb4	Access control is extremely important within a hierarchy in which users and their information are divided into several security grades.

5834868425ff05a97b00c1c4	Re nement types allow many more properties of programs to be expressed and statically checked than conventional type systems. We present a practical algorithm for re nement-type checking for an ML-like language which reduces the problem to checking Quanti ed Boolean Formulae.
5834868425ff05a97b00c821	While the effectiveness of one-on-one human tutoring has been well established, a great deal of controversy surrounds the issue of which features of tutorial dialogue separate effective uses of dialogue in tutoring from those that are less effective. In this paper we present a formal comparison of Socratic versus Didactic style tutoring that argues in favor of the Socratic tutoring style.
5834868425ff05a97b00e17e	Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems with hidden state present significant obstacles to prevailing RL methods. In this paper, we present experiments conducted using a straightforward approach to solving such problems that trains artificial neural networks with recurrent connections to represent action policies using evolutionary search.

With the Nomad system, mobile agents travel to the eAuctionHouse site and participate in auctions on the user's behalf. Users can create agents using Java or can automatically generate agents from Nomad's template agent library.
5834868425ff05a97b00d09e	One embodiment is a method to manage queries in a database. The method identifies a query that executes on the database for an elapsed time that is greater than a threshold and then implements a remedial action when the query executes on the database for an execution time that is greater than an estimated execution time.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0a3	This paper proposes architectural refinements, server-driven metadata prefetching, and namespace flattening for improving the efficiency of small file workloads in object-based storage systems. Server-driven metadata prefetching consists of having the metadata server provide information and capabilities for multiple objects, rather than just one, in response to each lookup. Doing so allows clients to access the contents of many small files for each metadata server interaction, reducing access latency and metadata server load.
5834868425ff05a97b00c195	Concurrent traces are sequences of computational steps where independent steps can be permuted and executed in any order. We study the problem of matching on concurrent traces. We give a sound and complete algorithm for matching traces with one variable standing for an unknown subtrace.
5834868425ff05a97b00e28a	Purpose: To describe the prevalence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and its risk factors in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Methods: This population-based study of 10,033 participants (75.7% response rate) included Chinese, Indian and Malay persons aged 40 years and older. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination, standardized interviews and laboratory blood tests were performed. Digital fundus photographs were assessed for presence of RVO following the definitions used in the Blue Mountains Eye Study.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8c6	An instrument for intraoperative sensing of surgeons' hand tremor during vitreoretinal microsurgery has been developed. The instrument uses inertial sensing to detect tremor in six degrees of freedom. Instrument tip velocity is computed using the sensor data. The displacement amplitude of the tremor is then approximated analytically by modeling the velocity as sinusoidal. The instrument presently estimates oscillations at physiological tremor frequencies with error of less than 7%.
5834868425ff05a97b00d781	This article presents concepts and issues related to creating the Universal Digital Library containing all the creative works of the human race. Such a system raises a number of technical, economic and legal issues which need to be solved before the vision can be realized. This article further presents the current status and future directions in digital libraries.
5834868425ff05a97b00c838	Systems and methods are provided for an electro-mechanical system. A system includes a plurality of connected modules. A first module of the modules includes an actuator for imparting motion on the electro-mechanical system and a data processor configured to sense a state of the first module and to command the actuator to modify the state of the first module.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1af	Our notion of step in the operational semantics is defined abstractly and does not coincide with the actual operations performed in an implementation of ML. Since we will be mainly concerned with proving correctness, but not complexity of implementation, the number of steps is largely irrelevant and we will write e=⇒ e/for reduction. Evaluation and reduction are related in the sense that if e↩→ v then e 1=⇒ e1 1=⇒··· 1=⇒ v and vice versa.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8f6	In robotics research, perception is one of the most challenging tasks. In contrast to existing approaches that rely only on computer vision, we propose an alternative method for improving perception by learning from human teammates. To evaluate, we apply this idea to a door detection problem. A set of preliminary experiments has been completed using software agents with real vision data. Our results demonstrate that information inferred from teammate observations significantly improves the perception precision.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc55	Executive Summary The Urban Challenge represents a technological leap beyond the previous Grand Challenges. The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1fb	In C0, values of type int are defined to have 32 bits. In this problem we work with a version of C0 called C8 where values of type int are defined to have only 8 bits. In other respects it is the same as C0. All integer operations are still in two's complement arithmetic, but now modulo 28. All bitwise operations are still bitwise, except on only 8 bit words instead of 32 bit words.
5834868425ff05a97b00c95f	In the following analysis, we use DELTACON for measuring connectivity differences between two graphs. In [2], we show that DELTACON is:(a) principled, conforming to all the axioms and properties introduced in the paper,(b) intuitive, giving similarity scores that agree with common sense and can be easily explained, and (c) scalable, able to handle large-scale graphs. We also introduce DELTACON-ATTR for change attribution between graphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00c245	We present an approach to enriching ML's type system with a form of dependent types, where index objects are restricted to some constraint domains C, leading to the DML (C) language schema. Pure inference for the resulting system is no longer possible, but we show that typechecking a sufficiently annotated program can be reduced to constraint satisfaction. We exhibit the unobtrusiveness of our approach through practical examples (including static array bounds checking) and prove that DML (C) is conservative over ML.
5834868425ff05a97b00c269	Robot Obstacle Avoidance [2]: Nowadays, robots interact frequently with a dynamic environment outside limited manufacturing sites and in close proximity with humans. Thus, safety of motion and obstacle avoidance are vital safety features of such robots. We formally verify that our controller avoids both stationary and moving obstacles.
5834868425ff05a97b00c37c	In this project we will implement and use space-time behavior based correlation algorithm to recognize the human activity and pose. Space-time correlation method measures the similarity between two distinct video clips based on the motion. We will use this algorithm in a nearest neighbor type classifier to find the best match to a new query in the database and then recognize the human activity based on prior known labels of the database.
5834868425ff05a97b00de2d	Abstract—This talk will provide an overview of approaches to grasping, autonomous navigation and cooperative mapping by aerial robots with an emphasis on micro UAVs. It will also discuss the scientific and technological challenges and outline directions for future research in these fields.
5834868425ff05a97b00c3e3	We describe some genome assembly problems as a general problem of covering a hypergraph by linear and circular walks, where vertices represent sequence elements, repeated sequences are modelled by assigning a multiplicity to vertices, and edges represent co-localization information. We show that deciding if a given assembly hypergraph admits an assembly is fixed-parameter tractable, and we provide two exact polynomial time algorithms for clearing ambiguities caused by repeats.
5834868425ff05a97b00c3f4	The behavior and structure of a shared-memory parallel program can be characterized by a task graph that encodes the instructions, memory accesses, and dependencies of each piece of parallel work. Task graphs are not specific to one threading library or target architecture. The Contech analysis framework provides the means for generating and analyzing task graphs that enable computer architects and programmers to gain a deeper understanding of parallel programs.
5834868425ff05a97b00c401	The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem asserts the impossibility of designing a non-dictatorial voting rule in which truth-telling always constitutes a Nash equilibrium. We show that in voting games of complete information where a mediator is on hand, this troubling impossibility result can be alleviated. Indeed, we characterize families of voting rules where, given a mediator, truthful preference revelation is always in strong equilibrium. In particular, we observe that the family of feasible elimination procedures has the foregoing property.
5834868425ff05a97b00c406	We present the first model of optimal voting under adversarial noise. From this viewpoint, voting rules are seen as error-correcting codes: their goal is to correct errors in the input rankings and recover a ranking that is close to the ground truth. We derive worst-case bounds on the relation between the average accuracy of the input votes, and the accuracy of the output ranking. Empirical results from real data show that our approach produces significantly more accurate rankings than alternative approaches.

5834868425ff05a97b00de81	We derive the correspondence between regularization operators used in Regularization Networks and Hilbert Schmidt Kernels appearing in Support Vector Machines. More specifica1ly, we prove that the Green's Functions associated with regularization operators are suitable Support Vector Kernels with equivalent regularization properties. As a by-product we show that a large number of Radial Basis Functions namely conditionally positive definite functions may be used as Support Vector kernels.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca36	This journal is devoted entirely to research in pure and applied mathematics and is devoted principally to the publication of original papers of moderate length. A department called Shorter Notes was established for the purpose of publishing very short papers of an unusually elegant and polished character, for which there is normally no other outlet.
5834868425ff05a97b00de83	Consider the following problem: given sets of unlabeled observations, each set with known label proportions, predict the labels of another set of observations, possibly with known label proportions. This problem occurs in areas like e-commerce, politics, spam filtering and improper content detection. We present consistent estimators which can reconstruct the correct labels with high probability in a uniform convergence sense. Experiments show that our method works well in practice.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca38	An example is given of a partial recursive functional on a subfamily of 3R which cannot be extended to a partial recursive functional on S3. We now state the main result of the paper. The following three conditions on a functional< 1> are equivalent:(1)< D is an effective operation on 3K,(2)< b isapartial recursive functional onW,(3)< b is a functional on 2K which can be extended to a partial recursive functional on S3.
5834868425ff05a97b00de84	In this paper we unify divergence minimization and statistical inference by means of convex duality. In the process of doing so, we prove that the dual of approximate maximum entropy estimation is maximum a posteriori estimation as a special case. Moreover, our treatment leads to stability and convergence bounds for many statistical learning problems. Finally, we show how an algorithm by Zhang can be used to solve this class of optimization problems efficiently.
5834868425ff05a97b00de87	Kernel-based learning methods provide their solutions as expansions in terms of a kernel. We consider the problem of reducing the computational complexity of evaluating these expansions by approximating them using fewer terms. As a by-product, we point out a connection between clustering and approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces generated by a particular class of kernels.
5834868425ff05a97b00deb3	We present a simple sparse greedy technique to approximate the maximum a posteriori estimate of Gaussian Processes with much improved scaling behaviour in the sample size m. In particular, computational requirements are O (n2 m), storage is O (nm), the cost for prediction is 0 (n) and the cost to compute confidence bounds is O (nm), where n «: m. We show how to compute a stopping criterion, give bounds on the approximation error, and show applications to large scale problems.
5834868425ff05a97b00deb6	We describe a technique for comparing distributions without the need for density estimation as an intermediate step. Our approach relies on mapping the distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Applications of this technique can be found in two-sample tests, which are used for determining whether two sets of observations arise from the same distribution, covariate shift correction, local learning, measures of independence, and density estimation.
5834868425ff05a97b00deba	Much recent attention, both experimental and theoretical, has been focussed on classification algorithms which produce voted combinations of classifiers. Recent theoretical work has shown that the impressive generalization performance of algorithms like AdaBoost can be attributed to the classifier having large margins on the training data. We present abstract algorithms for finding linear and convex combinations of functions that minimize arbitrary cost functionals (ie functionals that do not necessarily depend on the margin).
5834868425ff05a97b00debb	This paper addresses the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation with a support vector machine, hence further automating machine learning. This goal is achieved by defining a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the space of kernels itself. Such a formulation leads to a statistical estimation problem similar to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional.
5834868425ff05a97b00c32e	Of late, researchers appear to be intrigued with the question; Given a set of points, what is the region occupied by them? The answer appears to be neither straight forward nor unique. Convex hull, which gives a convex enclosure of the given set, concave hull, which generates non-convex polygons and other variants such as α-hull, poly hull, r-shape and s-shape etc. have been proposed. In this paper, we extend the question of finding a minimum area enclosure (MAE) to a set of closed planar freeform curves, not resorting to sampling them.
5834868425ff05a97b00cadb	Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a leading algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium in large zero-sum imperfect-information games. CFR is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly traverses the game tree, updating regrets at each information set. We introduce an improvement to CFR that prunes any path of play in the tree, and its descendants, that has negative regret. It revisits that sequence at the earliest subsequent CFR iteration where the regret could have become positive, had that path been explored on every iteration.
5834868425ff05a97b00def6	The Web is moving from being a collection of pages toward a collection of services that interoperate through the Internet. In this paper we show how ontological information improves on the growing Web services infrastructure by adding capability matching and a high degree of autonomy to web services so that they can automatically adapt to changing situations.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4e8	We describe a module system for Elf, a logic programming language based on the LF logical framework. The static part of the module calculus addresses name-space management and structured presentation of deductive systems. The dynamic part addresses search-space management and modularization of logic programs.
5834868425ff05a97b00def9	Wide area search munitions (WASMs) are a cross between an unmanned aerial vehicle and a munition. With an impressive array of onboard sensors and autonomous flight capabilities WASMs might play a variety of roles on the modern battle field including reconnaissance, search, battle damage assessment, or communications relay.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4f0	We present an authorization logic that permits reasoning with explicit time. Following a proof-theoretic approach, we study the meta-theory of the logic, including cut elimination. We also demonstrate formal connections to proof-carrying authorization's existing approach for handling time and comment on the enforceability of our logic in the same framework. Finally, we illustrate the expressiveness of the logic through examples, including those with complex interactions between time, authorization, and mutable state.
5834868425ff05a97b00c505	We prove that partial type reconstruction for the pure polymorphic λ-calculus is undecidable by a reduction from the second-order unification problem, extending a previous result by H.-J. Boehm. We show further that partial type reconstruction remains undecidable even in a very small predicative fragment of the polymorphic λ-calculus, which implies undecidability of partial type reconstruction for λML as introduced by Harper, Mitchell, and Moggi.
5834868425ff05a97b00c515	We consider how mode (such as input and output) and termination properties of typed higher-order constraint logic programming languages may be declared and checked effectively. The systems that we present have been validated through an implementation and numerous case studies.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb7d	Network functions virtualization (NFV) is an appealing vision that promises to dramatically reduce capital and operating expenses for cellular providers. However, existing efforts in this space leave open broad issues about how NFV deployments should be instantiated or how they should be provisioned. In this paper, we present an initial attempt at a framework that will help network operators systematically evaluate the potential benefits that different points in the NFV design space can offer.
5834868425ff05a97b00c3e7	Commonsense Knowledge (lexical+ common knowledge) and Encyclopedic knowledge helps in different situations because one is about entities and other is about named entities. We set up a principled experiment to empirically verify that for real world scenarios, it is best to have a marriage of the types of knowledge. We envision WordNet to be the mediator between these two systems just like Wikipedia is the mediator in linked open data. For this purpose the Yago ontology would be helpful as well.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4df	“An architecture can be defined as the structure of components, their relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time. In simple terms, an architecture is an in-depth blueprint for constructing and integrating all aspects of a software-intensive system.” 7 It also has been described as a strategic design of how a solution is implemented (eg, component based engineering standards, security) and a functional design of what a solution does (eg, algorithms, design patterns, low level implementation).
5834868425ff05a97b00cb79	We wish to estimate the mean of heavy-tailed high-dimensional random variables. The sample average, x, while an unbiased estimate of the mean, is itself heavy-tailed so it is not likely to be near the mean. We investigate instead computing the sample average of small batches of the data, then returning that average whose distance to the other averages is smallest. Algorithm1 describes the method formally.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7ff	We are grateful to all of the discussants for their thoughtful comments. Their remarks have added significant insight and perspective on the work.

5834868425ff05a97b00c57c	Automatic question generation can support instruction and learning. However, work to date has produced mostly “shallow” questions that fall short of supporting deep learning and discussion. We propose an extension to a state-of-the-art question generation system that allows it to produce deep, subjective questions suitable for group discussion. We evaluate the questions generated by this system against a panel of experienced judges, and find that our approach fares significantly better than the baseline system.
5834868425ff05a97b00c58e	This paper describes key issues underlying the design of a tutoring system that brainstorms with students in order to support qualitative problem solving. Cognitively oriented and socially oriented support are enabled by two technologies, namely heuristic-based feedback generation and community-data-driven social recommendation. Formal representations and corresponding automated reasoning procedures for these technologies are introduced.

The seedling growth indexes including plant height and crown width, biomass allocation, camptothecin (CPT) content and CPT yield of different organs (young leaf, old leaf, stem, and root) were studied. For the 5 selected planting densities, the plant biomass, height, crown width, and total leaf area ofC.

5834868525ff05a97b00e924	In this paper, we propose a semi-analytic algorithm for measuring the mean and variance of the cost associated with a two-sided move-based hedging of options written on an underlying asset whose price follows a geometric Brownian motion. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the computational accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. We then apply the technique to a structured product-based variable annuity with buffered protection and an annual ratchet variable annuity.

The time for such velvet-glove approaches is long past. This is a war, and it is time to use all the resources at our disposal. We propose a method and apparatus to save the world from itself.
5834868425ff05a97b00cc92	The years since the advent of multiprocessing have witnessed the proliferation of journal articles, conferences, and symposia on multiprocessing systems and closely related topics. The body of literature so generated is both vast and scattered–a situation that can be quite disheartening to one unfamiliar with this area of computer science.
5834868425ff05a97b00ccac	We put forth the view that trace modulation is an indispensable technique for building and evaluating mobile computing systems. The essence of our solution is transparent, real-time, trace-driven emulation of a target network. Although conceptually simple, trace modulation strikes an attractive balance between the conflicting demands of realism, ease-of-use, and reproducibility. It provides three important benefits. First, it allows control of the complexity of the network environment to which mobile software is exposed.

5834868425ff05a97b00d896	Graphical models are an effective tool for analyzing structured and relational data. In particular, they allow us to arrive at insights that are implicit, ie latent in the data. Dealing with such data on the internet poses a range of challenges. Firstly, the sheer size renders many well-known inference algorithms infeasible. Secondly, the problems arising on the internet do not always fit well into the known categories for latent variable inference such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or clustering. In this tutorial we address a number of aspects.

5834868425ff05a97b00c1a2	We derive a family of algorithms around the theme of higher-order uniﬁcation. The main derivation starts with a concise, abstract speciﬁcation and ends with a version of Huet's algorithm for higher-order uniﬁcation. Next we derive some very useful high-level optimizations. Finally. we describe how to extend the algorithm to give a complete treatment of products and an incomplete but very useful treatment of polymorphism, yielding a new and signiﬁcantly more powerful algorithm (which we have implemented).
5834868425ff05a97b00d0c8	We present a novel approach for learning nonlinear dynamic models, which leads to a new set of tools capable of solving problems that are otherwise difficult. We provide theory showing this new approach is consistent for models with long range structure, and apply the approach to motion capture and high-dimensional video data, yielding results superior to standard alternatives.
5834868425ff05a97b00e33a	Today's service-oriented systems realize many ideas from the research conducted a decade or so ago in multiagent systems. Because these two fields are so deeply connected, further advances in multiagent systems could feed into tomorrow's successful service-oriented computing approaches. This article describes a 15-year roadmap for service-oriented multiagent system research.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2a6	Beware that the consistency of S does not imply that D− S is consistent. For the trivial Kripke structure with empty accessibility relation and only one world s, S:={A: K, s|= A} is maximally K-consistent. Especially DA, D¬ A∈ S for any formula A. But that means that D− S is inconsistent.

5834868425ff05a97b00df5c	Abstract—In order to achieve a mission, human planners create plans, which divide the mission into tasks. In order to fulfill their goals, tasks require critical resources including sensor assets. Precise determination and timely allocation of these resources may be crucial to achieve the overall mission. Unfortunately, determining the resources necessary to achieve a task during planning involves many challenges. For example, the environment and conditions during the plan execution may not be correctly estimated during planning.
5834868425ff05a97b00c528	Following the general method and related completeness results on using explicit substitutions to perform higher-order unification proposed in [5], we investigate in this paper the case of higher-order patterns as introduced by Miller. We show that our general algorithm specializes in a very convenient way to patterns. We also sketch an efficient implementation of the abstract algorithm and its generalization to constraint simplification.
5834868425ff05a97b00c488	Designing and analyzing hybrid systems, which are models for complex physical systems, is expensive and error-prone. The dissertation presented in this article introduces a verification logic that is suitable for analyzing the behavior of hybrid systems. It presents a proof calculus and a new deductive verification tool for hybrid systems that has been used successfully to verify aircraft and train control.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6e9	Mapping human genetic variation is fundamentally interesting in fields such as anthropology and forensic inference. At the same time, patterns of genetic diversity confound efforts to determine the genetic basis of complex disease. Due to technological advances, it is now possible to measure hundreds of thousands of genetic variants per individual across the genome. Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely used to summarize the genetic similarity between subjects. The eigenvectors are interpreted as dimensions of ancestry.

5834868425ff05a97b00c6f7	We identify frequency limitations on linearity in two-dimensional (2-D) motion for three subject groups: young (mean and/spl sigma/: 23/spl plusmn/3), old (72/spl plusmn/2), and movement-disabled (65/spl plusmn/16). The linearity of the relationship between input and output-ie, between target tracking signals and resulting human upper extremity motion-is quantified using adaptive coherence estimation. We show that linearity decreases with input frequency. Old and disabled subjects'2-D motion is almost completely nonlinear.
5834868425ff05a97b00c713	Prior work has highlighted the challenges faced by people with athetosis when trying to acquire on-screen targets using a mouse or trackball. The difficulty of positioning the mouse cursor within a confined area has been identified as a challenging task. We have developed a target acquisition assistance algorithm that features transition assistance via directional gain variation based on target prediction, settling assistance via gain reduction in the vicinity of a predicted target, and expansion of the predicted target as the cursor approaches it.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbca	We classify all sub-cartesian closed categories of the category of separable Scott domains. The classification employs a notion of coherence degree determined by the possible inconsistency patterns of sets of finite elements of a domain. Using the classification, we determine all sub-cartesian closed categories of the category of separable Scott domains that contain a universal object. The separable Scott domain models of the λβ-calculus are then classified up to a retraction by their coherence degrees.

5834868425ff05a97b00c93d	Abstract—The uncertainty of the wireless channel in realistic wireless networks inhibits the effectiveness of the of the higher level protocols and models to predict the effect of channel. Measurement based models and protocols overcome this hurdle by measuring the essential lower level parameters and use these empirical data as an input for decision making at the higher layers. Received signal strength and error rates are two such measured parameters that are extensively used for capturing the effect of randomness in the wireless channel.
5834868425ff05a97b00c71d	HeartLander is a small, mobile robot designed to assist with surgical procedures on the surface of the heart. It crawls within the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. The friction forces HeartLander experiences from the pericardium and the heartbeat reduce locomotion efficiency. We have developed an algorithm that creates a plan for reaching a set of treatment targets, while minimizing the time spent in locomotion. Results from simulation show improvement over a simple greedy technique.

Alice in the Middle East (Alice ME) is a project designed to adapt the Alice software, develop new curricular materials, and provide professional development for teachers and students in the Middle East. For those who may be considering a collaborative project that would be conducted across international borders, we share lessons learned.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4e9	Dependent session types allow us to describe not only properties of the I/O behavior of processes but also of the exchanged data. In this paper we show how to exploit dependent session types to express proof-carrying communication. We further introduce two modal operators into the type theory to provide detailed control about how much information is communicated: one based on traditional proof irrelevance and one integrating digital signatures.
5834868425ff05a97b00d321	The major problems of modern software involve finding effective techniques and tools for organizing and maintaining large, complex programs. The key concept in modern programming for controlling complexity is abstraction, that is, selective emphasis on detail. This monograph discusses how the Ada programming language provides ways to support and exploit such abstraction techniques.
5834868425ff05a97b00d322	A typical function in embedded systems is performed by a device driver that provides a convenient interface between a system and the particular hardware requirements of an input/output device. Some of the functions performed by this program are buffering of requests for the device, ensuring the integrity and validity of these requests, and fielding interrupts from the hardware.
5834868425ff05a97b00d323	Ada [Department of Defense 82] is a language containing many advanced features not available previously in any widely used programming language. These features include: data abstraction mechanisms (packages, private types, derived types, overloading, user redefinition of operators), explicit parallelism and synchronization (tasks, entries, accept statements), a rich separate compilation facility and a powerful strong-typing mechanism. The use of these facilities allows for highly readable, efficient and maintainable programs.
5834868425ff05a97b00da38	This paper presents two new approaches to planning with uncertainty in position that achieve better performance than existing techniques and that are able to incorporate changes in the environment in near real-time. Both approaches reuse previous searches and replan when changes in the environment are detected.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb09	Computational issues in mechanism design are important, but have received insufficient research interest until recently. Limited computing hinders mechanism design in several ways, and presents deep strategic interactions between computing and incentives. On the bright side, the vast increase in computing power has enabled better mechanisms. Perhaps most interestingly, limited computing of the agents can be used as a tool to implement mechanisms that would not be implementable among computationally unlimited agents.
5834868425ff05a97b00daa8	In recent years, Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) have been proposed as a fundamental building block for Internet-scale distributed applications. Important functionalities such as searching has been added to the DHT's basic look up capability. However, supporting range queries efficiently remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm that decomposes a range query with length R_q into O (log R_q) sub-queries that are resolved by separate nodes corresponding to each sub-query.

5834868425ff05a97b00da7f	abstract Autonomous cross-country navigation requires planning algorithms which supports rapid traversal of challenging terrain while maintaining vehicle safety. The central theme of the work is the implementation of a planning system which solves this problem. The planning system uses a recursive trajectory generation algorithm, which generates spatial trajectories and then heuristically modifies them to achieve safe paths around obstacles. Velocities along the spatial trajectory are then set to insure a dynamically stable traversal.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0f9	In this paper, we describe results of a series of experiments investigating the effects of agent aiding on human teams. The role an agent played, its task, and the ease with which it communicated with its human teammates all influenced team behavior. Team supporting tasks such as relaying and reminding seemed particularly effective.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6e4	Decoding algorithm is a crucial part in statistical machine translation. We describe a stack decoding algorithm in this paper. We present the hypothesis scoring method and the heuristics used in our algorithm. We report several techniques deployed to improve the performance of the decoder. We also introduce a simplified model to moderate the sparse data problem and to speed up the decoding process. We evaluate and compare these techniques/models in our statistical machine translation system.

5834868425ff05a97b00d262	This paper presents analysis and results for a small and agile wall climbing robot's ability to regain lost adhesion due to degradation of dry fibrillar adhesives. To regain the lost adhesion, two feet are set to the surface and the robot performs a rocking motion on the side where the adhesion has dropped below a safety threshold. The rocking motion applies normal forces to preload the front and rear feet without letting the other foot detach from the surface by alternating the direction of the motor and only allowing small rotation of the leg.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2d1	One of the fundamental concepts in computational thinking is the separation of what from how and the relationship between them. Yet today's introductory education in computer science concentrates almost exclusively on how. Even when specifications are mentioned, they remain informal and are rarely actively practiced by the students.

5834868425ff05a97b00d6b5	Techniques are disclosed for augmenting hand-drawn animation of human characters with three-dimensional (3D) physical effects to create secondary motion. Secondary motion, or the motion of objects in response to that of the primary character, is widely used to amplify the audience's response to the character's motion and to provide a connection to the environment. These 3D effects are largely passive and tend to be time consuming to animate by hand, yet most are very effectively simulated in current animation software.

5834868425ff05a97b00c1be	We introduce a theory of polymorphic concurrent processes, which arises from an interpretation of second-order intuitionistic linear logic propositions as polymorphic session types, in the style of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic λ-calculus. The interpretation naturally generalizes recent discoveries on the correspondence between linear logic propositions and session types. In our proposed theory, polymorphism accounts for the exchange of abstract communication protocols, and dynamic instantiation of heterogeneous interfaces.

5834868425ff05a97b00e06b	It has been observed in many instances that markets have a tendency to segment themselves into distinct sub-markets. This paper presents a multi-agent model that illustrates emergent market segmentation. The model illustrates the way local optimization processes result in an emergent global behavior.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf8f	This paper concerns an outdoor mobile robot that learns to avoid collisions by observing a human driver operate a vehicle equipped with sensors that continuously produce a map of the local environment. We have implemented steering control that models human behavior in trying to avoid obstacles while trying to follow a desired path. Here we present the formulation for this control system and its independent parameters and then show how these parameters can be automatically estimated by observing a human driver.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf90	Executive Summary The Urban Challenge represents a technological leap beyond the previous Grand Challenges. The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868425ff05a97b00dacf	Abstract-Users of networked services traditionally have to know the network address of the desired service. As the network evolves from a simple infrastructure offering basic services (eg printers) into a sophisticated programmable infrastructure that supports a rich set of services such as virtual reality games, realtime video transcoding, and content providers, manual configuration of services becomes impractical. The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for the discovery of networked services.
5834868425ff05a97b00e11a	The Web is moving from being a collection of pages toward a collection of services that interoperate through the Internet. In this paper we show how ontological information improves on the growing Web services infrastructure by adding capability matching and a high degree of autonomy to web services so that they can automatically adapt to changing situations.
5834868425ff05a97b00dad2	Networking researchers have long faced a fundamental tension between the experimental realism of wireless testbeds on one hand, and the control and repeatability of simulation on the other hand. To overcome the stark tradeoff of these traditional alternatives, we have developed a wireless network emulator that enables both realistic and repeatable experimentation at network scale. A critical component in this emulator is the RF front end that converts RF signals to lower frequencies-where they can be digitized-and vice versa.
5834868425ff05a97b00e149	This paper presents a method for inferring threat in a military campaign through matching of battle field entities to a doctrinal template. In this work the set of random variables denoting the possible template matches for the scenario entities is a realization of a Markov random field. This approach does not separate low level fusion from high level fusion but optimizes both simultaneously. The result of the added high level context is a method that is robust to false positive and false negative, or missed, sensor readings.
5834868425ff05a97b00c201	We present the design and implementation of a file system which allows authorizations dependent on revocable and use-once policy certificates. Authorizations require explicit proof objects, combining ideas from previous authorization logics and Girard's linear logic. Use-once certificates and revocations lists are maintained in a database that is consulted during file access. Experimental results demonstrate that the overhead of using the database is not significant in practice.

In this case, the unit is written 1, and has the property that A⊗ 1 and 1⊗ A are equivalent to A. We can try to derive the rules for 1 systematically, by thinking of it as a multiplicative conjunction with zero components. Below, we show the binary rule first, and the nullary rule second.
5834868425ff05a97b00c20c	We continue to examine a computational interpretation of linear logic, where propositions are \nsession types, and proof are π-calculus processes. The ma- terial is drawn from a recent paper \nby Caires et al. [CPT12], which contains additional details and further references.   We have \nalready seen that A B, offering an input, also requires output in order to use the offer. But how \ndo we offer an output? A natural candidate is A ⊗ B, which is true if we can prove A and B \nseparately, each using a portion of the available linear hypotheses.
5834868425ff05a97b00d7dc	Scalable data analysis has come a long way since the introduction of the MapReduce paradigm a decade ago. In this tutorial we present algorithms for synchronous and asynchronous data processing. They are are capable of dealing with the amounts of data typically available on the internet. We given a brief description of the problems one faces when performing scalable machine learning on the internet. To motivate matters we provide a number of scenarios from spam filtering, advertising and collaborative filtering.
5834868425ff05a97b00d477	This paper describes a set of tools that enables developers to log and analyze the run-time behavior of distributed control systems. A feature of the tools is that they can be applied to distributed systems. The logging tools enable developers to instrument C or C++ programs so that data indicating state changes can be logged automatically in a variety of formats. In particular, run-time data from distributed systems can be synchronized into a single relational database. Tools are also provided for visualizing the logged data.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2e4	Official policies for controlling access to classified information in the US are quite complex and often difficult to enforce. We present an encoding of a common core of these policies in an authorization logic, and describe their rigorous enforcement in PCFS, a file system implemented for such purposes.
5834868425ff05a97b00d3cf	Micro-and nano-scale robotics has become a new emerging area of systems and controls area. These miniature robots have unique advantages such as accessing to unprecedented and small areas, increased flexibility, functionality and robustness, and being low cost, many (swarms), adaptive and distributed. The locomotion and manipulation dynamics of these robots are dominated by micro/nano-scale forces and the scaling effects. The long-term target is the miniaturization of these robots down to micrometers size.
5834868425ff05a97b00d41d	We report experimental results with bearings-only and range-only Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In the former case, we give the initial results from a new method that extends optimal shape-from-motion to incorporate angular rate and linear acceleration data. In the latter case, we have formulated a version of the SLAM problem that presumes a moving sensor able to measure only range to landmarks in the environment. Experimental results for both are presented.
5834868425ff05a97b00c308	We present a methodology for deriving veri ed programs that combines theorem proving and proof transformation steps. It extends the paradigm employed in systems like NuPrl where a program is developed and veri ed through the proof of the speci cation in a constructive type theory. We illustrate our methodology through an extended example| a derivation of Warshall's algorithm for graph reachability. We also outline how our framework supports the de nition, implementation, and use of abstract data types.
5834868425ff05a97b00d7f4	We propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. This generalizes previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings and graphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00c21a	In linear logic, there are two forms of conjunction. Besides the simultaneous conjunction (called multiplicative), there is an alternative conjunction (called additive), written A&B. We can achieve A&B as a goal with the current resources, if we can achieve both A and B with the current resources. This means that if we have a resource A & B we can choose to convert this to either A or B.
5834868425ff05a97b00e21e	Current publish/subscribe systems offer a range of expressive subscription languages for constraints. However, classical systems restrict the publish operation to be a single published object that contains only constants and no constraints. We introduce symmetric publish/subscribe, a novel generalization of publish/subscribe where both publications and subscriptions contain constraints in addition to constants. Published objects are matched to subscriptions by computing the intersection of their constraints.
5834868525ff05a97b00f06c	Tetrapod-like ZnO whisker (T-ZnO_w) is one kind whisker having three-dimensional four acicular and regular three-dimensional space structure. The authors carried out the classified summary on some commonly used T-ZnO_w preparation methods at home and abroad; according to the T-ZnO_w characteristics, summarized its application present situation in the respects of compound material enhancement, wear-resistance and anti-slippery, condition and static-electricity, fireproof and shock absorption etc.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7d4	In this paper we present a novel approach to categorizing comments in online reviews as either a qualified claim or a bald claim. We argue that this distinction is important based on a study of customer behavior in making purchasing decisions using online reviews. We present results of a supervised algorithm for learning this distinction. The two types of claims are expressed differently in language and we show that syntactic features capture this difference, yielding improvement over a bag-of-words baseline.
5834868425ff05a97b00e727	We present initial findings from an experiment in which participants played Mafia, an established role-playing game, with our robot. In one condition, the robot played like the rest of the participants and, in the other, the robot moderated the game. We discuss general aspects of the interaction, participants' perceptions, and the potential of this scenario for studying group spatial behavior from robotic platforms.
5834868425ff05a97b00c237	Church's system of simple types has proven to be remarkably robust: call-by-name, call-by-need, and call-by-value languages, with or without effects, and even logical frameworks can be based on the same typing rules. When type systems become more expressive, this unity fractures. An early example is the value restriction for parametric polymorphism which is necessary for ML but not Haskell; a later manifestation is the lack of distributivity of function types over intersections in call-by-value languages with effects.
5834868425ff05a97b00e22d	A computer assisted method of searching at least one corpus of information based on at least one query. The method includes creating a generative index based on the corpus and a mapping of terms of the query to terms of the corpus. The method also includes searching the generative index and the corpus with the query to create a result comprising a portion of the corpus, wherein the result satisfies the query.
5834868425ff05a97b00e240	Administrators frequently perform data integration “by hand” on the desktop as part of the execution of administrative tasks. This position paper discusses the application of mixed-initiative design to this problem. This design style leverages the interaction between a user and an intelligent assistant, minimizing the effort required to execute a task.
5834868425ff05a97b00d88a	svlab is an extensible, object oriented, package for kernel based learning in R. Its main objective is to provide a tool kit consisting of basic kernel functionality, optimizers and high level algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Kernel Principal Component Analysis which can be extended by the user in a very modular way. Based on this infrastructure kernel-based methods can be easily be constructed and developed.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8b3	This paper demonstrates tremor compensation for human subjects using an active handheld micromanipulator. This instrument uses optical and inertial sensing to detect its own motion, estimates tremor using linear filtering, and a flexure-based manipulator to actuate the tip. Compensation results while tracing a line with the tool are presented for both novice users and a trained surgeon. Learning effects from repetition of the trials over a ten-day period are described.
5834868425ff05a97b00c313	We describe a module system for Elf, a logic programming language based on the LF logical framework. The static part of module calculus addresses name-space management and structured presentation of deductive systems. The dynamic part addresses search-space management and modularization of logic programs.
5834868425ff05a97b00d548	A fabricated microstructure comprising at least one protrusion capable of providing an adhesive force at a surface of between about 60 and 2,000 nano-Newtons. A stalk supports the protrusion at an oblique angle relative to a supporting surface. The microstructure can adhere to different surfaces.
5834868425ff05a97b00c9b3	Imperfect-information games, where players have private information, pose a unique challenge in artificial intelligence. In recent years, Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker, a popular version of poker, has emerged as the primary benchmark for evaluating game-solving algorithms for imperfectinformation games. We demonstrate a winning agent from the 2016 Annual Computer Poker Competition, Baby Tartanian8.
5834868425ff05a97b00d480	We describe a technique called imagining which uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative simulation techniques to solve a problem where neither alone would suffice. We illustrate the imagining technique using the domain of geologic interpretation and argue for why the two types of simulation are necessary for problems of this sort. We also discuss the strengths of each simulation technique and how they support each other in the problem solving process.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf7f	In results from urban and natural environments, we were able to successfully classify LZs from point cloud maps collected on a helicopter. The presented method enables detailed assessment of LZs without an landing approach, thereby improving safety. Still, the method assumes low-noise point cloud data. We intend to increase robustness to outliers while still detecting small obstacles in future work.
5834868425ff05a97b00d484	This paper presents optimizations for verifying systems with complex time-invariant constraints. These constraints arise naturally from modeling physical systems, eg, in establishing the relationship between different components in a system. To verify constraint-rich systems, we propose two new optimizations. The first optimization is a simple, yet powerful, extension of the conjunctivepartitioning algorithm. The second is a collection of BDD-based macro-extraction and macro-expansion algorithms to remove state variables.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0f7	We describe the FALCON system for handling multimedia queries with relevance feedback. FALCON distinguishes itself in its ability to handle even disjunctive queries on metric spaces. Our experiments show that it performs well on both real and synthetic data in terms of precision/recall, speed of convergence, individual query speed, and scalability. Moreover, it can easily take advantage of off-the-shelf spatial-and metric-access methods.
5834868425ff05a97b00cfbd	Mobile crowdsensing is becoming a vital technique for environment monitoring, infrastructure management, and social computing. However, deploying mobile crowdsensing applications in large-scale environments is not a trivial task. It creates a tremendous burden on application developers as well as mobile users. In this paper we try to reveal the barriers hampering the scale-up of mobile crowdsensing applications, and to offer our initial thoughts on the potential solutions to lowering the barriers.
5834868425ff05a97b00cfbc	The convergence of mobile computing and cloud computing is predicated on a reliable, high-bandwidth end-to-end network. This basic requirement is hard to guarantee in hostile environments such as military operations and disaster recovery. In this article, the authors examine how VM-based cloudlets that are located in close proximity to associated mobile devices can overcome this challenge. This article is part of a special issue on the edge of the cloud.
5834868425ff05a97b00c325	Throughout the years, several typing disciplines for the π-calculus have been proposed. Arguably, the most widespread of these typing disciplines consists of session types. Session types describe the input/output behaviour of processes and traditionally provide strong guarantees about this behaviour (ie deadlock-freedom and fidelity). While these systems exploit a fundamental notion of linearity, the precise connection between linear logic and session types has not been well understood.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5f3	We present a novel formulation of CPL, a constructive logic of provability that is closely connected to the Gödel-Löb logic of provability. Our logical formulation allows modal operators to talk about both provability and non-provability of propositions at reachable worlds. We use this logic as a basis for a discussion of negation in logic programming.
5834868425ff05a97b00c583	In this paper we discuss the motivation for a novel style of tutorial dialogue system that emphasizes reflection in a design context by engaging students in negotiation dialogues. Our current research focuses on the hypothesis that negotiation-style dialogue will lead to better learning than previous tutorial dialogue systems because (1) it motivates students to explain more in order to justify their thinking, and (2) it supports the students' meta-cognitive ability to ask themselves the right questions about the choices they make.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7df	We introduce a novel topic segmentation approach that combines evidence of topic shifts from lexical cohesion with linguistic evidence such as syntactically distinct features of segment initial and final contributions. Our evaluation shows that this hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when applied to loosely structured, spontaneous dialogue. Further analysis reveals that using dialogue exchanges versus dialogue contributions improves topic segmentation quality.
5834868425ff05a97b00c585	Background Puerto Ricans and African Americans, two ethnic groups with a significant proportion of African ancestry, share a disproportionate burden of asthma in the United States, and recent findings suggest that African ancestry influence lung function in African American adults (N Eng J Med 2010; 363: 321-30). We hypothesized that a greater proportion of African ancestry is associated with decreased lung function and increased asthma severity in Puerto Rican (PR) children.
5834868425ff05a97b00e293	We consider the task of identifying and labeling the semantic arguments of a predicate that evokes a FrameNet frame. This task is challenging because there are only a few thousand fully annotated sentences for supervised training. Our approach augments an existing model with features derived from FrameNet and PropBank and with partially annotated exemplars from FrameNet. We observe a 4% absolute increase in F1 versus the original model.
5834868425ff05a97b00cfc1	We describe a technique called lookaside caching that combines the strengths of distributed file systems and portable storage devices, while negating their weaknesses. In spite of its simplicity, this technique proves to be powerful and versatile. By unifying distributed storage and portable storage into a single abstraction, lookaside caching allows users to treat devices they carry as merely performance and availability assists for distant file servers. Careless use of portable storage has no catastrophic consequences.
5834868425ff05a97b00e29d	Systems and methods for gravity independent gripping and drilling are described. The gripping device can also comprise a drill or sampling devices for drilling and/or sampling in microgravity environments, or on vertical or inverted surfaces in environments where gravity is present. A robotic system can be connected with the gripping and drilling devices via an ankle interface adapted to distribute the forces realized from the robotic system.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7f7	We report on techniques for using discourse context to reduce ambiguity and improve translation accuracy in a multi-lingual (Spanish, German, and English) spoken language translation system. The techniques involve statistical models as well as knowledge-based models including discourse plan inference. This work is carried out in the context of the Janus project at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Karlsruhe.
5834868425ff05a97b00c596	We present a novel authoring infrastructure1 for accelerating the rate of content creation for coached practice environments. In an initial authoring stage, the tool supports quick authoring of scaffolded problems, drawing upon principles established in prior intelligent tutoring authoring research. However, in contrast to earlier approaches, the result of this stage is a structured template than can be used to generate a multitude of variations on the same problem concept.
5834868425ff05a97b00cfd9	This paper explores the concept of early discard for interactive search of unindexed data. Processing data inside storage devices using downloaded searchlet code enables Diamond to perform efficient, application-specific filtering of large data collections. Early discard helps users who are looking for``needles in a haystack''by eliminating the bulk of the irrelevant items as early as possible. A searchlet consists of a set of application-generated filters that Diamond uses to determine whether an object may be of interest to the user.
5834868425ff05a97b00e382	This special issue is about the frontier between decidability and undecidability and related problems. At a moment when the world community of computer science is about to celebrate the centenary of Alan Turing's birthday, and although this contribution is not officially affiliated with any of the many celebratory events, we can say confidently that this volume continues the initial work of Alan Turing.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2b4	The big missing questions on cache optimization are how and when generally to transform loops? Is there a big common systematic picture? How to get fast by vectorizing and/or parallelizing loops after the loop transformations have made some loops parallelizable? And, finally, how can we use more fancy transformations for complicated problems.
5834868425ff05a97b00c260	We present a novel extension of normal form games that we call biased games. In these games, a player's utility is influenced by the distance between his mixed strategy and a given base strategy. We argue that biased games capture important aspects of the interaction between software agents. Our main result is that biased games satisfying certain mild conditions always admit an equilibrium. We also tackle the computation of equilibria in biased games.
5834868425ff05a97b00c36d	Understanding smartphone users is fundamental for creating better smartphones, and improving the smartphone usage experience and generating generalizable and reproducible research. However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users.
5834868425ff05a97b00c9d4	A method of processing an exchange includes providing a solver/analyzer for determining a solution that includes at least one of a winning allocation and feasible allocations. At least one bid is received at the solver/analyzer, with each bid including at least one item and an associated price. Exchange description data (EDD) is associated with the at least one bid. The EDD is also received at the solver/analyzer. The processing of the at least one bid is modified in accordance with the at least one feature included in the EDD.
5834868425ff05a97b00e79a	We develop a supersense taxonomy for adjectives, based on that of GermaNet, and apply it to English adjectives in WordNet using human annotation and supervised classification. Results show that accuracy for automatic adjective type classification is high, but synsets are considerably more difficult to classify, even for trained human annotators. We release the manually annotated data, the classifier, and the induced supersense labeling of 12,304 WordNet adjective synsets.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb97	REMARK. The ideas presented here are a development of work first presented in [Le]. There the type U was called 0 and treated as a type of ordinals. It was used to give an involved construction of an interpretation of the system in [My]. The new step is to realise that U itself gives the interpretation of CST.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbdc	Domain theory for denotational semantics is over thirty years old. There are many variations on the idea and many interesting constructs that have been proposed by many people for realizing a wide variety of types as domains. Generally, the effort has been to create categories of domains that are cartesian closed (that is, have products and function spaces interpreting typed lambda-calculus) and permit solutions to domain equations (that is, interpret recursive domain definitions and perhaps untyped lambda-calculus).
5834868425ff05a97b00e7f8	We characterize upper probabilities that are invariant with respect to permutations. A one-to-one relationship is established between generalized upper probabilities, upper probabilities and 2-alternating upper probabilities and certain classes of point functions. In particular, 2-alternating upper probabilities, which are ubiquitous in the statistical robustness literature, are given a simple interpretation. We also show that undominated invariant generalized upper probabilities do not exist.
5834868425ff05a97b00e804	On démontre qu'un principe semblable au principe de vraisemblance découle du principe de censure. De plus, on démontre que le principe de vraisemblance découle de ce principe de censure lorsqu'il est conjugué à une version faible du principe de conditionnement.
5834868425ff05a97b00d404	A method for detecting an obstacle in a spatial area is disclosed. The method includes scanning the spatial area, classifying each reflection point in the spatial area as one of an obstacle reflection point and a non-obstacle reflection point, fusing the obstacle reflection points, and generating statistics associated with the obstacle.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2fe	We present an algorithm for verifying that some specified arguments of an inductively defined relation in a dependently typed λ-calculus are uniquely determined by some other arguments. We prove it correct and also show how to exploit this uniqueness information in coverage checking, which allows us to verify that a definition of a function or relation covers all possible cases. In combination, the two algorithms significantly extend the power of the meta-reasoning facilities of the Twelf implementation of LF.
5834868425ff05a97b00d426	The present invention relates to providing enhanced panoramic images with an improved panoramic mirror. A panoramic mirror is provided with a controlled vertical field of view. The controlled vertical field of view improves the resolution of a viewable panoramic image by eliminating portions of unwanted images from the viewable panoramic image.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5aa	In this paper we discuss TFLEX, a newly built parser using a grammar for deep interpretation already used by the TRIPS parser, with the left-corner parsing algorithm from the LCFLEX parser. The primary goal of this integration is to improve performance on long utterances. We discuss a novel pruning algorithm utilising both ambiguity packing and TRIPS rule preference scores, and show that TFLEX pruning performs better than best-first parsing with chart size limits used in TRIPS on a standard dialogue test set.
5834868425ff05a97b00cffb	A summary of and historical perspective on work done to implement easy-to-share distributed file systems based on the Unix model are presented. Andrew and Coda are distributed Unix file systems that embody many of the recent advances in solving the problem of data sharing in large, physically dispersed workstation environments. The Andrew architecture is presented, the scalability and security of the system are discussed. The Coda system is examined, with emphasis on its high availability.
5834868425ff05a97b00c829	In this paper, we explore student dropout behavior in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). We use as a case study a recent Coursera class from which we develop a survival model that allows us to measure the influence of factors extracted from that data on student dropout rate. Specifically we explore factors related to student behavior and social positioning within discussion forums using standard social network analytic techniques. The analysis reveals several significant predictors of dropout.
5834868425ff05a97b00cffd	The Information Technology Center (ITC), a collaborative effort between IBM and Carnegie-Mellon University, is in the process of creating Andrew, a prototype computing and communication system for universities. This article traces the origins of Andrew, discusses its goals and strategies, and gives an overview of the current status of its implementation and usage.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5b1	We combine corpus driven linguistic knowledge with experimentally obtained sensorimotor data in an effort to better specify the minimum conceptual representation of a motion event that distinguishes it from all other events, which still are largely presented in a vague and not objectively calculated quantitative method. We use American English and Modern Greek data as a case study, in order to focus on the clustering of motor actions and its correspondence to previous linguistic classifications of both languages.
5834868425ff05a97b00c840	We present a method of estimating a snake robot's motion inside and outside of straight pipes using only knowledge of the robot's joint angles. We accomplish this by introducing a novel method to constructing a body frame for the robot that is aligned with the centerline of the pipe. In addition to greatly simplifying the motion model this method allows us to accurately estimate the diameter of the pipe. We present experimental results using a 16-DOF snake robot traversing the inside and outside of straight pipes.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5b6	We report on an effort to evaluate the efficacy of automated assessment and feedback of the quality of collaborative discourse in the context of an online project based course. Results of automated assessment and impact on collaborative process are evaluated over a semester-long course.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5b8	This symposium focuses on forms of classroom discourse that have the potential to lead to societal change. The deployment of these forms of discourse that we designate as deliberative discourse provides unique moments during which a communicative rationalization is realized. We present very different programs in civic education, science, philosophy or history that realize this communicative rationalization. The common denominator of these programs is that they all provide long-term learning experiences.
5834868425ff05a97b00c845	This paper details the design and architecture of a series elastic actuated snake robot, the SEA Snake. The robot consists of a series chain of 1-DOF modules that are capable of torque, velocity and position control. Additionally, each module includes a high-speed Ethernet communications bus, internal IMU, modular electro-mechanical interface, and ARM based on-board control electronics.
5834868425ff05a97b00e2fa	Trust is a mechanism for managing the uncertainty about autonomous entities and the information they store, and so can play an important role in any decentralized system. As a result, trust has been widely studied in multiagent systems and related fields such as the semantic web. Here we introduce a formal system of argumentation that can be used to reason about trust. We explore some of the simple properties of the system and we illustrate its application on a benchmark problem from the trust literature.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5bf	The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence presented the 2000 Fall Symposium Series was held on Friday through Sunday, 3 to 5 November, at the Sea Crest Oceanfront Conference Center. The titles of the five symposia were (1) Building Dialogue Systems for Tutorial Applications,(2) Learning How to Do Things,(3) Parallel Cognition for Embodied Agents,(4) Simulating Human Agents, and (5) Socially Intelligent Agents: The Human in the Loop.
5834868425ff05a97b00de24	We present MOPED, a framework for Multiple Object Pose Estimation and Detection that seamlessly integrates single-image and multi-image object recognition and pose estimation in one optimized, robust, and scalable framework. We address two main challenges in computer vision for robotics: robust performance in complex scenes, and low latency for real-time operation. We achieve robust performance with Iterative Clustering Estimation (ICE), a novel algorithm that iteratively combines feature clustering with robust pose estimation.
5834868525ff05a97b00f4a4	在基于Mean-Shift 的目标跟踪算法中, 尺度自适应机制是算法研究的一个重要方向. 一种典型的方法采用Lindeberg 的尺度空间理论以获取目标尺度信息. 但现有算法中将尺度由2-D 矢量压缩为1-D 量, 未能精细地刻画目标仿射变换时的尺度变化, 从而限制了算法的适用范围. 为此, 该文将尺度维1-D 滤波推广至2-D, 构造得到了相应的4-D 尺度空间, 并利用空间维和尺度维的Mean-Shift 交替迭代, 实现了同时在空间位置和尺度方向对目标的有效跟踪, 提高了算法在目标尺度变化时的自适应性, 并扩大了算法的适用范围.
5834868425ff05a97b00d47b	The problems of human detection, tracking, and attention recognition can be solved more effectively by integrating multiple sensory modalities, such as vision and range data. We present a system that uses a laser range scanner and a single camera to detect and track people, and to classify their attention relative to a socially interactive robot.
5834868425ff05a97b00d48c	In this paper we quantify several performance metrics for the Ambler, a six-legged robot configured for autonomous traversal of Mars-like terrain. We present power consumption measures for walking on sandy terrain and for vertical lifts at different velocities. We document the performance of a novel dead-reckoning approach, and analyze its accuracy. We describe the results of autonomous walking experiments in terms of terrain traversed, walking speed and endurance.
5834868425ff05a97b00c853	The goal of the NRC report on DNA typing was to answer a “crescendo of questions concerning DNA typing,” many of them in the areas of population genetics and statistics. Unfortunately, few of these questions were answered adequately. In lieu of answering these questions, the panel proposed another conservative method of forensic inference, the “ceiling principle.” Aside from its extreme conservativeness, this new method is difficult to justify because it is based on inadequate population genetics and statistical theory.
5834868425ff05a97b00d044	In most real-world (electronic) marketplaces, there are additional considerations besides maximizing immediate economic value. We present a sound way of taking such considerations into account via side constraints and non-price attributes, and show that side constraints (such as budget, limit on the number of winners, and exclusive-or) have a significant impact on the complexity of market clearing.
5834868425ff05a97b00e330	Abstract—The relation between DAML-S, a language for the description of Web services grounded in the Semantic Web, and the growing Web services infrastructure based on WSDL is, by an large, still an open question. In this paper we describe a mapping from WSDL to DAML-S whose contribution is twofold: on the theoretical side it clearly shows what information is contributed by the DAML-S specification, on a more practical side it facilitates the compilation of DAML-S descriptions.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5c8	Prior work supports the pedagogical value of conceptual maps for offering students an overview of a topic as well as the connections between subtopics. In this poster we describe a system that uses automated topic modeling technology to map the topics and sub-topics in a collection of documents.

In this paper we analyze human-robot dialogues that occur during uncontrolled interactions and estimate relations between the initial dialogue turns and patterns of discourse that are indicative of such user traits as persistence and politeness. The significant effects shown in this preliminary study suggest that initial dialogue turns may be useful in modeling a user's interaction style.

5834868525ff05a97b00ea02	The paper presents a strategy to optimize various non-coplanar laminate thin-walled structures. The optimization procedure is performed at two specially constructed levels for the purposes of minimization of the total weight and maximization of the globe stiffness of the structures. The FEM is used to obtain the structural response and a search algorithm is adopted to find the optimal ply thickness and ply orientation of each lamina. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed scheme.

5834868425ff05a97b00cc72	Effortless one-touch capture of video is a unique capability of wearable devices such as Google Glass. We use this capability to create a new type of crowd-sourced system in which users receive queries relevant to their current location and opt-in preferences. In response, they can send back live video snippets of their surroundings. A system of result caching, geolocation and query similarity detection shields users from being overwhelmed by a flood of queries.

To this end we have developed a general method that can be used to provide prescriptions as to where and how to dig for a variety of excavator configurations and tasks. This paper presents simulation results of a front-end loader performing a loading task. In addition, preliminary results from a trenching experiments conducted with a robot in our lab are presented.

5834868425ff05a97b00cadd	We present the first model of optimal voting under adversarial noise. From this viewpoint, voting rules are seen as error-correcting codes: their goal is to correct errors in the input rankings and recover a ranking that is close to the ground truth. We derive worst-case bounds on the relation between the average accuracy of the input votes, and the accuracy of the output ranking. Empirical results from real data show that our approach produces significantly more accurate rankings than alternative approaches.
5834868425ff05a97b00ddce	We document the empirical results from Carnegie Mellon University's entry into the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials. Our system seamlessly and intelligently integrates recent advances in autonomous manipulation with the perspective and intuition of an expert human operator. Virtual fixtures are used as the common language between the operator and the motion planner. The planning system then solves a guided manipulation problem to perform disaster-response tasks.
5834868525ff05a97b00f5a2	Transfer learning algorithms are used when one has sufficient training data for one supervised learning task (the source/training domain) but only very limited training data for a second task (the target/test domain) that is similar but not identical to the first. Previous work on transfer learning has focused on relatively restricted settings, where specific parts of the model are considered to be carried over between tasks. Recent work on covariate shift focuses on matching the marginal distributions on observations $ X $ across domains.
5834868425ff05a97b00c9c6	The seminar Computing and Markets facilitated a very fruitful interaction between economists and computer scientists, which intensified the understanding of the other disciplines' tool sets. The seminar helped to pave the way to a unified theory of markets that takes into account both the economic and the computational issues---and their deep interaction.
5834868425ff05a97b00e5e6	In Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) a linear or nonlinear frequency transformation compensates for different vocal tract lengths. Finding good estimates for the speaker specific warp parameters is a critical issue. Despite good results using the Maximum Likelihood criterion to find parameters for a linear warping, there are concerns using this method. We searched for a new criterion that enhances the inter-class separability ir1 addition to optimizing the distribution of each phonetic class. Using such a criterion.
5834868425ff05a97b00de0e	We present an autonomous multi-robot system that can collect objects from indoor environments and load them into a dishwasher rack. We discuss each component of the system in detail and highlight the perception, navigation, and manipulation algorithms employed. We present results from several public demonstrations, including one in which the system was run for several hours and interacted with several hundred people.
5834868425ff05a97b00c3be	We formulate a layered model for object detection and multi-class segmentation. Our system uses the output of a bank of object detectors in order to define shape priors for support masks and then estimates appearance, depth ordering and labeling of pixels in the image. We train our system on the PASCAL segmentation challenge dataset and show good test results with state of the art performance in several categories including segmenting humans.
5834868525ff05a97b00edb5	The SDH protection for Ethernet ring, bandwidth adjustment of LCAS and the transmission delay of virtual concatenation are analyzed. Combination protection is suggested based on the advantages of the above two protection methods. Analysis on the test results about the SDH network and analysis shows that the combination protection is more efficient than both MSP protection and UPSR protection.
5834868425ff05a97b00c889	Cartography arose in the beginning of the 18th century in Russia with the first map covering the whole Russian empire; it was made by IK Kirillov in 1734 and held the scale 1: 11, 7 Mill. In 1745 it was followed by the “Mappa Generalis Totius Imperii Russici”(1: 8, 9 Mill.) developed by the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences under the main supervision of the astronomer Joseph Nicolas Delisle (1688-1768), and with co-operation of Leonhard Euler 1 (see [KayoJ]).
5834868425ff05a97b00e34e	Recently, Virzi (1992) presented data that support three claims regarding sample sizes for usability studies:(1) observing four or five participants will allow a usability practitioner to discover 80% of a product's usability problems,(2) observing additional participants will reveal fewer and fewer new usability problems, and (3) more severe usability problems are easier to detect with the first few participants. Results from an independent usability study clearly support the second claim, partially support the first, but fail to support the third.
5834868425ff05a97b00e368	We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared translation task. We participated in two language pairs, German–English and Hindi–English. Our innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree transla-tion, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create “synthetic trans-lation options” that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the training data, and a method of combining the out-put of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.
5834868425ff05a97b00e36a	In this paper we explore the written dialog behavior of participants in anon line discussion for automatic identification of participants who pursue power within the discussion group. We employ various standard unsupervised machine learning approaches to make this prediction. Our approach relies on the identification of certain discourse structures and linguistic techniques used by participants in the discussion. We achive an F-measure of 69.5% using unsupervised methods.
5834868425ff05a97b00e36d	It is well known that the set of all natural numbers divisible by a fixed modulus can be recognized by a finite state machine, assuming that the numbers are written in standard base-representation. It is much harder to determine the state complexity of the minimal recognizer [1]. In this article we discuss the size of minimal recognizers for a variety of numeration systems, including reverse base-representation and the Fibonacci system.
5834868425ff05a97b00e37e	We introduce a formal definition of Wolfram's notion of computational process based on cellular automata, a physics-like model of computation. There is a natural classification of these processes into decidable, intermediate and complete. It is shown that in the context of standard finite injury priority arguments one cannot establish the existence of an intermediate computational process.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2a4	For a particular Kripke structure at hand, a systematic exploration of the state space can be used to establish if a formula of modal logic is true or false in this Kripke structure. This process is called model checking [CGP99] and has been pioneered by Clarke and Emerson [CE81] and by Queille and Sifakis [QS82].
5834868425ff05a97b00c3c8	Over the past few years we have developed a complete learning-based system for detecting and localizing objects in images. Our system represents objects using mixtures of deformable part models. These models are trained using a discriminative method that only requires bounding boxes for the objects in an image. The approach leads to efficient object detectors that achieve state of the art results on the PASCAL and INRIA person datasets.

5834868425ff05a97b00c2c6	Consider a k-bit counter for which it costs 1 token to flip a bit. In this problem, you will assess the worst case time complexity of a single increment operation and the amortized time complexity of performing n increment operations of this counter, where n= 2k. State your answers in terms of k and n.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2c9	We introduce a new way of reasoning about invariance in terms of foot-prints in a Hoare logic for recursive programs with (unbounded) arrays. A foot-print of a statement is a predicate that describes that part of the state that can be changed by the statement. We define invariance of an assertion with respect to a foot-print by means of a logical operation. This new Hoare logic is applied in a new simpler and modular proof of correctness of the well-known Quicksort sorting algorithm.
5834868425ff05a97b00e380	Converting a finite state machine to a regular expression is a bit of an academic exercise. The key problem is that for all approaches to yield manageable expressions one needs to simplify the intermediate results. There are heuristics to do that, but in general simplification is computationally hard.
5834868425ff05a97b00e381	We study iterated transductions defined by a class of inverse transducers over the binary alphabet. The transduction semigroups of these automata turn out to be free Abelian groups and the orbits of finite words can be described as affine subspaces in a suitable geometry defined by the generators of these groups. We show that iterated transductions are rational for a subclass of our automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5d7	A system (400) for positioning and navigating an autonomous vehicle (310) allows the vehicle (310) to travel between locations. Position information (432) is derived from global positioning system satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) or other sources (624) when the satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) are not in the view of the vehicle (310). Navigation of the vehicle (310) is obtained using the position information (432), route information (414), obstacle detection and avoidance data (416), and on board vehicle data (908 and 910).
5834868525ff05a97b00efee	The adaptive output-tracking problem of a class of nonlinear systems with uncontrollable unstable linearization was proposed. Using the modified adaptive adding a power integrator technique as a basic tool, a new smooth adaptive state feedback controller was designed. This controller can guarantee the global boundedness of all variables of the closed-loop systems and the output tracking error arbitrary small.
5834868425ff05a97b00cc8a	When offloading computation from a mobile device, we show that it can pay to perform additional on-device work in order to reduce the offloading workload. We call this offload shaping, and demonstrate its application at many different levels of abstraction using a variety of techniques. We show that offload shaping can produce significant reduction in resource demand, with little loss of application-level fidelity.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2d6	We describe Concurrent C0, a type-safe C-like language with contracts and session-typed communication over channels. Concurrent C0 supports an operation called forwarding which allows channels to be combined in a well-defined way. The language's type system enables elegant expression of session types and message-passing concurrent programs. We provide a Go-based implementation with language based optimizations that outperforms traditional message passing techniques.
5834868525ff05a97b00edc6	The general inverse maximum flow problem is considered, where lower and upper bounds for the flow are changed so that a given feasible flow becomes a maximum flow and the modification cost that is measured by sum-type weighted Hamming distance is minimum. We present the combinatorial algorithm for solving the problem that runs in strongly polynomial times.

Through the study on these attacks and the deep understanding of the security of principal cloud infrastructure, some countermeasures in dealing with these security problems are proposed in this paper.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca12	Abstract—In this paper, we consider the impact of het-erogeneity in the outgoing bandwidth capabilities of nodes on existing protocol designs for overlay multicast. This issue has received limited attention in the community although experience with the real deployment of an overlay multicast prototype [6] has revealed this to be a first-order concern. We consider representative designs from two key classes of protocols-performance-centric and DHT-based.

In an implementation, one or more computer-readable media comprise instructions that are executable to cause a processor executing the instructions to select, based on a performance goal, which of a plurality of processors is to further handle a device interrupt and when the selected processor is available, notify the selected processor to further handle the device interrupt.

5834868425ff05a97b00de77	Although current humanoid controllers can rely on inverse kinematics or dynamics of the full humanoid system, powered prosthetic legs or assistive devices cannot, because they do not have access to the full states of the human system. This limitation creates the need for alternative control strategies. One strategy is to embed fundamental knowledge about legged dynamics and control in local feedback. In a previous paper, we have developed a control model of human locomotion which relies mostly on local feedback.
5834868425ff05a97b00c2eb	We introduce a theory of polymorphic concurrent processes, which arises from an interpretation of second-order intuitionistic linear logic propositions as polymorphic session types, in the style of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic λ-calculus. The interpretation naturally generalizes recent discoveries on the correspondence between linear logic propositions and session types. In our proposed theory, polymorphism accounts for the exchange of abstract communication protocols, and dynamic instantiation of heterogeneous interfaces.

5834868425ff05a97b00c2f7	This is a demonstration of TPS, a theorem proving system for classical type theory (Church's typed λ-calculus). TPS can be used interactively or automatically, or in a combination of these modes. An important feature of TPS is the ability to translate between expansion proofs and natural deduction proofs.
5834868425ff05a97b00c425	Binary voting trees provide a succinct representation for a large and prominent class of voting rules. In this paper, we investigate the PAC-learnability of this class of rules. We show that, while in general a learning algorithm would require an exponential number of samples, if the number of leaves is polynomial in the size of the set of alternatives then a polynomial training set suffices. We apply these results in an emerging theory: automated design of voting rules by learning.
5834868425ff05a97b00de88	Semiparametric models are useful tools in the case where domain knowledge exists about the function to be estimated or emphasis is put onto understandability of the model. We extend two learning algorithms-Support Vector machines and Linear Programming machines to this case and give experimental results for SV machines.
5834868425ff05a97b00de8d	We present a fast training algorithm for the kernel Fisher discriminant classifier. It uses a greedy approximation technique and has an empirical scaling behavior which improves upon the state of the art by more than an order of magnitude, thus rendering the kernel Fisher algorithm a viable option also for large datasets.
5834868425ff05a97b00c434	Kidney exchange provides a life-saving alternative to long waiting lists for patients in need of a new kidney. Fielded exchanges typically match under utilitarian or near-utilitarian rules; this approach marginalizes certain classes of patients. In this paper, we focus on improving access to kidneys for highly-sensitized, or hard-to-match, patients. Toward this end, we formally adapt a recently introduced measure of the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency---the price of fairness---to the standard kidney exchange model.

5834868425ff05a97b00de91	The concept of Support Vector Regression is extended to a more general class of convex cost functions. Moreover it is shown how the resulting convex constrained optimization problems can be efficiently solved by a Primal-Dual Interior Point path following method. Both computational feasibility and improvement of estimation is demonstrated in the experiments.
5834868425ff05a97b00de93	Online learning algorithms have impressive convergence properties when it comes to risk minimization and convex games on very large problems. However, they are inherently sequential in their design which prevents them from taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures. In this paper we prove that online learning with delayed updates converges well, thereby facilitating parallel online learning.

5834868425ff05a97b00c2fc	We propose a refinement of the type theory underlying the LF logical framework by a form of subtypes and intersection types. This refinement preserves desirable features of LF, such as decidability of type-checking, and at the same time considerably simplifies the representations of many deductive systems.
5834868425ff05a97b00de9a	Under the assumption of asymptotically unbiased estimators we show that there exists a nontrivial choice of the insensitivity parameter in Vapnik's ε-insensitive loss function which scales linearly with the input noise of the training data. This finding is backed by experimental results.
5834868425ff05a97b00c44e	We consider the problem of fairly dividing a heterogeneous divisible good among agents with different preferences. Previous work has shown that envy-free allocations, ie, where each agent prefers its own allocation to any other, may not be efficient, in the sense of maximizing the total value of the agents. Our goal is to pinpoint the most efficient allocations among all envy-free allocations. We provide tractable algorithms for doing so under different assumptions regarding the preferences of the agents.
5834868425ff05a97b00c304	A logical framework is a meta-language for the formalization of deductive systems. We provide a brief introduction to logical frameworks and their methodology, concentrating on LF. We use first-order logic as the running example to illustrate the representations of syntax, natural deductions, and proof transformations. We also sketch a recent formulation of LF centered on the notion of canonical form, and show how it affects proofs of adequacy of encodings.
5834868425ff05a97b00de9c	We propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. This generalizes previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings and graphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca57	The material presented here represents the consensus of a subgroup of the the ITC Common System Services group.

5834868425ff05a97b00c456	We introduce a game-theoretic model of diffusion of technologies, advertisements, or influence through a social network. The novelty in our model is that the players are interested parties outside the network. We study the relation between the diameter of the network and the existence of pure Nash equilibria in the game. In particular, we show that if the diameter is at most two then an equilibrium exists and can be found in polynomial time, whereas if the diameter is greater than two then an equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist.
5834868425ff05a97b00c30a	Higher-order logical frameworks provide a powerful technology to reason about object languages with binders. This will be demonstrated for the case of the λµ-calculus with two different binders which can most elegantly be represented using a third-order constant. Since cases of third-and higher-order encodings are very rare in comparison with those of second order, a second-order representation is given as well and equivalence to the third-order representation is proven formally.
5834868425ff05a97b00c30d	This user's guide describes the current version of a succession of implementations of the logical framework LF.

5834868425ff05a97b00c45e	Although recent years have seen a surge of interest in the computational aspects of social choice, no specific attention has previously been devoted to elections with multiple winners, eg, elections of an assembly or committee. In this paper, we characterize the worst-case complexity of manipulation and control in the context of four prominent multiwinner voting systems, under different formulations of the strategic agent's goal.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca62	MultiRPC is an invocation mechanism that enables a client to access multiple servers in a single \nremote-procedure call. Parallelism is obtained from concurrency of processing on servers and \nfrom the overlapping of retransmissions and timeouts. Each of the parallel calls retains the semantics \nand functionality of the underlying remote procedure call mechanism.

5834868425ff05a97b00ca63	Programming languages shape the way we think about programming; they are the primary embodiments of ideas about program organization and programming methodology. Moreover, principles of language design extend to the design of virtually all interfaces between programs and humans: command languages, editors, text formatters, database query systems, etc. Many aspects of language design raise significant implementation problems whose solutions can be applied in many programming contexts.
5834868425ff05a97b00deac	We incorporate prior knowledge to construct nonlinear algorithms for invariant feature extraction and discrimination. Employing a unified framework in terms of a nonlinearized variant of the Rayleigh coefficient, we propose nonlinear generalizations of Fisher's discriminant and oriented PCA using support vector kernel functions. Extensive simulations show the utility of our approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00deb1	In this paper, we consider collaborative filtering as a ranking problem. We present a method which uses Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization and optimizes ranking instead of rating. We employ structured output prediction to optimize directly for ranking scores. Experimental results show that our method gives very good ranking scores and scales well on collaborative filtering tasks.
5834868425ff05a97b00debe	Empirical evidence suggests that hashing is an effective strategy for dimensionality reduction and practical nonparametric estimation. In this paper we provide exponential tail bounds for feature hashing and show that the interaction between random subspaces is negligible with high probability. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with experimental results for a new use case---multitask learning with hundreds of thousands of tasks.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca88	Computational offloading services at the edge of the Internet for mobile devices are becoming a reality. Using a wide range of mobile applications, we explore how such infrastructure improves latency and energy consumption relative to the cloud.

5834868425ff05a97b00debf	We explore methods for incorporating prior knowledge about a problem at hand in Support Vector learning machines. We show that both invariances under group transfonnations and prior knowledge about locality in images can be incorporated by constructing appropriate kernel functions.
5834868425ff05a97b00dec0	Motivation: Computational approaches to protein function prediction infer protein function by finding proteins with similar sequence, structure, surface clefts, chemical properties, amino acid motifs, interaction partners or phylogenetic profiles. We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00ca98	We describe a system called Olive that freezes and precisely reproduces the environment necessary to execute software long after its creation. It uses virtual machine (VM) technology to encapsulate legacy software, complete with all its software dependencies. This legacy world can be completely closed-source: there is no requirement for availability of source code, nor a requirement for recompilation or relinking. The entire VM is streamed over the Internet from a web server, much as video is streamed today.
5834868425ff05a97b00c33c	Qatar is a worldwide leader in liquid natural gas (LNG) production and is poised to lead the world in gas-to-liquids (GTL) production with the commissioning of the Pearl GTL facility. Unfortunately, Qatar's gas fields contain non-negligible quantities of corrosive and toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), resulting in the ongoing need for expensive and labor intensive pipe inspection to detect and monitor areas of corrosion. Such inspection is critical to plant integrity, worker safety, and to ensure the economic productivity of the facility.
5834868425ff05a97b00c483	We give an algebraic quantifier elimination algorithm for the first-order theory over any given finite field using Gröbner basis methods. The algorithm relies on the strong Nullstellensatz and properties of elimination ideals over finite fields. We analyze the theoretical complexity of the algorithm and show its application in the formal analysis of a biological controller model.
5834868425ff05a97b00decf	We introduce a family of kernels on graphs based on the notion of regularization operators. This generalizes in a natural way the notion of regularization and Greens functions, as commonly used for real valued functions, to graphs. It turns out that diffusion kernels can be found as a special case of our reasoning. We show that the class of positive, monotonically decreasing functions on the unit interval leads to kernels and corresponding regularization operators.
5834868425ff05a97b00ded0	In this paper a correspondence is derived between regularization operators used in regularization networks and support vector kernels. We prove that the Green's Functions associated with regularization operators are suitable support vector kernels with equivalent regularization properties. Moreover, the paper provides an analysis of currently used support vector kernels in the view of regularization theory and corresponding operators associated with the classes of both polynomial kernels and translation invariant kernels.
5834868425ff05a97b00c49b	We introduce differential game logic (dGL) for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid games, ie games on hybrid systems combining discrete and continuous dynamics. Unlike hybrid systems, hybrid games allow choices in the system dynamics to be resolved adversarially by different players with different objectives. The logic dGL can be used to study the existence of winning strategies for such hybrid games. We present a simple sound and complete axiomatization of dGL relative to the fixpoint logic of differential equations.
5834868425ff05a97b00c59c	4 Conclusion In the previous sections we showed that the ProPars system by using symbolic procedures is enabled to parse sentences of arbitrary length. In addition, symbolic procedures were used to store intermediate parsing results such that a syntax tree can be assembled after the parsing process has been completed. Both of these problems are not solved by other connectionist based systems.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5a6	We present our ongoing work towards using the concept of transactivity for automatically assessing learning of students working together in a collaborative setting. Transactive segments of student dialogue are proposed as useful components of conversation summaries generated for instructors. Experimental evaluation of this hypothesis shows promising results. Further, initial results are presented for automatic identification of transactive contributions in student dialogue.
5834868425ff05a97b00c408	Given an unknown tournament over {1,…, n}, we show that the query complexity of the question “Is there a vertex with outdegree n− 1?”(known as a Condorcet winner in social choice theory) is exactly 2n−⌊ log (n)⌋− 2. This stands in stark contrast to the evasiveness of this property in general digraphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00dee4	We study a simple, 3-state Mealy automaton and analyze the group of transductions defined by this automaton. In particular it is demonstrated that iterating the transductions produces rational equivalence relations. A critical ingredient in this study is a special type of normal form for transductions suggested by Knuth.
5834868425ff05a97b00df2a	In this paper we propose an extension of the service oriented architecture that supports discovery of Web services across organization boundaries. We provide a detailed discussion of both the architectural and implementation considerations, and we provide an empirical evaluation that shows that indeed our prototype implementation scales with both the number of Web services and the number of organizations involved.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7e8	This demo abstract presents an interactive tool for supporting error analysis for text mining, which is situated within the Summarization Integrated Development Environment (SIDE). This freely downloadable tool was designed based on repeated experience teaching text mining over a number of years, and has been successfully tested in that context as a tool for students to use in conjunction with machine learning projects.
5834868425ff05a97b00cdbf	Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to end performance in wireless and lossy systems. We compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9d3	Welcome to the 2015 ICCV workshop of 3D Reconstruction and Understanding with Video and Sound. We believe the availability of new types of input sensors and algorithms to process the sensor data has been the major driving factor for innovation in computer vision. With the proliferation of commodity RGBD cameras, many new techniques have been developed that take advantage of the additional depth channel for different applications, including reconstruction, segmentation, and understanding.
5834868425ff05a97b00cdd6	Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions of Internet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content, rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internet does not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric naming proposals, since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes.
5834868425ff05a97b00c81b	This paper describes AUTOSEM, a robust semantic interpretation framework that can operate both at parse time and repair time. The evaluation demonstrates that AUTOSEM achieves a high level of robustness efficiently and without requiring any hand coded knowledge dedicated to repair.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9db	This disclosure generally relates to systems and methods that facilitate employing exemplar Histogram of Oriented Gradients Linear Discriminant Analysis (HOG-LDA) models along with Localizer Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to train a classification model to classify actions in videos by learning poses and transitions between the poses associated with the actions in a view of a continuous state represented by bounding boxes corresponding to where the action is located in frames of the video.
5834868425ff05a97b00c84e	The power of multiple testing procedures can be increased by using weighted p-values (Genovese, Roeder and Wasserman 2005). We derive the optimal weights and we show that the power is remarkably robust to misspecification of these weights. We consider two methods for choosing weights in practice. The first, external weighting, is based on prior information. The second, estimated weighting, uses the data to choose weights.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0ac	Multi agent systems are subject to performance bottlenecks in cases where agents cannot perform tasks by themselves due to insufficient resources. Solutions to such problems include passing tasks to others or agent migration to remote hosts. We propose agent cloning as a more comprehensive approach to the problem of local agent overloads. According to our paradigm, agents may clone, pass tasks to others, die or merge.
5834868425ff05a97b00c712	Surgical Robotics was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 21–25 July 2014. The school was held at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and at Allegheny General Hospital (part of Allegheny Health Network) and drew 62 trainees from six countries. Figure 1 shows the trainees, which included engineering graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, and other early-stage researchers. An international group of leading engineering and surgical faculty members was recruited to serve as instructors.
5834868425ff05a97b00d88c	We present an algorithm to compute the LDL factorization of a matrix of the form ZZ+ Λ, which can be computed in O (nm2) time. Here, m is the rank of Z and n is the rank of the diagonal matrix Λ. We also show how the linear system (ZZ+ Λ) x= y can be solved in O (mn) time using our factorization. In addition, this yields an LDV decomposition algorithm for Z which can be obtained in O (m3) time. Finally, we show how rank-1 modifications of such matrices can be computed in at most O (mn) time.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0fe	Modern computing paradigms have frequently adopted concepts from distributed systems. The quest for scalability, reliability and cost reduction has led to the development of massively distributed systems, which extend organisational boundaries. Voluntary computing environments (such as BOINC), Grids (such as EGEE and Globus), and more recently Cloud Computing (both open source and commercial) have established themselves as a range of distributed systems.

5834868425ff05a97b00e57c	A traditional transfer system in machine translation maps between language structures and an intermediate representation. Our connectionist transfer system maps from f-structures of one language to f-structures of another language. It encodes the intermediate representation implicitly in neural networks' activation patterns. The system is learnable, therefore it does not need any e ort in hand-crafting the representation and mapping rules. Experiments show the system has good scalability and generalizability performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00e5a7	In this paper we investigate the automatic segmentation of recorded telephone conversations based on models for speech and non-speech to find sentence-like chunks for use in speech recognition systems. Presented are two different approaches, based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), respectively. The proposed methods provide segmentations that allow for competitive speech recognition performance in terms of word error rate (WER) compared to manual segmentation.
5834868425ff05a97b00da24	We describe an efficient method for planning in environments for which prior maps are plagued with uncertainty. Our approach processes the map to determine key areas whose uncertainty is crucial to the planning task. It then incorporates the uncertainty associated with these areas using the recently developed PAO algorithm to produce a fast, robust solution to the original planning task.
5834868425ff05a97b00ccb7	Radical improvements in battery technology are unlikely—their energy density is already very high. Incremental improvements are likely, but some of those improvements will be eaten up by the energy demands of increased functionality in mobile devices. It is therefore essential to explore alternative approaches to extending battery life.
5834868425ff05a97b00d624	The Carnegie Mellon University Planetary Rover project is developing the Ambler, a six-legged robot designed for planetary exploration. The authors have developed reliable and efficient control, perception and planning algorithms suitable for navigating rugged terrain. The components have been integrated into a system that autonomously walks the Ambler along routes and over obstacles.
5834868425ff05a97b00c72b	The feasibility of providing vibrotactile information to humans in a teleoperated robotic system were investigated. Four channels of vibrotactile feedback were given to a human operator to relay force information from a teleoperated dextrous robotic hand. Significant advantage was seen when the operator was provided one or two channels of feedback.
5834868425ff05a97b00d625	The second annual Robot Competition and Exhibition sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence was held in Washington DC on 13-15 July 1993 in conjunction with the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This article describes the robots that placed first and second in each event and compares their strategies and their resulting successes and difficulties.
5834868425ff05a97b00da2a	A basic requirement of autonomous vehicles is that of guaranteeing the safety of the vehicle by avoiding hazardous situations. This paper analyses this requirement in general terms of the resolution and accuracy of sensors and computations. Several nondimensional expressions emerge which characterize requirements in canonical form.
5834868425ff05a97b00d2cc	This report covers the period from September 20, 2007 through December 10, 2007. During that time, we developed the task board for the project, ported the behaviors that we needed for doing the task, developed initial task procedures for doing the task, mounted and calibrated cameras, and performed an initial set of docking experiments. Each of these will be described in more detail in the subsequent sections.
5834868425ff05a97b00c511	We present a system of natural deduction and associated term calculus for intuitionistic non-commutative linear logic (INCLL) as a conservative extension of intuitionistic linear logic. We prove subject reduction and the existence of canonical forms in the implicational fragment.
5834868425ff05a97b00e608	We introduce a word clustering algorithm which uses a bilingual, parallel corpus to group together words in the source and target language. Our method generalizes previous mutual information clustering algorithms for monolingual data by incorporating a statistical translation model. Preliminary experiments have shown that the algorithm can effectively employ the constraints implicit in bilingual data to extract classes which are well suited to machine translation tasks.
5834868425ff05a97b00d32e	We believe that previous computer science curricula have been too compartment'llized. They \ncontain many courses focused on specific areas, but offer little or no overview of the \nmaterial. We attempt to organize courses by coherence of the content, not necessarily following \ntraditional boundaries. We also attempt to blend theory and practice in virtually all courses. We \nbelieve that a strong emphasis on recurring themes (eg abstraction and reliability) will help to \nbridge the gaps between topics that, on the surface, may seem unrelated.
5834868425ff05a97b00d997	We propose a new boosting algorithm which similaxly to v-Support-Vector Classification allows for the possibility of a pre-specified fraction v of points to lie in the margin area or even on the wrong side of the decision boundary. It gives a nicely interpretable way of controlling the trade-off between minimizing training error and capacity. Furthermore, it can act as a filter for finding and selecting informative patterns from a database.
5834868425ff05a97b00d99b	We describe Hokusai, a real time system which is able to capture frequency information for streams of arbitrary sequences of symbols. The algorithm uses the CountMin sketch as its basis and exploits the fact that sketching is linear. It provides real time statistics of arbitrary events, eg streams of queries as a function of time. We use a factorizing approximation to provide point estimates at arbitrary (time, item) combinations. Queries can be answered in constant time.
5834868425ff05a97b00c526	We present new variants of known proofs of cut elimination for intuitionistic and classical sequent calculi. In both cases the proofs proceed by three nested structural inductions, avoiding the explicit use of multi-sets and termination measures on sequent derivations. This makes them amenable to elegant and concise representations in LF, which are given in full detail.
5834868425ff05a97b00c529	We show that standard formulations of intersection type systems are unsound in the presence of computational effects, and propose a solution similar to the value restriction for polymorphism adopted in the revised definition of Standard ML. It differs in that it is not tied to let-expressions and requires an additional weakening of the usual subtyping rules. We also present a bi-directional type-checking algorithm for the resulting language that does not require an excessive amount of type annotations and illustrate it through some examples.
5834868425ff05a97b00da41	We propose a resolution-optimal planner that considers uncertainty while optimizing any monotonic objective function such as mobility cost, risk, energy expended, etc. The resulting path is a one that minimizes the expected cost value of the objective function, while ensuring that the uncertainty in the position of the robot does not compromise the safety of the robot or the reachability of the goal.

5834868425ff05a97b00c52e	We show that the problem of partial type inference in the nth-order polymorphic &lgr;-calculus is equivalent to nth-order unification. On the one hand, this means that partial type inference in polymorphic &lgr;-calculi of order 2 or higher is undecidable. On the other hand, higher-order unification is often tractable in practice, and our translation entails a very useful algorithm for partial type inference in the &ohgr;-order polymorphic &lgr;-calculus. We present an implementation in &lgr; Prolog in full.
5834868425ff05a97b00d35b	Today's tech-savvy boomers will remain comfortable with technology as they age, though they may need different interfaces. They need help with evaluating technical resources, but they will continue to adapt, tailor, configure, and program those resources. They need assistants, not supervisors”.

Left panel is from a TA learned on 2D synthetic datasets of Sec. 4, while the right panel is from a TA modeling high dimensional face images under illumination variations. The plots demonstrate that samples mixes very quickly after around 20 Gibbs iterations.

5834868425ff05a97b00c532	Algorithms for unification and anti-unification in the calculus of constructions, where occurrences of free variables (the variables subject to instantiation) are restricted to higher-order patterns, are presented. Most general unifiers and least common anti-instances are shown to exist and are unique up to a simple equivalence. The unification algorithm is used for logic program execution and type and term reconstruction in the current implementation of Elf and has shown itself to be practical.
5834868425ff05a97b00da47	We describe an approach to mobility planning for autonomous navigation of multiple vehicles in unstructured environments. At the lowest level, this approach uses command arbitration in order to combine command recommendation from driving behaviors. Driving behaviors include local behaviors such as obstacle avoidance or goal tracking, and strategic behavior such as route planning to distant goals. Obstacle avoidance is performed by evaluating a fixed command set with respect to a terrain map built from 3D sensors.
5834868425ff05a97b00d363	The design of the Alphard language responded to concerns from several areas, including programming methodology, specification and verification, and object code efficiency. There is often tension among these concerns, with different concerns favoring different language decisions. This paper describes the interaction of the three concerns in the language design and in particular in the design of the iteration facility.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd64	Local service discovery exposes sensitive information about identity, location, and relationships. We present empirical evidence that suggests the release of this information in wireless environments poses a real danger to our privacy. We then discuss the challenges in the design of Tryst, an architecture that enhances the confidentiality of existing service discovery mechanisms.
5834868425ff05a97b00c539	We present a type-based approach to eliminating array bound checking and list tag checking by conservatively extending Standard ML with a restricted form of dependent types. This enables the programmer to capture more invariants through types while type-checking remains decidable in theory and can still be performed efficiently in practice. We illustrate our approach through concrete examples and present the result of our preliminary experiments which support support the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00d860	We present a general framework for extrapolation of kernels, which can be used to extend graph kernels, reduced rank approximations, local linear embeddings (LLE), or the Fisher kernel to various regularization settings. Central to this is the fact that regularization and function expansion need not arise from the same set of basis functions. Hence we can use one or more regularizers to describe the function class, which induces a dot product on the set of basis functions which is used for estimation purposes.
5834868425ff05a97b00d863	We present a principled method to combine kernels under joint regularization constraints. Central to our method is an extension of the representer theorem for handling multiple joint regularization constraints. Experimental evidence shows the feasibility of our approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00e1b7	In part 2 of this Trends & Controversies installment, we continue exploring the state of the art, current practices, and future directions for Semantic Web services. SWS aims to bring Semantic Web technology-for representing, sharing, and reasoning about knowledge-to bear in Web service contexts. The objective is to enable a fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use and the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies for working with services.

5834868425ff05a97b00e65c	The authors present a multimodal approach to interactive recovery from speech recognition errors for the design of speech user interfaces. They propose a framework to compare various error recovery methods, arguing that a rational user will prefer interaction methods which provide an optimal trade off between accuracy, speed and naturalness. They describe a prototypical implementation of multimodal interactive error recovery and present results from a preliminary evaluation in form filling and speech to speech translation tasks.
5834868425ff05a97b00dd5c	We extend the well-known interval analysis method so that it can be used to gather global flow information for individual array elements. Data dependences between all array accesses in different basic blocks, different iterations of the same loop, and across different loops are computed and represented as labelled arcs in a program flow graph. This approach results in a uniform treatment of scalars and arrays in the compiler and builds a systematic basis from which the compiler can perform numerous global optimizations.
5834868425ff05a97b00c798	We study a new problem, the wakeup problem, that seems to be very fundamental in distributed computing. We present efficient solutions to the problem and show how these solutions can be used to solve the consensus problem, the leader election problem, and other related problems. The main question we try to answer is, how much memory is needed to solve the wakeup problem? We assume a model that captures important properties of real systems that have been largely ignored by previous work on cooperative problems.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8a7	One of the fundamental problems of learning theory is the following: suppose we are given two classes of objects. We are then faced with a new object, and we have to assign it to one of the two classes. This problem, referred to as (binary) pattern recognition, can be formalized as follows: we are given empirical data (x1, y1),...,(xm, ym)∈ X×{±1},(1) and we want to estimate a decision function f: X→{±1}. Here, X is some nonempty set from which the patterns xi are taken, usually referred to as the domain; the yi are called labels or targets.

The result shows that there are not remarkable differences between the elder archers and the younger archers in each index of α wave in EEG in quiet condition, but the differences exist in the restoring period after their over-hyperventilation. The result will provide some reference for personal training of archers.

The method includes forming an opening through an etch layer and to a barrier layer, expanding the opening in the etch layer at the barrier layer, filling the opening with a material, removing the barrier layer from the material in the opening, and removing the etch layer from the material in the opening.
5834868425ff05a97b00cdcd	Network functions virtualization (NFV) is an appealing vision that promises to dramatically reduce capital and operating expenses for cellular providers. However, existing efforts in this space leave open broad issues about how NFV deployments should be instantiated or how they should be provisioned. In this paper, we present an initial attempt at a framework that will help network operators systematically evaluate the potential benefits that different points in the NFV design space can offer.

The interpolation can approximate the interpolated function very well by selecting suitable parameter and weight coefficient. And what is more, a new method of value control is employed to control the shape of curves, and the optimal solution with minimal strain energy for the value control equation is derived. Also when the weight coefficient is in [0, 1], The error estimation formula of this interpolation function is obtained.
5834868425ff05a97b00da62	Natural language provides a flexible, intuitive way for people to command robots, which is becoming increasingly important as robots transition to working alongside people in our homes and workplaces. To follow instructions in unknown environments, robots will be expected to reason about parts of the environments that were described in the instruction, but that the robot has no direct knowledge about. However, most existing approaches to natural language understanding require that the robot's environment be known a priori.

The system is initialized with a map (in the form of a graph) as well as audio files associated with several locations in the map. The system consists of: GPS receiver module, serial port, compact flash module, stereo codec, power manager...
5834868425ff05a97b00e676	Since we cannot exclude that speech recognizers fail sometimes, it is important to examine how users react to recognition errors. In correction situations, speaking style becomes more accentuated to disambiguate the original mistake. We examine the effect of speaking style in such situations on speech recognition performance. Our results indicate that hyperarticulated effects occur in correction situations and decrease word accuracy significantly.
5834868425ff05a97b00e67f	In this paper, we present a summarization system for spontaneous dialogues which consists of a novel multi-stage architecture. It is specifically aimed at addressing issues related to the nature of the texts being spoken vs. written and being dialogical vs. monological. The system is embedded in a graphical user interface and was developed and tested on transcripts of recorded telephone conversations in English and Spanish (C ALLHOME).
5834868425ff05a97b00e690	In this work we describe a new method that adjusts time-delays and the widths of time-windows in artificial neural networks automatically. The input of the units are weighted by a gaussian input-window over time which allows the learning rules for the delays and widths to be derived in the same way as it is used for the weights. Our results on a phoneme classification task compare well with results obtained with the TDNN by Waibel et al., which was manually optimized for the same task.

Though most researchers have focused on two-dimensional and near-wall motion, this letter uses a defocused optical tracking method to quantify the three-dimensional motion of 5 μ m diameter polystyrene beads driven by attached Serratia marcescens bacteria. Away from walls the beads trace out helical trajectories, demonstrating kinematics produced by near-constant forces and torques.
5834868425ff05a97b00da69	We present a heuristic-based propagation algorithm for solving restricted Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our approach, which combines ideas from deterministic search and recent dynamic programming methods, focuses computation towards promising areas of the state space. It is thus able to significantly reduce the amount of processing required in producing a solution. We present a number of results comparing our approach to existing algorithms on a robotic path planning domain.
5834868425ff05a97b00da6a	Abstract—We are interested in the challenges of long-term, long-distance tight multirobot coordination. In this paper, we discuss the Constrained Exploration domain that pushes the boundaries of tightly-coordinated multirobot teams. We formalize this problem and consider the role of intentional coordination approaches in addressing its numerous challenges. Finally, we present three intentional coordination approaches to solving different aspects of the domain.
5834868425ff05a97b00e206	This paper describes Ariadne, a Java tool for the Eclipse IDE, that links technical and social dependencies. Ariadne is based on the observation that technical dependencies among software components create social dependencies among the software developers implementing these components. We describe our approach for creating technical, socio-technical and social dependencies from a software project. We describe possible uses of our approach and tool as well as discuss briefly related work.
5834868425ff05a97b00da6e	Presents an approach for real time planning and execution of the motions of complicated robotic systems. The approach is motivated by the observation that a robot's task can be described as a series of simple steps, or a script. The script is a general template which encodes knowledge for a class of tasks and is fitted to a specific instance of a task. The script receives information about its environment in the form of parameters, which it uses to bind variables in the template and allows it to deal with the current task conditions.

5834868425ff05a97b00d3c7	Abstract—This paper proposes two small-scale agile wall climbing robots able to navigate on smooth vertical surfaces which use adhesive materials for attachment. Geckobot is a lizard-inspired climbing robot with similar kinematics to a gecko climbing gait. Waalbot uses two actuated legs with rotary motion and two passive revolute joints at each foot. Due to their compact design, a high degree of miniaturization is possible. Each has onboard power, computing, and wireless communication which allow for semi-autonomous operation.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6af	Most statistical machine translation systems employ a word-based alignment model. In this paper we demonstrate that word-based alignment is a major cause of translation errors. We propose a new alignment model based on shallow phrase structures, and the structures can be automatically acquired from parallel corpus. This new model achieved over 10% error reduction for our spoken language translation task.
5834868425ff05a97b00ddbb	The Hint Factory is a novel application of Markov decision processes (MDPs), a reinforcement learning technique, to automatically generate contextualized hints from past student data. We describe the process of adding the Hint Factory to an existing, non-adaptive, software program used to teach deductive logic in an undergraduate Philosophy course, and we report the initial results of a pilot study to test the hint generation capabilities in a real class setting.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc81	Planning for multiple mobile robots in dynamic environments involves determining the optimal path each robot should follow to accomplish the goals of the mission, given the current knowledge available about the world. As knowledge increases or improves, the planning system should dynamically reassign robots to goals in order to continually minimize the time to complete the mission. In this paper, an example problem in this domain is explored and performance results of such a dynamic planning system are presented.

5834868425ff05a97b00e6db	In this paper, we present a non-intrusive eye tracker which can detect and track a user's eyes in real time as soon as the face appears in the view of the camera without special lighting or any marks on the user's face. We also discuss the problem of gaze monitoring. We employ neural networks to estimate a user's eye gaze using the images of user's both eyes as input to the neural networks. We have collected 4 sets of data from 4 different users using the eye tracker and have trained and tested several neural networks.
5834868425ff05a97b00daa7	In this paper, we propose the notion of a tunable available bandwidth measurement tool that can be adapted to the execution environment. We first briefly describe our work on IGI and PTR, and then classify and compare the current available bandwidth measurement techniques. We then report on our experience in adapting PTR for the use during TCP Slow Start, which leads to the idea of a tunable measurement tool. Finally, we present the research challenges that must be addressed to develop such a tool.
5834868425ff05a97b00e2db	We describe work on an agent-based model that captures the relationship between the investment that a society makes in education and the outcome in terms of the health of the society's economy. In this work we created an agent-based version of an equation-based model from the economics literature, and explored various settings for parameters that control the behaviors of the agents and their environment.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd33	Discovering low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional observations has always been an important task in machine learning. The compact representation can be used for exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and data visualization. There exist a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques, which can be broadly classified into: Linear methods (such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)), Non-linear mappings (such as autoencoders), and Proximity based methods (such as Local Linear Embedding (LLE)[6]).
5834868425ff05a97b00d765	A fundamental problem in comparative genomics is to compute the distance between two genomes. For two genomes without duplicate genes, we can easily compute a variety of distance measures in linear time, but the problem is NP-hard under most models when genomes contain duplicate genes. Sankoff proposed the use of exemplars to tackle the problem of duplicate genes and gene families: each gene family is represented by a single gene (the exemplar for that family), chosen so as to optimize some metric.
5834868425ff05a97b00d766	Background Native structures of proteins are formed essentially due to the combining effects of local and distant (in the sense of sequence) interactions among residues. These interaction information are, explicitly or implicitly, encoded into the scoring function in protein structure prediction approaches—threading approaches usually measure an alignment in the sense that how well a sequence adopts an existing structure; while the energy functions in Ab Initio methods are designed to measure how likely a conformation is near-native.
5834868425ff05a97b00cae9	A method of determining a winning allocation in an auction or exchange includes receiving at least one buy bid that includes a price-quantity demand curve and/or receiving at least one sell bid that includes a price-quantity supply curve. The received curves are utilized to determine clearing prices therefor that maximize a clearing surplus. A winning allocation is determined based on the clearing prices.
5834868425ff05a97b00ddd9	This paper summarizes ongoing work with a mobile manipulator (Mobipulator). We describe the system architecture of the latest version of the robot, a hierarchy of robot motion commands (the Mobipulation library) that can be snapped together to generate complicated paths easily, a configuration space planner that plans wheel motions to manipulate paper, and a visual servoing system to monitor and correct errors in robot motion.
5834868425ff05a97b00dddb	One goal of assistive robotics is to design interactive robots that can help disabled people with tasks such as fetching objects. When people do this task, they coordinate their movements closely with receivers. We investigated how a robot should fetch and give household objects to a person. To develop a model for the robot, we first studied trained dogs and person-to-person handoffs. Our findings suggest two models of handoff that differ in their predictability and adaptivity.
5834868425ff05a97b00da9c	An Eulerian photochemical air quality model (AQM) simulates atmospheric processes such as advection and diffusion, pollutant emissions, and chemical reactions using a grid system defined in a fixed frame of reference, usually the surface of the earth. Because the modeling framework is convenient to incorporate many atmospheric processes affecting air quality, Eulerian models have been widely used to study the effects of emissions control strategies on air quality.
5834868425ff05a97b00e250	Many mobile applications rely on location information gained from location services on mobile devices. However, continuously tracking the device location with high accuracy drains the battery quickly. Furthermore, sensing the same location can be redundant when multiple devices are co-located. In this paper, we develop a crowdsourcing-based location service, E2A2 (energy efficient and accuracy aware), which places colo-cated devices into groups, and uses group location to represent individual device location.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3b1	Linear cellular automata have a canonical representation in terms of labeled de Bruijn graphs. We will show that these graphs, construed as semiautomata, provide a natural setting for the study of cellular automata. For example, we give a simple algorithm to determine reversibility and surjectivity of the global maps. We also comment on Wolfram's question about the growth rates of the minimal finite state machines associated with iterates of a cellular automaton.
5834868425ff05a97b00e261	This paper describes the e-XML component suite, a modular product for integrating heterogeneous data sources under an XML schema and querying in real-time the integrated information using XQuery, the emerging W3C standard for XML query. We describe the two main components of the suite, ie, the repository for warehousing XML and the mediator for distributed query processing. We also discuss some typical applications.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0c4	When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance between short binary hashes, we shown that even if the similarity is symmetric, we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two distinct code maps. Ie~ by approximating the similarity between $ x $ and $ x'$ as the hamming distance between $ f (x) $ and $ g (x') $, for two distinct binary codes $ f, g $, rather than as the hamming distance between $ f (x) $ and $ f (x') $.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8d3	Using an instrumented surgical tool, high-precision recordings of hand tremor were taken during vitreoretinal microsurgery in a rabbit model in vivo. The data obtained using a compact, custom six-degree-of-freedom inertial sensing module were filtered and analyzed to characterize the physiological hand tremor of the surgeon. Tremor during the most delicate part of the procedure was measured at a vector magnitude of 30 μm rms. Non-tremulous, lower-frequency components of instrument movement were also characterized.
5834868425ff05a97b00e275	Distributed databases operating over wide-area networks such as the Internet, must deal with the unpredictable nature of the performance of communication. The response times of accessing remote sources can vary widely due to network congestion, link failure, and other problems. In such an unpredictable environment, the traditional iterator-based query execution model performs poorly. We have developed a class of methods, called query scrambling, for dealing explicitly with the problem of unpredictable response times.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0ae	We propose a unified framework for neural net normalization, regularization and optimization, which includes Path-SGD and Batch-Normalization and interpolates between them across two different dimensions. Through this framework we investigate issue of invariance of the optimization, data dependence and the connection with natural gradients.
5834868425ff05a97b00c605	In this paper we describe an application of a lightly supervised Role Identification Model (RIM) to the analysis of coordination in Wikipedia talk page discussions. Our goal is to understand the substance of important coordination roles that predict quality of the Wikipedia pages where the discussions take place. Using the model as a lens, we present an analysis of four important coordination roles identified using the model, including Workers, Critiquers, Encouragers, and Managers.
5834868425ff05a97b00c611	Through the lens of Expectancy Value Theory, we examine the effect of help giver badges, information about helper expertise, and up-and downvoting on help seeking in a MOOC discussion forum. Results show that badges alleviated the negative impact on help seeking introduced by up-and downvoting.

5834868425ff05a97b00d18c	4 Results The quadruped robot's simplified first prototype could run on water surface (see Fig. 1)[3]. Roll and pitch dynamic stability of the robot was challenging [4]. In a second prototype (see Fig. 2), a passive tail was shown to stabilize the pitch motion while a wide body with a large roll moment of inertia at the trotting gait enabled a stable roll motion. The robot's dynamics favors scaling down of the robot size scale.
5834868425ff05a97b00c64c	Text categorization technology can be used to streamline the process of content analysis of corpus data. However, while recent results for automatic corpus analysis show great promise, tools that are currently being used for HCI research and practice do not make use of it. Here, we empirically evaluate trade-offs between semi automatic and hand labeling of data in terms of speed, validity, and reliability of coding in order to assess the usefulness of incorporating this technology into HCI tools.
5834868425ff05a97b00c64d	We combined two existing methods for rapid tutor development:“plug-in tutor agents”[6] and an authoring tool suite (CTAT) that supports the creation of tutors “by demonstration”[2]. The combined approach, which has not been tried before, is suited for adding tutoring capabilities to an existing problem-solving environment, for example an off-the-shelf simulator. Connecting the components (ie, the simulator and CTAT) requires programming but once that is done,“Pseudo Tutors” are created “by demonstration.

The method may include receiving input data from a user including at least natural language associated with a user request; analyzing the user input data with an intermediary agent; selecting at least one form based on analyzing the user input data; and, executing at least one update based on at least one form.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7c9	Developing cyber-physical systems involves multiple engineering domains, eg, timing, logical correctness, thermal resilience, and mechanical stress. In today's industrial practice, these domains rely on multiple analyses to obtain and verify critical system properties. Domain differences make the analyses abstract away interactions among themselves, potentially invalidating the results. Specifically, one challenge is to ensure that an analysis is never applied to a model that violates the assumptions of the analysis.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf7e	Real-time and reliable localization is a prerequisite for autonomously performing high-level tasks with micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Nowadays, most existing methods use vision system for 6DoF pose estimation, which can not work in degraded visual environments. This paper presents an onboard 6DoF pose estimation method for an indoor MAV in challenging GPS-denied degraded visual environments by using a RGB-D camera. In our system, depth images are mainly used for odometry estimation and localization.
5834868425ff05a97b00c56d	A novel method of using task fingerprinting to predict outcome measures such quality, errors, and the likelihood of cheating, particularly as applied to crowd sourced tasks. The technique focuses on the way workers work rather than the products they produce. The technique captures behavioral traces from online crowd workers and uses them to build predictive models of task performance. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated across three contexts including classification, generation, and comprehension tasks.
5834868425ff05a97b00c56e	Table 2 shows the complete results of various LSSVMmodels on the bAbI datasets for each subtask. In our experiments, we observed a similar general pattern of improvement of LSSVM over the baselines as well as the improvement due to multi-task learning. Again task classification helped the multi-task learner the most and the QA classification helped more than the QClassification. The results on performance within the subtasks described in the main paper are substantiated by these numbers.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf8e	This paper concerns an outdoor mobile robot that learns to avoid collisions by observing a human driver operate a vehicle equipped with sensors that continuously produce a map of the local environment. We have implemented steering control that models human behavior in trying to avoid obstacles while trying to follow a desired path. Here we present the formulation for this control system and its independent parameters and then show how these parameters can be automatically estimated by observing a human driver.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb7a	Disclosed is a method and system for determining one or more performance characteristics of a target server. A command is transmitted from a coordinator to a plurality of clients. The command instructs the plurality of clients to each transmit a request targeting a sub-system of said target server. A response time is then received from each client and a performance characteristic is determined from the received response times.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4a5	The design of the Alphard language responded to concerns from several areas, including programming methodology, specification and verification, and object code efficiency. There is often tension among these concerns, with different concerns favoring different language decisions. This paper describes the interaction of the three concerns in the language design and in particular in the design of the iteration facility.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4ae	Conventional software specifications and reasoning based on such specifications do not accommodate uncertainty in the specifications, nor do they support the informal, subjective sorts of reasoning that many people use when making decisions about complex systems. We propose a notation for representing specifications in which attributes have different levels of confidence and we discuss ways that uncertain information can contribute usefully to software decisions.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7aa	This paper extends recent work in linear switching-time optimization to a class of impulsive systems. It is shown that for cases with and without reference the first derivative of a cost function over an arbitrary number of impulse times can be calculated by computing two or three total integrals respectively, which can be done offline. This makes it possible to numerically optimize a cost function online algebraically. A simulated example drawn from data association to which impulse optimization methods are applied is provided.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbe2	We present an interactive and automated theorem prover for free higher-order logic. Our implementation on top of the Isabelle/HOL framework utilizes a semantic embedding of free logic in classical higher-order logic. The capabilities of our tool are demonstrated with first experiments in category theory.
5834868425ff05a97b00d49c	This paper presents a general approach to robust execution monitoring. The goal is to provide coverage for many types of unexpected and unanticipated situations, while at the same time enabling the robot to quickly detect, and react to, specific contingencies. The approach uses a hierarchy of monitors, structured in layers of increasing specificity. We present the general approach, and show its application in the domain of indoor mobile robot navigation.

5834868425ff05a97b00d5bd	A system (400) for positioning and navigating an autonomous vehicle (310) allows the vehicle (310) to travel between locations. Position information (432) is derived from global positioning system satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) or other sources (624) when the satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) are not in the view of the vehicle (310). Navigation of the vehicle (310) is obtained using the position information (432), route information (414), obstacle detection and avoidance data (416), and on board vehicle data (908 and 910).
5834868425ff05a97b00d0c1	We revisit the choice of SGD for training deep neural networks by reconsidering the appropriate geometry in which to optimize the weights. We argue for a geometry invariant to rescaling of weights that does not affect the output of the network, and suggest Path-SGD, which is an approximate steepest descent method with respect to a path-wise regularizer related to max-norm regularization. Path-SGD is easy and efficient to implement and leads to empirical gains over SGD and AdaGrad.
5834868425ff05a97b00df62	Abstract—In this paper we describe a domain for the application of the results of the research conducted as part of project 6 of BPP11. This domain, and specific scenarios we will construct in the domain, is intended to both focus initial research and also help identify potential issues early in the research. Finally, an end-to-end scenario created in this domain can be used to illustrate key capabilities resulting from the ensuing research.
5834868525ff05a97b00f0ce	The dominant species can reproduce in most months, the reproduction of rare species confine in few months, common species have more reproductive potential than other species. The dynamics and reproduction of rodents in same community show some extent diversity among dominant, common and rare species, for coexistence to use the resources in same habitat.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8ba	Proportional control of curvature of a flexible bevel-tipped needle can be accomplished by rotating the needle shaft with a duty cycle. Using this technique, an algorithm for image-guided path-following control in two dimensions, based on an autonomous vehicle controller, has been previously demonstrated. This paper describes a computationally simple algorithm that extends the path-following control to three dimensions. Results from simulation are presented.
5834868425ff05a97b00d188	In this paper, a user interface for the nanometer scale topology feedback is introduced. A 3-D Virtual Reality computer graphics display presents the topology of the nano world to the user, and a 1 Degree Of Freedom (DOF) haptic device used together with a 2-D conventional mouse enables a topology feedback from the nano world. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is used for the sensor of the nano world topology. This interface is the basic element of the Tele-Nanorobotics System and can be applied for its applications.
5834868425ff05a97b00d332	Large and growing opportunity costs are resulting from the inability to produce sophisticated, reliable software in a timely manner. Software engineering presents stubborn problems, but in this book, a group of experts suggest several constructive directions for research. Together, they support the need for greater interaction between researchers and practitioners and more aggressive efforts to share and reuse software engineering knowledge.
5834868425ff05a97b00cc8d	Security and privacy concerns touch on all aspects of pervasive computing, including hardware, operating systems, networks, databases, user interfaces, and applications. The seven articles selected for this special issue draw on ideas from many of these fields and provide a flavor of the kinds of security and privacy challenges and opportunities in pervasive computing. This article is part of a special issue on security and privacy.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3de	Plaid is a research programming language with a focus on typestate, permissions, and concurrency. Typestate describes ordering constraints on method calls to an object; Plaid incorporates typestate into both its object model and its type system. Permissions, incorporated into Plaid's type system and runtime, describe whether a reference can be aliased and whether aliases can change that reference. Permissions support static typestate checking, but they also allow Plaid's compiler to automatically parallelize Plaid code.
5834868425ff05a97b00e449	This paper describes our English Speech-to-Text (STT) system for the 2011 IWSLT ASR track. The system consists of 2 subsystems with different front-ends—one MVDR based, one MFCC based—which are combined using confusion network combination to provide a base for a second pass speaker adapted MVDR system. We demonstrate that this set-up produces competitive results on the IWSLT 2010 dev and test sets.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4db	Architectures are the structuring paradigms, styles and patterns that make up our software systems. They are important in many ways: they allow us to talk usefully about systems without talking about their detail; a knowledge of them gives us design choices; attention to this level can make systems and families of systems have the non-functional properties we want, especially changeability.
5834868425ff05a97b00c3b8	We describe novel but simple motion features for the problem of detecting objects in video sequences. Previous approaches either compute optical flow or temporal differences on video frame pairs with various assumptions about stabilization. We describe a combined approach that uses coarse-scale flow and fine-scale temporal difference features. Our approach performs weak motion stabilization by factoring out camera motion and coarse object motion while preserving nonrigid motions that serve as useful cues for recognition.
5834868425ff05a97b00c458	We demonstrate that winner selection in two prominent proportional representation voting systems is a computationally intractable problem—implying that these systems are impractical when the assembly is large. On a different note, in settings where the size of the assembly is constant, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time.
5834868425ff05a97b00c65d	In this paper we present an evaluation of Carmel-Tools, a novel behavior oriented approach to authoring and maintaining domain specific knowledge sources for robust sentence-level language understanding. Carmel-Tools provides a layer of abstraction between the author and the knowledge sources, freeing up the author to focus on the desired language processing behavior that is desired in the target system rather than the linguistic details of the knowledge sources that would make this behavior possible.
5834868425ff05a97b00c45f	Understanding the computational complexity of manipulation in elections is arguably the most central agenda in Computational Social Choice. One of the influential variations of the the problem involves a coalition of manipulators trying to make a favorite candidate win the election. Although the complexity of the problem is well-studied under the assumption that the voters are weighted, there were very few successful attempts to abandon this strong assumption.
5834868425ff05a97b00d1f8	The design of the Alphard programming language has been strongly influenced by ideas from the areas of programming methodology and formal program verification. The interaction of these ideas and their influence on Alpharc are described by developing a nontrivial example, a program for manipulating the parse tree of an arithmetic expression.
5834868425ff05a97b00d364	Alphard is a programming language whose goals include supporting both the development of well-structured programs and the formal verification of these programs. This paper attempts to capture the symbiotic influence of these two goals on the design of the language. To that end the language description is interleaved with the presentation of a proof technique and discussion of programming methodology. Examples to illustrate both the language and the verification technique are included.

5834868425ff05a97b00d4ee	Hardware design is carried out at several different levels, with different issues, models, and design strategies at each level. Thus circuits, registers, instruction sets, and architectures are designed in terms of different components combined with different operators; the analysis techniques (indeed, what is analyzed), notations, and appropriate tools are correspondingly different.
5834868425ff05a97b00c66e	We are developing a conversational agent called VIBRANT to provide adaptive support for brainstorming in pairs in a scientific inquiry context. Our previous experimental study indicated that although adaptive support was effective for learning, it did not mitigate the negative influence of social interaction on idea generation. In this paper, we present a process analysis that makes the effect of the adaptive support on the idea generation process more apparent and suggests directions for future work.

The method includes forming an opening through an etch layer and to a barrier layer, expanding the opening in the etch layer at the barrier layer, filling the opening with a material, removing the barrier layer from the material in the opening, and removing the etch layer from the material in the opening.

Software engineers and computer scientists can use this general architecture to create increasingly sophisticated conversational agents. We have developed agents based on Basilica that have been used in various application scenarios and foresee that agents build on Basilica can cater to a wider variety of interactive situations as we continue to add functionality to our architecture.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4bf	This paper describes a novel connectionist system for dialogue processing. Based on a script-like formalism, the system consists of several modular neural networks which can track the semantic flow of a dialogue. The system can be extended to understand and translate dialogues in a fixed domain.
5834868425ff05a97b00ccec	Kidney exchange provides a life-saving alternative to long waiting lists for patients in need of a new kidney. Fielded exchanges typically match under utilitarian or near-utilitarian rules; this approach marginalizes certain classes of patients. In this paper, we focus on improving access to kidneys for highly-sensitized, or hard-to-match, patients. Toward this end, we formally adapt a recently introduced measure of the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency---the price of fairness---to the standard kidney exchange model.
5834868425ff05a97b00c67f	In this paper we discuss how we apply discourse predictions along with non context-based predictions to the problem of parse disambiguation in Enthusiast, a Spanish-to-English translation system (Woszcyna et al., 1993; Suhm et al., 1994; Levin et al., 1995). We discuss extensions to our plan-based discourse processor in order to make this possible. We evaluate those extensions and demonstrate the advantage of exploiting context-based predictions over a purely non context-based approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00c67b	We introduce a novel topic segmentation approach that combines evidence of topic shifts from lexical cohesion with linguistic evidence such as syntactically distinct features of segment initial contributions. Our evaluation demonstrates that this hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when applied to loosely structured, spontaneous dialogue.
5834868425ff05a97b00c67e	In this paper, we explore using an intelligent dialogue tutor to influence student academic self-efficacy, as well as its interaction with group self-efficacy composition in a dyadic learning environment. We find providing additional tutor prompts encouraging students to participate in discussion may have unexpected negative effects on self-efficacy, especially on students with low self-efficacy scores who have partners with low self-efficacy scores.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5e6	A system and method for controlling the navigation of surface based vehicle uses a route that is obtained by manually driving the vehicle over the route to collect data defining the absolute position of the vehicle at various positions along the route. The collected data is smoothed to provide a consistent route to be followed. The smoothed data is subsequently used to automatically guide the vehicle over the route.
5834868425ff05a97b00c686	This paper describes key issues underlying the design of a tutoring system that brainstorms with students in order to support qualitative problem solving. Cognitively oriented and socially oriented support are enabled by two technologies, namely heuristic-based feedback generation and community-data-driven social recommendation. Formal representations and corresponding automated reasoning procedures for these technologies are introduced.
5834868425ff05a97b00c698	When testing a large number of hypothesis tests, the power to detect modest effects is often small due to the penalty one has to take for the number of tests when using traditional Bonferroni correction. The power increases somewhat when using the false discovery rate (FDR) but it is still challenging to find significant results when testing large numbers of hypotheses. The function presented in this abstract uses a weighted FDR (wFDR) approach in which prior information can be used to enhance power of the tests.
5834868425ff05a97b00c69c	The function produces a. txt file of the proper format that contains the input data and the adjaceny matrix. Because a common choice for the latter is MM', this is called the MM prime matrix by default. This file is loaded to the main fortran program to do eigenvalue decomposition. Alternatively, the output file can be created from an input file containing M by the fortran program located at http://wpicr. wpic. pitt. edu/WPICCompGen/MMp/MMp\\_page. htm.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6a2	In the version of this article initially published, there was an error in Table 1. Specifically, for rs5945326, the risk and non-risk alleles were reversed. The correct risk allele at rs5945326 is A, the non-risk allele is G and the risk allele frequency in HapMap CEU is 0.79. These errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the article.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6c7	The current study examined peer victimization and harsh parenting as longitudinal predictors of broadband and narrowband cognitions associated with the etiology of depression in children and adolescents. The sample consisted of 214 elementary and middle school students. At the start of the study, their average age was 12.2 years (SD= 1.0). The sex ratio was 112 girls to 102 boys. The sample was ethnically diverse (58.9% Caucasian, 34.1% African American, 10.7% Hispanic, 3.3% Asian, and 5.2% other).
5834868425ff05a97b00d204	A number of recent research efforts have been based on the hypothesis that encapsulation techniques, formal specification, and verification lead to significant improvements in program quality. As we gain experience with the language facilities produced by this research, we should attempt to validate that hypothesis. This paper poses this validation as the next major task in this area and outlines some ways to address it.
5834868425ff05a97b00d205	The Alphard language was desiQned to support the joint goals of facilitating contemporary programming methodology, encouraging formal specification of programs and verification of those specifications, allowing the programmer to exercise control over details that affect performance, and being able to compile compact, efficient code. This report presents the informal definition of the complete language.
5834868425ff05a97b00d207	The design of the Alphard language responded to concerns from several areas, including programming methodology, specification and verification, and object code efficiency. There is often tension among these concerns, with different concerns favoring different language decisions. This paper describes the interaction of the three concerns in the language design and in particular in the design of the iteration facility.
5834868525ff05a97b00efa1	The equivalence of three fast fixed order reeursive least squares (RLS] algorithms is shown. The FAEST and FTF algorithms are derived by eliminating redundancies in the fast Kalman algorithm. Exact equivalence is obtained by careful selection of the initial conditions. This equivalence suggests a new rescue variable which can perform no worse than previous ones and can test other symptoms of divergence as well.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6fe	Objective: To expand minimally invasive beating heart surgery, we have developed a miniature two-footed crawling robot (HeartLander) that navigates on the epicardium. For intrapericardial interventions, this paradigm obviates mechanical stabilization, lung deflation and access limitations. We tested the locomotion of the current prototype in vivo using a beating porcine heart accessed through a closed chest subxiphoid approach.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6a9	The package SAM targets at high dimensional predictive modeling (regression and classification) for complex data analysis. SAM is short for sparse additive modeling, and adopts the computationally efficient basis spline technique. We solve the optimization problems by various computational algorithms including the block coordinate descent algorithm, fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and newton method. The computation is further accelerated by warm-start and active-set tricks.
5834868425ff05a97b00d6b2	A relative pose between two cameras is determined by using input data obtained from the motion of subjects, such as pedestrians, between the fields of view of two cameras, determining trajectory information for the subjects, and computing homographies relating lines obtained from trajectories in the first image data to lines obtained from the trajectories in the second image data. The two fields of view need not overlap.
5834868425ff05a97b00d569	Conversation is like an intricate partner dance and behavioral convergence, or the similarity in observable behaviors of partners over time, can lead to shared understanding, changed beliefs and increased rapport. This article describes a synthesis of three strands of our work on fine-grained analysis of conversational interaction in peer tutoring at the paralinguistic and verbal levels, in an attempt to better understand the phenomenon of behavioral convergence and its relationship to social and cognitive constructs.
5834868425ff05a97b00d211	When this work was originally conceived in the early 1970s, the concepts associated with the phrase “structured programming” were less clearly perceived than they are now, and the notion of “abstract data type” did not exist. While it was generally recognized that methodological approaches to the solution of software problems had enormous potential, there was neither agreement on the methodology nor much experience on which to base belief in the potential.
5834868425ff05a97b00c716	A polygonal manipulator device for surgical interventions of the heart and other smooth organs is provided. A system implementing the device also is provided along with methods of use of the device and system. Methods of use of the device and system, such as for minimally-invasive cardiac intervention methods, are provided.
5834868425ff05a97b00c71b	This paper describes a technique to improve the locomotion of a miniature crawling robot,(Heart Lander) that uses suction to adhere to the surface of the beating heart. During locomotion, maintaining a vacuum seal with at least one of the suction pads is crucial. A new algorithm was developed to analyze data from pressure sensors monitoring the suction pads to accurately determine the suction status. HeartLander demonstrated successful locomotion on a realistic beating heart model when the algorithm was implemented.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd21	We introduce take-it-or-leave-it auctions (TLAs) as an allocation mechanism that allows buyers to retain much of their private valuation information as do the most common auction mechanisms (English and Dutch auctions), yet, unlike them, generates close-to-optimal expected utility for the seller. We show that if each buyer receives at most one offer, each buyer's dominant strategy is to act truthfully. In more general TLAs, the buyers' optimal strategies are more intricate, and we derive the perfect Bayesian equilibrium for the game.
5834868425ff05a97b00c72c	PURPOSE-The purpose of this research is to help those with pathological tremor use computer \ndevices like a mouse. Tremor patients are hindered from performing everyday tasks that many \nof us take for granted. Handwriting is among the most difficult of activities for many persons with \npathological tremor. Using computer devices such as a mouse/pen is also a difficult task. With \nthese two difficulties in mind, the goal then is to develop a computer assistive interface where \nhandwriting is aided as well as is general control over a computer mouse/pen.
5834868425ff05a97b00c495	We propose a first-order dynamic logic for reasoning about hybrid systems. As a uniform model for discrete and continuous evolutions in hybrid systems, we introduce hybrid programs with differential actions. Our logic can be used to specify and verify correctness statements about hybrid programs, which are suitable for symbolic processing by calculus rules. Using first-order variables, our logic supports systems with symbolic parameters. With dynamic modalities, it is prepared to handle multiple system components.
5834868425ff05a97b00c73b	Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of microns. To achieve these tasks, surgeons use tools of diameter 0.9 mm or less to access the eye's interior structures. The level of force required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile threshold, requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback. However, both of these methods can lead to tissue damage.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd2a	We choose the architecture that worked best for the baseline model using a validation set. All the experiments reported in the paper for this dataset use this network architecture. It consists of three convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by a max-pooling layer. The convolutional layers have 96, 128 and 256 filters respectively. Each convolutional layer has a 5× 5 receptive field applied with a stride of 1 pixel. Each max pooling layer pools 3× 3 regions at strides of 2 pixels.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4ca	In the area of parsing spontaneous speech, most work so far has primarily focused on dealing with texts within a narrow, well-de ned domain. The main reasons behind this restriction have been to avoid having to maintain very large and complex grammars on the one hand, and large semantic knowledge sources on the other hand.
5834868525ff05a97b00eb1d	Under the basis of analyzing and discussing the meanings of Blog and personal knowledge management, this article makes an elementary study on using Blog in teacher's personal knowledge management, mainly including: using Blog to digitize teacher's personal living event depiction and to construct teacher's personal repository, making collaboration in instruction design, enhancing teacher's personal knowledge exertion ability and sharing and creating knowledge by Blog.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf2c	The term “megaprogramming” was introduced by DARPA in 1990 to motivate the scaling up of software technology to very large systems of heterogeneous, distributed software components. The panelists will strive to make this term concrete, presenting complementary perspectives on different aspects of megaprogramming.
5834868425ff05a97b00d410	This paper deals with an automated path planning algorithm for a mobile robot in a structured enviornment. The algorithm is based upon finding all the largest (prime) free convex areas in the environment and representing this information in the form of a graph. A graph traversal algorithm which exploits back-tracking as well as dynamic cost allocation to graph arcs is presented and simulated. A strategy to trade of the optimality of the results for a smaller computation time is described.
5834868425ff05a97b00d412	This paper presents an outdoor mobile robot capable of high-speed navigation in outdoor environments. Here we consider the problem of a robot that has to follow a designated path at high speeds over undulating terrain. It must also be perceptive and agile enough to avoid small obstacles. Collision avoidance is a key problem and it is necessary to use sensing modalities that are able to operate robustly in a wide variety of conditions. We report on the sensing and control necessary for this application and the results obtained to date.
5834868425ff05a97b00d414	In results from urban and natural environments, we were able to successfully classify LZs from point cloud maps collected on a helicopter. The presented method enables detailed assessment of LZs without an landing approach, thereby improving safety. Still, the method assumes low-noise point cloud data. We intend to increase robustness to outliers while still detecting small obstacles in future work.
5834868425ff05a97b00c18b	We present an authorization logic that permits reasoning with explicit time. Following a prooftheoretic approach, we study the meta-theory of the logic, including cut elimination. We also demonstrate formal connections to proof-carrying authorization's existing approach for handling time and comment on the enforceability of our logic in the same framework. Finally, we illustrate the expressiveness of the logic through examples, including those with complex interactions between time, authorization, and mutable state.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1a9	Sequent calculi were conceived by Gentzen Gen35] primarily as a technical device for proving the consistency of logic and arithmetic. Their central property is cut elimination (Gentzen's Hauptsatz) which usually yields consistency as an easy corollary. Sequent calculi also form the basis for e cient proof search procedures, logic programming, and models of concurrent computation.
5834868425ff05a97b00c811	We present our ongoing work towards using the concept of transactivity [1] for automatically assessing learning of students working together in a collaborative setting. Transactive segments of student dialogue are proposed as useful components of conversation summaries generated for instructors. Experimental evaluation of this hypothesis shows promising results. Further, initial results are presented for automatic identification of transactive contributions in student dialogue.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1e2	GRADER is a computer program that can be used to maintain, compute, analyze, and print information about grades. It provides an efficient means of recording grades, and can save many precious end-ofsemester hours by quickly and accurately calculating, ordering, displaying, and printing grades, means and other statistics. It can also assign letter grades in accordance with the numerical intervals selected by the teacher, and print these grades with the names of the students.
5834868425ff05a97b00c835	An example actuator is provided to be used in robots and robotic devices. The actuator includes: a first plate, a second plate, and an elastic element disposed between the first plate and the second plate and including a center portion and an edge portion, the center portion corresponding to a first thickness and the edge portion corresponding to a second thickness larger than the first thickness, a first shear stress associated with the center portion being approximately equal to a second shear stress associated with the edge portion.
5834868425ff05a97b00c20f	Γ;∆,∆⇒ C (cutA) means that we do not have to consider this rule when searching for a proof. This is extremely important because it means we do not have to pluck arbitrary formulas A out of thin air to prove and then use as a lemma. All the remaining rules just decompose the connectives when the rules are viewed from the conclusion to the premises.
5834868425ff05a97b00c159	Every combination of top-level operator and sign occurs in one of the above cases. Tableau proof rules by those classes are shown in Figure 1. A tableau is closed if every branch contains some pair of formulas of the form σTA and σFA. A proof for modal logic formula consists of a closed tableau starting with the root 1FA.
5834868425ff05a97b00c217	A few notes on this grammar: we eliminated and 0, but added affine resources, marked with@ A to take their place. We will explain later why these are not present. We also eliminated positive atoms, which is mostly a historical omission. However, it turns out in our examples it is easily possible to get by without positive atoms, at the cost of additional focusing phases.
5834868425ff05a97b00c218	We start with a review of operations on numbers in binary representation in Celf. These are backward-chaining logic programs, but they will be helpful as subcomputations in our forward-chaining programs. First, the type declarations of natural numbers as a sequence of bits (represented by b0 and b1) and the increment predicate. We provide a mode declaration which states that the first argument to increment should be input and the second output. bit: type. b0: bit. b1: bit. nat: type. e: nat. d: nat-o bit-o nat.

5834868425ff05a97b00da97	As with prior Human Robot Interaction conferences, the 2010 conference hosted a video session. Submitted videos were peer reviewed on the importance of the lessons learned, novelty of the situation, and entertainment value. Out of the twenty-three submitted videos, twelve were accepted to this years' video session.
5834868425ff05a97b00e38a	Linear cellular automata have a canonical representation in terms of labeled de Bruijn graphs. We will show that these graphs, construed as semiautomata, provide a natural setting for the study of cellular automata. For example, we give a simple algorithm to determine reversibility and surjectivity of the global maps. We also comment on Wolfram's question about the growth rates of the minimal finite state machines associated with iterates of a cellular automaton.
5834868425ff05a97b00e38e	It is well known that the set of all natural numbers divisible by a fixed modulus m can be recognized by a finite state machine, assuming that the numbers are written in standard base-B representation. It is much harder to determine the state complexity of the minimal recognizer [1]. In this article we discuss the size of minimal recognizers for a variety of numeration systems, including reverse base-B representation and the Fibonacci system.
5834868425ff05a97b00e39c	We study the computational complexity of the evolution of configurations on finite and infinite cellular automata. We will show that a classification of cellular automata suggested by Culik and Yu and based on Wolfram's earlier heuristic classification leads to classes that are II 2 0-complete and is 3 0-complete.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3a0	Cellular automata have rich computational properties and, at the same time, provide plausible models of physics-like computation. We study decidability issues in the phasespace of these automata, construed as automatic structures over infinite words. In dimension one, slightly more than the first order theory is decidable but the addition of an orbit predicate results in undecidability. We comment on connections between this “what you see is what you get” model and the lack of natural intermediate degrees.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5e8	We present a policy-based error analysis approach that demonstrates a limitation to the current commonly adopted paradigm for sentence compression. We demonstrate that these limitations arise from the strong assumption of locality of the decision making process in the search for an acceptable derivation in this paradigm.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3a1	We discuss attempts at the classification of cellular automata, in particular with a view towards decidability. We will see that a large variety of properties relating to the short-term evolution of configurations are decidable in principle, but questions relating to the long-term evolution are typically undecidable. Even in the decidable case, computational hardness poses a major obstacle for the automatic analysis of cellular automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3a2	Finite additive cellular automata with fixed and periodic boundary conditions are considered as endomorphisms over pattern spaces. A characterization of the nilpotent and regular parts of these endomorphisms is given in terms of their minimal polynomials. Generalized eigenspace decomposition is determined and relevant cyclic subspaces are described in terms of symmetries. As an application, the lengths and frequencies of limit cycles in the transition diagram of the automaton are calculated.
5834868425ff05a97b00e1da	AI Magazine Volume 19 Number 2 (1998)(© AAAI) software components—agents. When interdependencies arise, the agents adaptively coordinate to handle them. The agent-based view could offer a powerful set of tools, techniques, and metaphors that has the potential to redefine the ways people interact with and build software. This prospect is exciting for us because it brings concepts and techniques developed by AI researchers into the forefront of software development.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5ea	Prior approaches to sentence compression have taken low level syntactic constraints into account in order to maintain grammaticality. We propose and successfully evaluate a more comprehensive, generalizable feature set that takes syntactic and structural relationships into account in order to sustain variable compression rates while making compressed sentences more coherent, grammatical and readable.
5834868425ff05a97b00e21c	In this paper, we outline a low cost multi-robot autonomous platform for a broad set of applications including water quality monitoring, flood disaster mitigation and depth buoy verification. By working cooperatively, fleets of vessels can cover large areas that would otherwise be impractical, time consuming and prohibitively expensive to traverse by a single vessel. We describe the hardware design, control infrastructure, and software architecture of the system, while additionally presenting experimental results from several field trials.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3a6	The classification of discrete dynamical systems that are computationally complete has recently drawn attention in light of Wolfram's “Principle of Computational Equivalence”. We discuss a classification for cellular automata that is based on computably enumerable degrees. In this setting the full structure of the semilattice of the ce degrees is inherited by the cellular automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00c239	We present a focused inverse method for proof search in a variety of intuitionistic modal logics such as K, D, T, S4 and S5. Unification of worldpaths for such logics is non-unitary and therefore handled by adding constraints to sequents. We sketch proofs of soundness and completeness with respect to intuitionistic modal natural deduction and describe our implementation. Potential applications lie in multi-modal intuitionistic logics that have recently been proposed to reason about authorization and information flow security.
5834868425ff05a97b00d85d	We propose a mathematical programming method to deal with uncertainty in the observations of a classification problem. This means that we can deal with situations where instead of a sample (xi, yi) we may only have a distribution over (xi, yi) at our disposition. In particular, we derive a robust formulation when the uncertainty is given by a normal distribution. This leads to Second Order Cone Programming Problems. Our method can be applied to the problem of missing data, where it outperforms direct imputation.

5834868425ff05a97b00d8b1	In this paper we present a hybrid cognitive system to support robot navigation. The system leverages the ACT-R cognitive architecture by integrating an external knowledge component for high-level reasoning. Methodological and implementation aspects are provided, together with an overview of the system's functionalities and the results of a preliminary simulation experiment.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8ef	Robotic tasks, particularly in the outdoor realm, have been largely limited to single-robot/single-goal scenarios [12.7][12.8][12.9] For mobile robotics to be effective in real-world applications, more than one robot must be able to share potentially unknown work spaces; also, complicated missions with interdependencies among these robots must be feasible.
5834868425ff05a97b00c203	Concurrent traces are sequences of computational steps where independent steps can be permuted and executed in any order. We study the problem of matching on concurrent traces. We outline a sound and complete algorithm for matching traces with one variable standing for an unknown subtrace.
5834868425ff05a97b00e23b	In various embodiments, a method for processing a user request is provided. The method may include receiving input data from a user including at least natural language associated with a user request; analyzing the user input data with an intermediary agent; selecting at least one form based on analyzing the user input data; and, executing at least one update based on at least one form.
5834868425ff05a97b00c5ed	Previous work suggests that student dispositional attributes have an effect on help-seeking behaviors. We report on studies attempting to apply this work to a computer-supported collaborative environment that suggest that dispositional attributes of motivation orientation and self-efficacy may be more easily examined in the context of task choices that follow failure events as part of an experimental design. Two studies that have lead to this conclusion are discussed, as well as plans for a recovery-from failure study in preparation.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3a8	We study the problem of assigning given failure probabilities to the nodes of a network so as to optimize its reliability. The measure used is the residual node connectedness reliability of the network, which is defined as the probability that the operating nodes are connected. In this paper, we show how optimal assignments can be found in polynomial time for paths, cycles, threshold graphs, and complete graphs minus a matching. On the other hand, the problem is shown to be NP-hard even for complete bipartite graphs.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8b1	There is a need for instrument motion sensing with sufficient accuracy for microsurgery. An instrument featuring six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) inertial sensing of intraoperative motion has been developed. With rms noise of 7.8 mm/s/sup 2/and 1.1 mdeg/s and bandwidth over 20 Hz, it is capable of capturing both gross motion and microscopic movements, eg, hand tremor. Preliminary results are presented.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3ad	We describe automata, a package based on Mathematica, that implements algorithms to generate and manipulate finite state machines and their syntactic semigroups. The programs have been used in teaching automata theory. We also discuss applications of the automata machinery to research on cellular automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00d093	Diagnosing performance problems in modern datacenters and distributed systems is challenging, as the root cause could be contained in any one of the system's numerous components or, worse, could be a result of interactions among them. As distributed systems continue to increase in complexity, diagnosis tasks will only become more challenging. There is a need for a new class of diagnosis techniques capable of helping developers address problems in these distributed environments.
5834868425ff05a97b00e24c	Current publish/subscribe systems offer a range of expressive subscription languages for constraints. However, classical systems restrict the publish operation to be a single published object that contains only constants and no constraints. We introduce symmetric publish/subscribe, a novel generalization of publish/subscribe where both publications and subscriptions contain constraints in addition to constants. Published objects are matched to subscriptions by computing the intersection of their constraints.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3b0	We study the sizes of minimal finite state machines associated with linear cellular automata. In particular, we construct a class of binary linear cellular automata whose corresponding minimal automata exhibit full exponential blow-up. These cellular automata have Hamming distance 1 to a permutation automaton. Moreover, the corresponding minimal Fischer automata as well as the minimal DFAs have maximal complexity. By contrast, the complexity of higher iterates of a cellular automaton always stays below the theoretical upper bound.
5834868425ff05a97b00c301	We report on work in progress regarding a foundation for the notion of meta-variable in logical frameworks and type theories. Our proposal is to treat meta-variables as modal variables in a modal type theory, which is logically clean and justifies several low-level implementation techniques for meta-variables. We also speculate on other logical extensions of our modal type theory, at present without clear applications.

In particular, the statement “If the diameter of the graph is two then vertices can only be colored by an agent i∈ N at time 1 or 2”, which appears in the theorem's proof, is false. Takehara et al. in fact provide an explicit counterexample to the theorem. The following is a correct statement of the theorem. Theorem 2.1. Let G be a graph and let N={1,..., n} such that D (G′)≤ 2 for every G′ that is obtained from G by removing n− 1 vertices along with their neighbors.

This coordination comprises two processes: the physical process of moving to get close enough to transfer the object, and the cognitive process of exchanging information to guide the transfer. Despite this complexity, we humans are capable of performing handovers seamlessly in a wide variety of situations, even when unexpected. This suggests a common procedure that guides all handover interactions.
5834868425ff05a97b00e375	Consider how one might describe the sequences of atomic actions IF] performable by a standard deterministic flowchart scheme F. One can exhibit F as a finite directed graph whose vertices are labeled with letters in a ranked alphabet~ 2 (if the vertex v has outdegree k, then the letter labeling v is in the set~ k). Then we say that the set [F] is the set of all labels of paths in F from the'begin vertex'to the exit. If one wants to refine this notion further, one can associate a labeled tree with F, the so called'unfolding'of F, and define [F] as this tree.

5834868425ff05a97b00d0b2	We present a close relationship between Expectation-Maximization algorithm and direct optimization approaches such as gradient-based methods for parameter learning. We show that the step EM takes in the parameter space and true gradient are related by the symmetric positive definite P matrix, and provide an explicit form of this matrix for several widely used latent variable models. We then go on deriving a general form of the P matrix for the regular exponential family in terms of its natural parameters.

Subjects attempted to hold a microsurgical instrument still for 30 s and its 3-D tip position was recorded. RMS error, overall motion range were calculated and spectral analysis was performed for each axis. The RMS error was between 54/spl mu/m and 118/spl mu/m and the overall range of motion was between 239/spl mu/m and 588/spl mu/m, depending on the axis. Substantial low frequency motion was present.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8ec	We present a novel application of a neural network to augment manual precision by cancelling involuntary motion. This method may be applied in microsurgery, using either a telerobotic approach or active compensation in a handheld instrument. A feedforward neural network is trained to input the measured trajectory of a handheld tool tip and output the intended trajectory. Use of the neural network decreases rms error in recordings from four subjects by an average of 43.9%.

While no machine built today realizes the union of these attributes, several robots demonstrate one or more of them. The Cornell biped is designed to be highly energy efficient.
5834868425ff05a97b00de67	This paper addresses the problem of exponentially stabilizing periodic orbits in a special class of hybrid models-systems with impulse effects-through control Lyapunov functions. The periodic orbit is assumed to lie in a C 1 submanifold Z that is contained in the zero set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous and discrete dynamics; the associated restriction dynamics are termed the hybrid zero dynamics. The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable within the hybrid zero dynamics.

We aim to understand the control of human locomotion, develop neuromuscular control models that generate robust 3D locomotion, and transfer the resulting controllers to humanoid and rehabilitation robotics.
5834868425ff05a97b00c419	Scoring rules are a broad and concisely-representable class of voting rules which includes, for example, Plurality and Borda. Our main result asserts that the class of scoring rules, as functions from preferences into candidates, is efficiently learnable in the PAC model. We discuss the applications of this result to automated design of scoring rules. We also investigate possible extensions of our approach, and (along the way) we establish a lemma of independent interest regarding the number of distinct scoring rules.

5834868425ff05a97b00dec2	In this paper we present a new algorithm suitable for matching discrete objects such as strings and trees in linear time, thus obviating dynarrtic programming with quadratic time complexity. Furthermore, prediction cost in many cases can be reduced to linear cost in the length of the sequence to be classified, regardless of the number of support vectors. This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner.
5834868425ff05a97b00c366	A method of virtualizing reality, ie, a method of creating virtual reality from images of a real event, is comprised of the steps of capturing a plurality of images of each time instant of a real event using a plurality of cameras positioned at a plurality of angles. Each image is stored as intensity and/or color information. A suitable internal representation is computed from these images and the information regarding the camera angles. An image of each time instant may be generated from any viewing angle using the internal representation of it.
5834868425ff05a97b00dee5	We present a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and semantic dependencies. It learns a representation of the entire algorithm state, using stack long short-term memories. Our greedy inference algorithm has linear time, including feature extraction. On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that jointly learn syntax and semantics.

The Virtualized Reality world model consists of real images and depth information computed from these images. Stereoscopic reconstructions provide a sense of complete immersion, and users can select their own viewpoints at view time, independent of the actual camera positions used to capture the event.
5834868425ff05a97b00e2b7	The Graspables project is an exploration of how measuring the way people hold and manipulate objects can be used as a user interface. As computational power continues to implemented in more and more objects and devices, new interaction methods need to be developed. The Graspables System is embodied by a physical set of sensors combined with pattern recognition software that can determine how users hold a device. The Graspables System has been implemented in two prototypes, the Bar of Soap and the Ball of Soap.

A nonlinear control law is introduced which drives the needle to track a predetermined planar path using a steering approach based on duty-cycled rotation during insertion. Renal access is performed in simulation and tested in vitro in a tissue phantom to validate the proposed control method.
5834868425ff05a97b00e2ef	This paper describes a prototype system for reasoning about trust. The system takes as input a set of statements in logic, each attributed to an agent, and a social network that indicates what trust relations hold between the agents. Given a query in the form of a proposition, and an agent that is interested in that query, the system returns a graph containing all arguments that have the proposition as its conclusion and all the arguments that bear on the acceptability of the conclusion.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8fa	This paper presents the first prototype of an active hand-held instrument to sense and compensate physiological tremor and other unwanted movement during vitreoretinal microsurgery. The instrument incorporates six inertial sensors (three accelerometers and three rate gyros) to detect motion of the handle. The movement of the instrument tip in three dimensions is then obtained using appropriate kinematic calculations. The motion captured is processed to discriminate between desired and undesired components of motion.
5834868425ff05a97b00c609	We discuss an interactive approach to robust interpretation in a large scale speech-to-speech translation system. Where other interactive approaches to robust interpretation have depended upon domain dependent repair rules, the approach described here operates efficiently without any such hand-coded repair knowledge and yields a 37% reduction in error rate over a corpus of noisy sentences.

We provide an efficient algorithm, Voxel Depth Carving (a variant of Occupancy Grid Mapping) which accomplishes this goal. Real-world experiments with lasers, RGB-D cameras, and simulated sensors in both 2D and 3D verify the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison to traditional point-cloud based methods.

To represent object relationship statistics beyond adjacent pixels, prior work either represents only weak spatial information using the segmented regions, or encodes only global object co-occurrences. In this paper, we propose a unified...
5834868425ff05a97b00c4fb	A linear syntax for natural deduction proofs in first-order intuitionistic logic is presented, which has been an effective tool for teaching logic. The proof checking algorithm is also given, which is the core of the tutorial proof checker Tutch. This syntax is then extended to proofs on the assertion level which resemble single inferences one would make in a rigorous proof. The resulting language has only four constructs. Checking of these proofs is decidable, and an efficient algorithm is given.
5834868425ff05a97b00df10	Large networks of human and machine systems have staggeringly complex properties which make them difficult to analyze. This resistance to characterization is due to the fact that the number of possible interactions between the system nodes is exponential in the number of nodes. This combinatorial complexity makes such systems resistant to both formal analysis and empirical exploration. The goal of this work is to analyze a particular complex system, a system of agents that fuse information to develop shared beliefs.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb33	The design and implementation of the network architecture (hardware, software, and protocols) of the RAID-II system are described. RAID-II is a high-speed file server connected to an UltraNetwork. To support high bandwidth network transfers with the RAID-II server, the networking software is divided among the various processors in the system. With the distributed software, the CPU still limits the RAID-II file server to 21 Mbyte/s of data bandwidth on the authors' network.
5834868425ff05a97b00c516	Presents new proofs of cut elimination for intuitionistic, classical and linear sequent calculi. In all cases, the proofs proceed by three nested structural inductions, avoiding the explicit use of multi-sets and termination measures on sequent derivations. This makes them amenable to elegant and concise implementations in Elf, a constraint logic programming language based on the LF logical framework.
5834868425ff05a97b00c518	We investigate the problem of translating between different styles of proof systems in higherorder logic: analytic proofs which are well suited for automated theorem proving, and nonanalytic deductions which are well suited for the mathematician. Analytic proofs are represented as expansion proofs, H, a form of the sequent calculus we define, non-analytic proofs are represented by natural deductions. A non-deterministic translation algorithm between expansion proofs and H-deductions is presented and its correctness is proven.
5834868425ff05a97b00c51d	We propose a refinement of the type theory underlying the LF logical framework by a form of subtypes and intersection types. This refinement preserves desirable features of LF, such as decidability of type-checking, and at the same time considerably simplifies the representations of many deductive systems. A subtheory can be applied directly to hereditary Harrop formulas which form the basis of λProlog and Isabelle.
5834868425ff05a97b00df21	We present an approach known as Profit-sharing that allows agents to learn effective behaviors within dynamic and multiagent environments, where the agents are competitive and may have to face resource conflicts, perceptual aliasing and uncertainty of other agents' intentions. A dynamic domain based on a NEO (non-combatant evacuation operation) is described.

These include the profile likelihood, least favourable families and methods based on the Kullback-Leibler distance function. The authors demonstrate tht at least in a neighborhood of the maximum likelihood estimate, these are equivalent for the exponential family. Keywords: Nuisance parameters.
5834868425ff05a97b00c60e	Supervised learning involves collecting unlabeled data, defining features to represent an instance, obtaining annotations for the unlabeled instances, and learning a classifier from the annotated data. Each of these steps has an associated cost. In this thesis, our goal is to reduce the total cost for the desired performance in supervised learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing the cost of feature engineering and the total annotation cost.

5834868425ff05a97b00d100	Inspired by recent work in machine translation and object detection, we introduce an attention based model that automatically learns to describe the content of images. We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence.
5834868425ff05a97b00c616	Automatic assessment of group processes in collaborative groups is one of the holy grails of the computer supported collaborative learning community. In this paper, we present work towards detecting one type of group process which provides an important window into the inner workings of a group, namely “idea co-construction (ICC)”. What is unique about our approach in relation to other educational data mining techniques is that we adopt insights from sociolinguistic theories by modeling stylistic convergence of speech.

To simplify this process, we have constructed a languageindependent canonicalized model for programming solutions. This model allows for much greater overlap across different students than a basic text model, which enables more self-sustaining hint generation methods in programming tutors.

Hala answers questions in Arabic and English about people, locations of offices, classrooms and other rooms in the building. She also provides information about the weather, Education City, and her personal life.
5834868425ff05a97b00e41b	We report on techniques for using discourse context to reduce ambiguity and improve translation accuracy in a multi-lingual (Spanish, German, and English) spoken language translation system.

5834868425ff05a97b00c58d	In this paper we discuss issues related to speeding up parsing with wide-coverage unification grammars. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art optimisation techniques based on backbone parsing before unification do not provide a general solution, because they depend on specific properties of the grammar formalism that do not hold for all unification based grammars. As an alternative, we describe an optimisation technique that combines ambiguity packing at the constituent structure level with pruning based on local features.

METHODS: The HFESCs were isolated by means of type IV collagen rapid adhering method. The culture medium for HFESCs was prepared according to that for human fetal fibroblasts. The cultured cells were identified by immunohistochemistry staining of keratin-19 and integrin-beta1, cell cycle analysis and clone forming rate determination.

However, the nature of th e University imposes an additional obligation to evaluate th e performance of each student and to report his mastery of th e material via a grade. A variety of pressures divert students' attention from the knowledge to the grades; occasionally thi s leads to attempts to obtain grades by cheating instead of learning.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbc4	The program included three three-hour invited symposia: the first, on Frege's Contribution to Logic, was organized by Michael Kremer; the second, on The Philosophy of Proof Theory, was organized by Timothy Bays; and the third, on Category Theory and Structuralism, was organized by Steve Awodey. Each of the symposia consisted of two hour-long talks and commentary as follows.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbbc	The Knaster-Tarski Fixed-Point Theorem applies to monotone self-maps of a powerset, giving the existence of minimal and maximal fixed points. An analogy in Category Theory gives—for certain categories and certain functors—the existence of initial algebras and final coalgebras. For some interesting kinds of functors, this categorical construction can be reduced back to powersets and monotone functions. Applications include the construction of some new lambda-calculus models based on initial algebras and final coalgebras.
5834868425ff05a97b00cbd6	It is shown how the operators in the “graph model” for λ-calculus (which can function as a programming language for Recursive Function Theory) can be expanded to allow for “random combinators”. The result then is a model for a new language for random algorithms.
5834868525ff05a97b00e864	A method for synthesizing high-content NaY molecular sieves with kaolin sprayed microspheres includes adding functional components and deionized water into kaolin so as to be pulped into a mixed slurry. The slurry is sprayed into microspheres. The microspheres are calcined at a temperature between 700 and 1,000° C. and mixed with a directing agent for crystallization. The resultant solid is filtrated and washed with water and then dried to obtain a final in-situ crystallized product with high content of molecular sieves.
5834868525ff05a97b00ea18	By laboratory and field experiments the oversummering of the preying mite (Phytaseiulus, persimilis, pp) was studied. the results showed that the pp population decreased abruptly from early June to mid July when the average temperature was from 29℃ to 31℃. And it decreased by 73.4% in laboratory and 66.8% in field when the average temperature was over 32℃≥ during the second half of July and August. Therefore, it is necessary to select the hot resistant strain of pp.
5834868425ff05a97b00d134	Politeness is believed to facilitate communication in human interaction, as it can minimize the potential for conflict and confrontation. Regarding the role of politeness strategies for human-robot interaction, conflicting findings are presented in the literature. Thus, we conducted a between-participants experimental study with a receptionist robot to gain a deeper understanding of how politeness on the one hand, and the type of interaction itself on the other hand, might affect and shape user experience and evaluation of HRI.
5834868425ff05a97b00e42c	We propose a method for compensating distortions in the speech signal caused by environment changes. The basic method concentrates on additive noise, but can be extended to address also channel and to some extent speaker changes. By combining compensation with adaptation techniques it leads to high error rate reductions for mobile speech applications. Thereby, it is more efficient than adapting the acoustic model of the recognizer and more powerful than simple noise reduction techniques.

5834868425ff05a97b00e39f	We study the disjunctive binary sequence introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski in [1]. The match length associated to the bits of the sequence is shown to be a crucial tool in the analysis of the sequence. We show that the match length between two consecutive bits in the sequence differs at most by 1 and give a lower bound for the limiting density of the sequence. Experimental computation in the automata package has been very helpful in developing these results.
5834868425ff05a97b00d775	We investigate a divide-and-conquer technique in multidimensional space which decomposes a geometric problem on N points in k dimensions into two problems on N/2 points in k dimensions plus a single problem on N points in k-1 dimension. Special structure of the subproblems is exploited to obtain an algorithm for finding the two closest of N points in O (N log N) time in any dimension. Related results are discussed, along with some conjectures and unsolved geometric problems.

A first-person account of the development of geometric algorithms at the Yale University Department of Computer Science and Carnegie Mellon University during 1972-1978 by one of the architects of computational geometry through his interactions with other researchers such as Dan Hoey, Stanley Eisenstat, HR Strong, Gideon Yuval and Jon Bentley. Computational geometry (CG) as a discipline is now a quarter-century old and has given rise to several entire journals, scores of conferences and thousands of publications.

Frinally employing Hoeffding's Theorem allows us to bound the three probabilities as e− 2mt2 α2 2, e− 2mt2 β2 4, and e− 2mt2 (1− α− β) 2 3,(4) Setting the argument of all three exponentials equal yields α> 0.28: consequently, the positive deviation probability is bounded from above by 3e− mt2α2. Similarly, the negative deviation probability is also bounded by 3e− mt2α2.
5834868425ff05a97b00d849	Recently the so called Fisher kernel was proposed by 6] to construct discriminative kernel techniques by using generative models. We provide a regularization-theoretic analysis of this approach and extend the set of kernels to a class of natural kernels, all based on generative models with density p (xj), like the original Fisher kernel. This allows us to incorporate distribution dependent smoothness criteria in a general way. As a result of this analyis we show that the Fisher kernel corresponds to a L2 (p) norm regularization.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc4b	The authors describe a system that automates a continuous miner, enabling it to maneuver in highly constrained environments and cut coal without a human operator onboard. The system consists of a modified continuous miner, a laser range sensor, a SPARCstation, and control software. To date, the system has been tested on a mobile robot and on a continuous miner both above ground and in a real coal mine. The authors note that this system is the first instance of an intelligent robotic system for cutting coal.

The system consists of a phrase-based translation system using a pre-reordering approach. The baseline system already includes several models like conventional language models on different word factors and a discriminative word lexicon. This system is used to generate a k-best list. In a second step, the list is reranked using SOUL language and translation models (Le et al., 2011).
5834868425ff05a97b00ce04	User-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) is critical in Internet video applications as it impacts revenues for content providers and delivery systems. Given that there is little support in the network for optimizing such measures, bottlenecks could occur anywhere in the delivery system. Consequently, a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players is critical to ensure good user experience. Previous studies have shown key limitations of state-of-art commercial solutions and proposed a range of heuristic fixes.
5834868425ff05a97b00d233	The majority of current water strider robots are limited by their ability to jump on the water surface. In order to address this problem, innovative mechanical design can be used. A potential solution is the combination of hydrophobic pads and a spring-based launching device. Incorporating this design would increase the maneuverability of water surface robots. This paper discusses the progress in prototyping and modeling the water strider system.
5834868425ff05a97b00c636	We explore the utility of a computational framework for social authority in dialogue, codified as utterance-level annotations. We first use these annotations at a macro level, compiling aggregate statistics and showing that the resulting features are predictive of group performance in a task-based dialogue. Then, at a micro level, we introduce the notion of an interaction pattern, a formulation of speaker interactions over multiple turns. We use these patterns to characterize situations where speakers do not share information equally.
5834868425ff05a97b00d16e	The authors propose to the Carnegie-Mellon Computer Science Department a curriculum for undergraduate computer science. This report sets forth objectives for computer science education, presents an overview of the content of a curriculum, defines die course structure for a degrcee program, and outlines a set of courses. The curriculum design is intended to anticipate the content that will be appropriate at the end of this decade. We have tried to avoid being unduly prejudiced by traditional courses and organizations.
5834868425ff05a97b00c192	The addition of proof irrelevant types to LF permits more expressive encodings and a richer (but still decidable) definitional equality. These types can also be used to maintain invariants concerning the interchangeability of subproofs of large proofs, which can be useful for proof compression for proof-carrying code. We investigate the metatheoretic properties of this language extension and reconcile it with the notion of strictness, a property of notational definitions which can improve implementation efficiency of proofchecking.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1a1	We derive a family of algorithms around the theme of higher-order uniﬁcation. The main derivation starts with a concise, abstract speciﬁcation and ends with a version of Huet's algorithm for higher-order uniﬁcation. Next we derive some very useful high-level optimizations. Finally, we describe how to extend the algorithm to give a complete treatment of products and an incomplete but very useful treatment of polymorphisrn, yielding a new and signiﬁcantly more powerful algorithm (which we have implemented).
5834868425ff05a97b00cf31	For the average person, the Internet is still too hard to use. We report evidence from HomeNet, a field trial in Pittsburgh that tries to understand how people use the Internet. Despite our reducing technological and economic barriers to use, families had problems connecting and using the Internet. We show that help calls, however, are not a good indicator of usability, since it is the “enthusiasts” and people with instrumental tasks to accomplish who call.
5834868425ff05a97b00e396	We describe a class of simple transitive semiautomata that exhibit full exponential blow-up during deterministic simulation. For arbitrary semiautomata we show that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether the size of the accessible part of their power automata exceeds a given bound. We comment on the application of these results to the study of cellular automata.

Following this direction it seems almost inevitable that some types need to be carried at runtime. A second possibility is to introduce type variables and think of the type of constructors as schematic in their free type variables. list: type.[]: list.'.': A, list-> list.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1c7	ETPS (Educational Theorem Proving System) is a program which logic students can use to write formal proofs in first-order logic or higher-order logic. It enables students to concentrate on the essential logical problems involved in proving theorems, and automatically checks the proofs.
5834868425ff05a97b00d3e3	The requirement to operate aircraft in GPS-denied environments can be met by using visual odometry. Aiming at a full-scale aircraft equipped with a high-accuracy inertial navigation system (INS), the proposed method combines vision and the INS for odometry estimation. With such an INS, the aircraft orientation is accurate with low drift, but it contains high-frequency noise that can affect the vehicle motion estimation, causing position estimation to drift. Our method takes the INS orientation as input and estimates translation.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc49	We describe a heuristic search algorithm for generating optimal plans in a new class of decision problem, characterised by the incorporation of hidden state. The approach exploits the nature of the hidden state to reduce the state space by orders of magnitude. It then interleaves heuristic expansion of the reduced space with forwards and backwards propagation phases to produce a solution in a fraction of the time required by other techniques. Results are provided on an outdoor path planning application.
5834868425ff05a97b00c65f	Multi-Domain learning assumes that a single metadata attribute is used in order to divide the data into so-called domains. However, real-world datasets often have multiple metadata attributes that can divide the data into domains. It is not always apparent which single attribute will lead to the best domains, and more than one attribute might impact classification. We propose extensions to two multi-domain learning techniques for our multi-attribute setting, enabling them to simultaneously learn from several metadata attributes.
5834868425ff05a97b00c1fe	We present the design of L10, a rich forward-chaining (aka “bottom-up”) logic programming language. L10 allows parallel computation to be explicitly specified through the use of worlds, a logically-motivated concept that has been used to describe distributed functional programming. An interpreter for L10 runs these logic programs on top of the infrastructure of the X10 programming language, and is responsible for mapping between L10's worlds and places, the related X10 construct for describing distributed computation.
5834868425ff05a97b00ded8	A new method for performing a nonlinear form of Principal Component Analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in highdimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map; for instance the space of all possible d-pixel products in images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.
5834868425ff05a97b00ded9	A new regression technique based on Vapnik's concept of support vectors is introduced. We compare support vector regression (SVR) with a committee regression technique (bagging) based on regression trees and ridge regression done in feature space. On the basis of these experiments, it is expected that SVR will have advantages in high dimensionality space because SVR optimization does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space.
5834868425ff05a97b00c402	Consider the unit circle S1 with distance function d measured along the circle. We show that for every selection of 2n points x1,…, xn, y1,…, yn∈ S1 there exists i∈{1,…, n} such that∑ k= 1nd (xi, xk)≤∑ k= 1nd (xi, yk). We also discuss a game theoretic interpretation of this result.
5834868425ff05a97b00dedd	Suppose you are given some data set drawn from an underlying probability distribution P and you want to estimate a “simple” subset S of input space such that the probability that a test point drawn from P lies outside of S equals some a priori specified value between 0 and 1.
5834868425ff05a97b00dede	In this tutorial we give an overview of the basic ideas underlying Support Vector (SV) machines for function estimation. Furthermore, we include a summary of currently used algorithms for training SV machines, covering both the quadratic (or convex) programming part and advanced methods for dealing with large datasets. Finally, we mention some modifications and extensions that have been applied to the standard SV algorithm, and discuss the aspect of regularization from a SV perspective.
5834868425ff05a97b00dedf	A new method for performing a nonlinear form of principal component analysis is proposed. By the use of integral operator kernel functions, one can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces, related to input space by some nonlinear map—for instance, the space of all possible five-pixel products in 16× 16 images. We give the derivation of the method and present experimental results on polynomial feature extraction for pattern recognition.
5834868425ff05a97b00cafe	In some urban transit systems, passengers are legally required to purchase tickets before entering but are not physically forced to do so. Instead, patrol units move about through the transit system, inspecting tickets of passengers, who face fines for fare evasion. This setting yields the problem of computing optimal patrol strategies satisfying certain temporal and spacial constraints, to deter fare evasion and hence maximize revenue. In this paper we propose an initial model of this problem as a leader-follower Stackelberg game.
5834868425ff05a97b00def3	Our work has studied software developers with traditional backgrounds in distributed settings. In the future, projects will involve even more diverse sets of individuals, especially if the goal is to eventually include end-users in the development process. However, there exists a computational, and necessarily economic, divide. End-users come from different disciplines and socio-economic backgrounds. As such, they have unequal access to social and technical resources.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb01	We study how to learn to play a Pareto-optimal strict Nash equilibrium when there exist multiple equilibria and agents may have different preferences among the equilibria. We focus on repeated coordination games of non-identical interest where agents do not know the game structure up front and receive noisy payoffs. We design efficient near-optimal algorithms for both the perfect monitoring and the imperfect monitoring setting (where the agents only observe their own payoffs and the joint actions).
5834868425ff05a97b00c4df	We present new proofs of cut elimination for intuitionistic and classical sequent calculi. In both cases the proofs proceed by three nested structural inductions, avoiding the explicit use of multi-sets and termination measures on sequent derivations. This makes them amenable to elegant and concise representations in LF, which are given in full detail.
5834868425ff05a97b00c87c	Summary. Inferences in measurement error models can be sensitive to modeling assumptions. Specifically, if the model is incorrect, the estimates can be inconsistent. To reduce sensitivity to modeling assumptions and yet still retain the efficiency of parametric inference, we propose using flexible parametric models that can accommodate departures from standard parametric models. We use mixtures of normals for this purpose. We study two cases in detail: a linear errors-in-variables model and a change-point Berkson model.
5834868425ff05a97b00d497	Abstract—The goal of the CMU Planetary Rover project is to prototype an autonomous mobile robot for planetary exploration. We have constructed a six-legged walking robot, called the Ambler, that features orthogonal legs, an overlapping gait, and a scanning laser rangeﬁnder to model terrain. To enable the Ambler to walk over rugged terrain, we have combined perception, planning, and real-time control into a comprehensive robotic system.

It shows that the Orysan sativa contains flavonoids, organic acids, lactones, coumarins, cardiac glycosides and saponins. This experiment will be the basis of study and development of the medical component of Orysan sativa.

5834868425ff05a97b00d49a	The authors quantify several performance metrics for the Ambler, a six-legged robot configured for autonomous traversal of Mars-like terrain. They present power consumption measures for walking on sandy terrain and for vertical lifts at different velocities. They document the accuracy of a novel dead reckoning approach, and analyze the accuracy. They describe the results of autonomous walking experiments in terms of terrain traversed, walking speed, number of instructions executed and endurance.

5834868425ff05a97b00cb69	A network employing multiple redundancy-aware routers that can eliminate the transmission of redundant data is greatly improved by steering redundant data preferentially into common data paths possibly contrary to other routing paradigms. By collecting redundant data in certain pathways, the effectiveness of the redundancy-aware routers is substantially increased.
5834868425ff05a97b00d657	While many multi-robot systems rely on fortuitous cooperation between agents, some tasks, such as the assembly of large structures, require tighter coordination. We present a general software architecture for coordinating heterogeneous robots that allows for both autonomy of the individual agents as well as explicit coordination. This paper presents recent results with three robots with very different configurations. Working as a team, these robots are able to per-form a high-precision docking task that none could achieve individually.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6fd	Hand tremor represents a significant problem in microsurgical applications, since high levels of accuracy are required for these procedures. Therefore various methods of tremor cancellation are an important area of study. The system investigated in this paper is the handheld tremor canceling system-Micron. An error analysis of the application of stereo vision based sensing for controlling the Micron instrument is presented.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7e7	We present the results of a study in which we contrast alternative forms of collaborative learning support in the midst of a collaborative design task in which students negotiate between increasing power and increasing environmental friendliness. In this context, we evaluated the instructional effectiveness of four alternative support conditions as well as a goal manipulation. Both manipulations yield surprising findings, which we are continuing to investigate.
5834868425ff05a97b00e361	In Retsina, the authors have developed a distributed collection of software agents that cooperate asynchronously to perform goal-directed information retrieval and integration for supporting a variety of decision-making tasks. Examples for everyday organizational decision making and financial portfolio management demonstrate its effectiveness.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4b6	We have previously presented a new one parameter family of algorithms and a program for evaluating the first m derivatives of a polynomial of degree n. In this paper we analyze that family of algorithms and present practical algorithms for selecting optimal or good values of the parameter q. A program for selecting the optimal value of q under the constraint that q divides n+ 1 is given. We also analyze a program that eliminates that constraint and a simple program that selects a good, but not always optimal, value of q.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4b7	The Alphard language was designed to support the joint goals of facilitating contemporary programming methodology, encouraging formal specification of programs and verification of those specifications, allowing the programmer to exercise control over details that affect performance, and being able to compile compact, efficient code. This report presents the informal definition of the Complete language.
5834868425ff05a97b00d74d	Software's increasingly critical role in systems of widespread significance presents new challenges for the education of software engineers. Not only is our dependence on software increasing, but the character of software production is itself changing-and with it the demands on the software developers. Four challenges for educators of software developers help identify aspirations for software engineering education.
5834868425ff05a97b00c6fc	A compact system for high-resolution three-dimensional measurement of microsurgical instrument tip position in the laboratory is under development. The system is useful for quantification of tremor, wander, and drift, as well as for other studies characterizing surgeons' motion in microsurgery, and forevaluation of engineered devices for enhancement of microsurgical positioning accuracy. Preliminary results are presented.
5834868425ff05a97b00e099	Enabling computational agents to efficiently aid or automate negotiations with humans requires a recognition and understanding of differences in negotiation behavior. One important dimension of these differences is based on the cultures of the negotiators. In this work, we investigate two tasks needed to enable culturally-sensitive computational negotiation agents:(1) the identification of negotiators' cultures from observed negotiation transcripts, and (2) the prediction of culturally-based differences in negotiation outcomes.
5834868425ff05a97b00c700	HeartLander is a small, mobile robot designed to assist surgical procedures on the surface of the heart. It crawls within the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. Numerous potential clinical uses for HeartLander involve injections or other interventions at multiple locations on the epicardial surface. To minimize treatment time, we have developed an algorithm that optimizes a plan for reaching a given set of treatment targets. Results from in vitro evaluation on a beating heart model show improvement over a greedy technique.
5834868425ff05a97b00c705	A voltage-current converter is described having a quasi-complementary class-AB architecture that is particularly suited to implementation using discrete power MOSFETs. High-voltage mirror designs are presented, enabling the construction of sources with kilovolt compliance range, tens of watts of output power and greater than 100 kHz bandwidth. GΩ output impedance and distortion below 1% can be obtained with no trimming or transistor matching.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0b0	If you are going to design and develop a software agent-based real application system for electronic commerce, you would immediately learn that there exists no such secure communication between agents, which is assumed by most agent model designers. In fact, software agents, as primarily human-delegated software entities, would face almost all the risk and security threats, which human being have to face (Schneier, 1996), especially in commercial activities.
5834868425ff05a97b00c943	Education boards and ministries across the world are realizing the importance of computing education in K-12 as evidenced by changes to grade school curriculum in several countries. Department of Education in UK, recently introduced a new computing programme of study for the National Curriculum in England. In this paper, we present an Alice-based implementation of this curriculum. We present how Alice programming environment can be used to teach the subject content enumerated by the new curriculum.
5834868425ff05a97b00e0c6	We envision a future economy where e-markets will play an essential role as exchange hubs for commodities and services. Because of their flexibility, we anticipate multi-unit double auctions (MDAs) to play an important role in future's e-markets. In this paper, we present a multi-unit double auction mechanism which is strategy-proof with respect to reservation price, weakly budget-balanced and individually rational.

Undergraduate and Postgraduate by Coursework students can deposit research outputs (such as journal article, theses).
5834868425ff05a97b00c5eb	We combine linguistic knowledge from corpus data with sensorimotor data obtained experimentally in an effort to better specify the minimum conceptual representation of a motion event that distinguishes it from all other events. Sensorimotor data are collected by measuring the performance of speakers of Modern Greek and American English. We focus on the clustering of motor actions and its correspondence to previous linguistic classifications of both languages.
5834868425ff05a97b00c8ca	Tremor was recorded under simulated vitreoretinal microsurgical conditions as subjects attempted to hold an instrument motionless. Several autoregressive models (AR, ARMA, multivariate, and nonlinear) are generated to predict the next value of tremor. It is shown that a sixth order ARMA model predictor can predict a tremor having an amplitude of 96.6±84.5 microns RMS with an error of 8.2±5.9 microns RMS, a mean improvement of 47.5% over simple last-value prediction.
5834868425ff05a97b00c900	Inertial sensors, like accelerometers and gyroscopes, are rarely used by themselves to measure displacement. Accuracy of inertial sensors is greatly handicapped by the notorious integration drift, which arises due to numerical integration of the sensors zero bias error. A solution is proposed in this paper to provide drift free estimation of displacement from inertial sensors.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4fb	An iterative language translation system includes multiple communicatively connected statistical speech translation systems. The system includes an automatic speech recognition component adapted to recognize spoken language in a source language and to create a source language hypothesis. A machine translation component is adapted to translate the source language hypothesis into a target language. The system also includes a second automatic speech recognition component and second machine translation component.
5834868425ff05a97b00e50b	Computer-implemented systems and methods for extracting information during a human-to-human mono-lingual or multi-lingual dialog between two speakers are disclosed. Information from either the recognized speech (or the translation thereof) by the second speaker and/or the recognized speech by the first speaker (or the translation thereof) is extracted. The extracted information is then entered into an electronic form stored in a data store.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8d2	This extended abstract addresses the optimal assignment of spatially distributed tasks to a team of heterogeneous mobile agents in domains in which tasks may be related by precedence or simultaneity constraints and have a choice of locations at which they can be performed. The manner in which constraints are satisfied and the locations chosen for tasks both impact the overall team utility. We analyze the impact of these problem features on the efficiency of the solution process.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4e7	We develop an efficient representation and a pre-unification algorithm in the style of Huet (1975) for the linear/spl lambda/-calculus/spl lambda//sup/spl rarr//spl rArr/0&T/which includes intuitionistic functions (/spl rarr/), linear functions (/spl rArr/), additive pairing (&), and additive unit (T). Applications lie in proof scorch, logic programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We also show that, surprisingly, a similar pre-unification algorithm does not exist for certain sublanguages.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8d3	We address the problem of optimally assigning spatially distributed tasks to a team of heterogeneous mobile agents in domains with inter-task temporal constraints, such as precedence constraints. Due to delay penalties, satisfying the temporal constraints impacts the overall team cost. We present a mathematical model of the problem, a benchmark anytime bounded optimal solution process, and an analysis of the impact of delay penalties on problem difficulty.
5834868425ff05a97b00c60d	This poster describes a controlled study that examines how individual motivation orientations affect computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) activities with an adaptive thermodynamics dialogue tutor. Our results show that motivation orientation has an effect on perceptions of one's learning partner, and possibly one's self-confidence.
5834868425ff05a97b00cc7e	The time is ripe for defining metrics for various aspects of pervasive computing and for developing \nbenchmarks that let us compare systems with respect to these metrics.   Note: OCR errors may \nbe found in this Reference List extracted from the full text article. ACM has opted to expose the \ncomplete List rather than only correct and linked references.   Note: Larger/Darker text within \neach node indicates a higher relevance of the materials to the taxonomic classification.   Pervasive \ncomputing is defined as a discipline that integrates computing into the environment [1].
5834868425ff05a97b00e376	Let β be an arbitrary limit ordinal. A β-re set is l-finite iff all its β-re subsets are β-recursive. The l-finite sets correspond to the ideal of finite sets in the lattice of re sets. We give a characterization of l-finite sets in terms of their ordertype: a β-re set is l-finite iff it has ordertype less than β*, the Σ 1, projectum of β).
5834868425ff05a97b00cc9b	The success of cloud computing can lead to large, centralized collections of virtual machine~(VM) images. The ability to interactively search these VM images at a high semantic level emerges as an important capability. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges in creating such a search capability, and presents early evidence of its feasibility.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0e2	We describe a deep generative model in which the lowest layer represents the word-count vector of a document and the top layer represents a learned binary code for that document. The top two layers of the generative model form an undirected associative memory and the remaining layers form a belief net with directed, top-down connections. We present efficient learning and inference procedures for this type of generative model and show that it allows more accurate and much faster retrieval than latent semantic analysis.
5834868425ff05a97b00d31b	At the AAAI 2005 Robot Exhibition, the robot GRACE played a game of “social tag” that involved human-robot social interaction, navigation, and interface design. The task was for GRACE to locate and rendezvous with one of our team members, who was wearing a pink hat. The robot found the target not primarily through the modalities of sight or sound, but rather through social interactions with strangers in the environment.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4c6	The major problems of modern software involve finding effective techniques and tools for organizing and maintaining large, complex programs. The key concept in modern programming for controlling complexity is abstraction, that is, selective emphasis on detail. This monograph discusses how the Ada programming language provides ways to support and exploit such abstraction techniques.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0e3	We present a simple new Monte Carlo algorithm for evaluating probabilities of observations in complex latent variable models, such as Deep Belief Networks. While the method is based on Markov chains, estimates based on short runs are formally unbiased. In expectation, the log probability of a test set will be underestimated, and this could form the basis of a probabilistic bound. The method is much cheaper than gold-standard annealing-based methods and only slightly more expensive than the cheapest Monte Carlo methods.
5834868425ff05a97b00e390	We study iterated transductions defined by a class of invertible Mealy automata over the binary alphabet. It is shown that in some cases the resulting orbit relation is rational and we determine the complexity of several natural computational problems associated with the iterated transductions. In particular, we show how to compute timestamps and coordinates.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8f0	Hydraulic excavators are large, powerful machines which are often operated in high-production settings. Successful automation of excavators for mass excavation tasks require safeguarding algorithms which do not negatively impact productivity. We present a two-level sensor-based safeguarding approach which utilizes obstacle detection to prevent collisions and motion detection to halt operation when unanticipated vehicles or people approach the excavator.
5834868425ff05a97b00e567	This paper describes experiments towards a multilanguage human-computer speech interface. Our interface is designed for large vocabulary continuous speech input. For this purpose a multilingual dictation database has been collected under GlobalPhone, which is a project at the Interactive Systems Labs. This project investigates LVCSR systems in 15 languages of the world, namely Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, and Turkish.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5c4	Executive Summary The Urban Challenge represents a technological leap beyond the previous Grand Challenges. The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868425ff05a97b00e571	This paper describes our phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system for the WMT10 Translation Task. We submitted translations for the German to English and English to German translation tasks. Compared to state-of-the-art phrase-based systems we preformed additional preprocessing and used a discriminative word alignment approach. The word reordering was modeled using POS information and we extended the translation model with additional features.
5834868425ff05a97b00cc5a	Framework interfaces are complex, so programmers often copy repeating patterns, either their own or from others, to interact with them. Design Fragments allow framework interactions to be explicitly defined, describing known-good uses of the framework. We demonstrate a tool that provides continual feedback on framework conformance as a program evolves.
5834868425ff05a97b00c441	The recent result of Friedgut, Kalai and Nisan [9] gives a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem regarding manipulation in elections, but holds only for neutral social choice functions and three alternatives. We complement their theorem by proving a similar result regarding Pareto-Optimal social choice functions when the number of voters is two. We discuss the implications of our results with respect to the agenda of precluding manipulation in elections by means of computational hardness.
5834868425ff05a97b00ccb1	Weak connectivity is characterized by slow or intermittent networks. Distributed file systems using weak connections must function in spite of limited bandwidth and frequent connectivity changes. Callback-based cache coherence schemes were designed to minimize client-server communication, but with an underlying assumption that the network is fast and reliable (ie, a LAN). This paper large presents granularity callbacks as a way to reduce the client-server communication necessary to maintain file cache coherence.
5834868425ff05a97b00ccb2	Describes a single unifying abstraction called'dynamic sets', which can offer substantial benefits to search applications. These benefits include greater opportunity in the I/O subsystem to aggressively exploit prefetching and parallelism, as well as support for associative naming to complement the hierarchical naming in typical file systems. This paper motivates dynamic sets and presents the design of a system that embodies this abstraction.
5834868425ff05a97b00c64f	We present a publicly available tool called TagHelper that can be used to support the analysis of conversational data using automatic text classification technology. The contribution of this paper is to explore the limitations of the current simple approach to text processing employed by TagHelper tools with respect to identifying context-sensitive categories of conversational behavior. TagHelper can be downloaded from http://www. cs. cmu. edu/̋cprose/TagHelper. html.
5834868425ff05a97b00c653	In this work, we employ quantitative methods to describe the discourse practices observed in a direction giving task. We place a special emphasis on comparing differences in strategies between two separate populations and between successful and unsuccessful groups. We isolate differences in these strategies through several novel representations of discourse practices. We find that information sharing, instruction giving, and social feedback strategies are distinct between subpopulations in empirically identifiable ways.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3ba	We introduce a hierarchy of linear cellular automata based on their limiting behavior on spatially periodic configurations. We show that it is undecidable to which class in the hierarchy a cellular automaton belongs. In particular, it is undecidable whether all spatially periodic configurations evolve to a fixed point. Furthermore, there is no computable bound on the period lengths of these configurations. Our arguments are based on a non-standard simulation of Turing machines on circular cellular automata.

Quite often this can be accomplished by perusing both ratings and review texts. Unfortunately matrix factorization approaches to recommendation result in large, complex models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we attack this problem through succinct additive co-clustering on both ratings and reviews. Our model yields accurate and interpretable recommendations.
5834868425ff05a97b00d960	There is growing interest in embedding new class of applications in vehicles to improve the user driving experience. However, the limited computational and storage resources in vehicles brings about a challenge of running computation and data intensive tasks of such applications in the vehicle's on-board unit (OBU). Moreover, embedded applications may not be easily updated by replacing hardware as upgrades in the vehicle OBUs can only happen over each vehicular life-cycle, which is of the order of 10-15 years.
5834868425ff05a97b00e61e	JANUS-II is a research system to design and test components of speech-to-speech translation systems as well as a research prototype for such a system. We focus on two aspects of the system:(1) the new features of the speech recognition component JANUS-SR, and (2) the end-to-end performance of JANUS-II, including a comparison of two machine translation strategies used for JANUS-MT (PHOENIX and GLR*).
5834868425ff05a97b00c742	ASAP is a position-measurement instrument developed to measure human hand tremor. It makes 1000 five-degree-of-freedom position measurements per second with 3 micron resolution over a 3cm workspace. The measurement principle is optical triangulation of modulated lights on the probe using position-sensitive-diode (PSD) sensors.
5834868425ff05a97b00d320	Graphs are an important data structure throughout computer science. This example displays an implementation of a simple package providing an abstraction of directed graphs. The specification includes type definitions that culminate in the Obj record type. Obj serves to define the structure of directed graphs. The user is responsible for allocation, initialization and manipulation of the nodes that form a graph.
5834868425ff05a97b00da37	This paper presents a thorough theoretical analysis of a recently developed anytime incremental planning algorithm called Anytime Dynamic A*(AD*).

D. degree in computer science from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 1993.

5834868525ff05a97b00f317	Let F be a distribution with probability density f= F′ and let X_1, ..., X_n ∼ F be an IID sample from F. The goal of nonparametric density estimation is to estimate f with as few assumptions about f as possible. We denote the estimator by f_n. As with nonparametric regression, the estimator will depend on a smoothing parameter h and choosing h carefully is important.
5834868525ff05a97b00f32f	We discuss non-parametric density estimation and regression for astrophysics problems. In particular, we show how to compute non-parametric confidence intervals for the location and size of peaks of a function. We illustrate these ideas with recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also briefly discuss non-parametric Bayesian inference.
5834868425ff05a97b00d21d	M. Sitti and co-workers find that gallium exhibits highly reversible and switchable adhesive characteristics during the liquid–solid phase change. As described on page 5088, this reversible adhesive allows miniature capsule-like robots, which are able to easily pick-and-place objects with irregular geometries and rough surfaces, and thus assemble such objects into a complex structure. The contact interface between gallium and the rough object is illustrated in the magnified image.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5af	Abstract-We propose a methodology to automatically generate plans for a robot excavator like a bucket loader or a backhoe. The task is formulated as one of constrained optimization in an action space that is spanned by the parameters of a prototypical digging plan. We show how geometric and force constraints are imposed on the action space to build the set of feasible plans, and discuss methods to optimize a cost function within this set. We discuss recent simulation results that demonstrate this method in action.
5834868425ff05a97b00dabc	Multi-hop message forwarding based on geographic coordinates is a fundamental building block for vehicular communication. However, the unstable links and wide range of node densities make it challenging to design an algorithm suitable for vehicular use. We introduce DAZL, a new forwarding protocol that combines three concepts in a novel way. First, multiple nodes cooperate in packet forwarding. Compared with traditional single relay schemes, this provides robustness against changes in topology and packet delivery rates.
5834868425ff05a97b00cf5f	Advances in 3D sensing technologies have made the availability of RGB and Depth information easier than earlier which can greatly assist in the semantic segmentation of 2D scenes. There are many works in literature that perform semantic segmentation in such scenes, but few relates to the environment that possesses a high degree of clutter in general eg indoor scenes. In this paper, we explore the use of depth information along with RGB and deep convolutional network for indoor scene understanding through semantic labeling.
5834868425ff05a97b00cb36	Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions of Internet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content, rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internet does not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric naming proposals, since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6eb	In this paper we describe the components of our statistical machine translation system. This system combines phrase-tophrase translations extracted from a bilingual corpus using different alignment approaches. Special methods to extract and align named entities are used. We show how a manual lexicon can be incorporated into the statistical system in an optimized way. Experiments on Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English translation tasks are presented.
5834868525ff05a97b00eaae	The electrical transport properties of C/sub 70/and C/sub 60/fullerene peapods are investigated. We report the fabrications and performances of field-effect transistors (FETs) based on C/sub 70/and C/sub 60/fullerene peapods. Most of the fullerene peapod-FETs exhibit ambipolar characteristics at room temperature in air. The origin of ambipolar behavior is also qualitatively discussed. The ambipolar FETs based on fullerene peapods exhibit hysteresis effect in their electrical characteristics.
5834868425ff05a97b00e503	Using the Internet for the collection of data is quite common these days. This process is called crowdsourcing and enables the collection of large amounts of data at reasonable costs. While being an inexpensive method, this data typically is of lower quality. Filtering data sets is therefore required. The occurring errors can be classified into different groups. There are technical issues and human errors. For speech recording, technical issues could be a noisy background. Human errors arise when the task is misunderstood.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8a4	In support vector (SV) regression, a parameter/spl nu/controls the number of support vectors and the number of points that come to lie outside of the so-called/spl epsi/-insensitive tube. For various noise models and SV parameter settings, we experimentally determine the values of/spl nu/that lead to the lowest generalization error. We find good agreement with the values that had previously been predicted by a theoretical argument based on the asymptotic efficiency of a simplified model of SV regression.
5834868425ff05a97b00e50a	Computer-implemented systems and methods for extracting information during a human-to-human mono-lingual or multi-lingual dialog between two speakers are disclosed. Information from either the recognized speech (or the translation thereof) by the second speaker and/or the recognized speech by the first speaker (or the translation thereof) is extracted. The extracted information is then entered into an electronic form stored in a data store.
5834868425ff05a97b00e50d	Recently, the development of neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the translation quality of automatic machine translation. While most sentences are more accurate and fluent than translations by statistical machine translation (SMT)-based systems, in some cases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely different meaning. This is especially the case when rare words occur.
5834868525ff05a97b00f363	We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting. Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures.
5834868425ff05a97b00d670	Existing complexity bounds for point-based POMDP value iteration algorithms focus either on the curse of dimensionality or the curse of history. We derive a new bound that relies on both and uses the concept of discounted reachability; our conclusions may help guide future algorithm design. We also discuss recent improvements to our (point-based) heuristic search value iteration algorithm. Our new implementation calculates tighter initial bounds, avoids solving linear programs, and makes more effective use of sparsity.
5834868425ff05a97b00d6a7	A relative pose between two cameras is determined by using input data obtained from the motion of subjects, such as pedestrians, between the fields of view of two cameras, determining trajectory information for the subjects, and computing homographies relating lines obtained from trajectories in the first image data to lines obtained from the trajectories in the second image data. The two fields of view need not overlap.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9b0	The concept of Support Vector Regression is extended to a more general class of convex cost functions. It is shown how the resulting convex constrained optimization problems can be efficiently solved by a Primal-Dual Interior Point path following method. Both computational feasibility and improvement of estimation is demonstrated in the experiments.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9bf	We review recent methods for learning with positive definite kernels. All these methods formulate learning and estimation problems as linear tasks in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with a kernel. We cover a wide range of methods, ranging from simple classifiers to sophisticated methods for estimation with structured data.
5834868425ff05a97b00d73f	Different architectural styles lead not simply to different designs, but to designs with significantly different properties. This look at 11 designs of a cruise-control system shows that solutions varied, even within a design style, because of how the architectural choice leads the designer to view the system's environment.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6fc	Incremental Design of large nets based on smaller subcomponent nets. It is shown that small networks trained to perform limited tasks develop time invariant, hidden abstractions that can subsequently be exploited to train larger, more complex nets efficiently. Using these techniques, phoneme recognition networks of increasing complexity can be constructed that all achieve superior recognition performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd6c	Many licensed and unlicensed frequency bands support heterogeneous wireless networks running different physical and link layer protocols. These networks “share” spectrum, but in an anarchic and arbitrary manner, resulting in poor performance for some networks and sub-optimal performance in aggregate. This problem is likely to be of importance in the US 700 MHz TV band, which is being explored for secondary use. This paper describes Metronome, a system that allows heterogeneous networks to coexist well.
5834868425ff05a97b00c790	In this paper we ask, Can anything be said about a smallest circuit that computes a given function. We are able to show that for a wide class of functions, which includes all graph problems, an optimal circuit has a restricted structure. For instance, the input wires in an optimal circuit for Hamiltonian Path have at most linear fan-out. This is analogous to the possibly counter-intuitive statement that there is a straight line program for Hamiltonian Path on graphs with n nodes that looks at each edge only O (n 2) times.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8f7	We present a hybrid system for reasoning over contextual and spatial elements of environments. The system, designed for deployment in robot architectures, leverages a knowledge base framework for common-sense reasoning through the integration with the symbolic and sub-symbolic structures of a cognitive architecture. Methodological and functional aspects are illustrated, together with an overview of the results obtained in a synthetic simulation experiment.
5834868425ff05a97b00e046	In this paper, we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of Web services described in OWL-S. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow and the data flow of OWL-S Process Models. The result of our work provides a modeling and verification procedure for OWL-S Process Models.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7a0	We introduce the super-bit conjecture, which allows the development of a theory generalizing the notion of pseudorandomness so as to fool non-deterministic statistical tests. This new kind of pseudo-randomness rules out the existence of NP/poly-natural properties that can work against P/poly. This is an important extension of the original theory of P/poly-natural proofs [10]. We also introduce the closely related demi-bit conjecture which is more intuitive and is the source of interesting open problems.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8fc	In this paper, we describe a complete system for mission planning and execution for multiple robots in natural terrain. We report on experiments with a system for autonomously driving two vehicles based on complex mission specifications. We show that the system is able to plan local paths in obstacle fields based on sensor data, to plan and update global paths to goals based on frequent obstacle map updates, and to modify mission execution, eg, the assignment and ordering of the goals, based on the updated paths to the goals.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd7a	This paper provides an overview of InfoNet, the networking infrastructure for the InfoPad mobile computing system. First, the goals and architecture of InfoNet is defined. Next, the current implementation, performance measurements, and proxy connections are discussed. Finally, we present the future directions for InfoNet.
5834868425ff05a97b00d6f4	This work presents a framework for the classification of feature films into genres, based only on computable visual cues. We view the work as a step toward high-level semantic film interpretation, currently using low-level video features and knowledge of ubiquitous cinematic practices. Our current domain of study is the movie preview, commercial advertisements primarily created to attract audiences. A preview often emphasizes the theme of a film and hence provides suitable information for classification.
5834868525ff05a97b00f25f	In this post I'll describe one aspect of the problem of estimating a manifold, or manifold \nlearning, as it is called.   Suppose we have data and suppose that the data lie on, or close \nto, a manifold of dimension . There are two different goals we might have in mind.   The first \ngoal is to use the fact that the data lie near the manifold as a way of doing dimension \nreduction. The popular methods for solving this problem include isomap, local linear \nembedding, diffusion maps, and Laplacian eigenmaps among others.
5834868525ff05a97b00f263	Chris Sims is a Nobel prize winning economist who is well known for his work on macroeconomics, Bayesian statistics, vector autoregressions among other things. One of us (LW) had the good fortune to meet Chris at a conference and can attest that he is also a very nice guy.
5834868425ff05a97b00d2a2	Visual odometry can be augmented by depth information such as provided by RGB-D cameras, or from lidars associated with cameras. However, such depth information can be limited by the sensors, leaving large areas in the visual images where depth is unavailable. Here, we propose a method to utilize the depth, even if sparsely available, in recovery of camera motion. In addition, the method utilizes depth by structure from motion using the previously estimated motion, and salient visual features for which depth is unavailable.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7f3	We study density-based clustering under low-noise conditions. Our framework allows for sharply defined clusters such as clusters on lower dimensional manifolds. We show that accurate clustering is possible even in high dimensions. We propose two data-based methods for choosing the bandwidth and we study the stability properties of density clusters. We show that a simple graph-based algorithm known as the “friends-of-friends” algorithm successfully approximates the high density clusters.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9e2	This workshop, as the first of its kind, aims to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners interested in large-scale multimedia data retrieval and mining.

5834868425ff05a97b00d6fd	The design of the Alphard programming language has been strongly influenced by ideas from the areas of programming methodology and formal program verification. The interaction of these ideas and their influence on Alphard are described by developing a nontrivial example, a program for manipulating the parse tree of an arithmetic expression.
5834868425ff05a97b00e052	As human-agent teams get increasingly deployed in the real-world, agent designers need to take into account that humans and agents have different abilities to specify preferences. In this paper, we focus on how human biases in specifying preferences for resources impacts the performance of large, heterogeneous teams. In particular, we model the inclination of humans to simplify their preference functions and to exaggerate their utility for desired resources, and show the effect of these biases on the team performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd8b	In this paper, we consider support for bandwidth-demanding applications such as video broadcasting using DHTs. Our investigations focus on the impact of heterogeneity in the outgoing bandwidth capabilities of nodes on Scribe, a representative and relatively mature DHT-based multicast protocol. We expose important issues that arise due to the mismatch between the ID space that underlies the DHT and the outgoing bandwidth constraints on nodes.

5834868525ff05a97b00f441	Choquet capacities are a generalization of probability measures that arise in robustness, decision theory and game theory. Many capacities that arise in robustness are symmetric or can be transformed into symmetric capacities. We characterize the extreme points of the set of upper distribution functions corresponding to coherent, symmetric Choquet capacities on [0, 1]. We also show that the set of 2-alternating capacities is a simplex and we give a Choquet representation of this set.

5834868425ff05a97b00d84b	The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) is a versatile, albeit computationally expensive tool for statistical modeling of mixture models. In this paper, we introduce a spectral algorithm. We show that it is both computationally and statistically efficient. In particular, we derive the lower-order moments of the HDP and give reconstruction guarantees. Moreover, we show that hierarchical spectral method is able to generate a better results regarding likelihood performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00c7d7	In this paper we explore the problem of selecting appropriate Knowledge Construction Dialogues (KCDs) for the purpose of encouraging students to include important points in their qualitative physics explanations that are missing. We describe a hybrid symbolic/statistical approach developed in the context of the Why 2 conceptual physics tutor (Vanlehn et al., 2002). Our preliminary results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms both the symbolic approach and the statistical approach by themselves.
5834868425ff05a97b00cda3	Webcams, microphones, pressure gauges and other sensors provide exciting new opportunities for querying and monitoring the physical world. In this paper we focus on querying wide area sensor databases, containing (XML) data derived from sensors spread over tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATH queries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a single XML document, while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes.
5834868625ff05a97b010f93	Causal reasoning is difficult for middle school students to grasp. In this research, we wanted to test the possibility of using machine learning for modeling students' causal reasoning in a virtual environment designed to assess this skill. Our findings suggest it is possible to use machine learning to emulate student pathways that are able to predict their causal understanding.
5834868625ff05a97b010fa1	Adaptive hypermedia is one of the most popular approaches of personalized information access. When the field started to emerge, the expectation was that soon nearly all published hypermedia content could be adapted to the needs, preferences, and abilities of its users. However, after a decade and a half, the gap between the amount of total hypermedia content available and the amount of content available in a personalized way is still quite large.
5834868425ff05a97b00d2c7	At the AAAI 2005 Robot Exhibition, the robot GRACE played a game of “social tag” that involved human-robot social interaction, navigation, and interface design. The task was for GRACE to locate and rendezvous with one of our team members, who was wearing a pink hat. The robot found the target not primarily through the modalities of sight or sound, but rather through social interactions with strangers in the environment.
5834868525ff05a97b00ec6b	Background Mucormycosis is a kind of rare opportunistic fungal disease and the incidence of which has gradually increased. Disseminated mucormycosis (DM) is a life-threatening infection that mostly occurs in immunocompromised patients. The lung and brain are usually involved in disseminated mucormycosis, and other sites are scare. We report the first case of disseminated mucormycosis whose infection sites included lung, skin, liver, vertebra, and spinal cord that ensued after a right lung pneumonectomy in an immunocompetent patient.

Further disclosed is a method of manipulating a part by providing a manipulation device with a plurality of fibers, where each fiber has a tip with a flat surface that is parallel to a backing layer, contacting the flat surfaces on an object, moving the object to a new location, then disengaging the tips from the object.
5834868525ff05a97b00f692	In this paper, we explore student dropout behavior in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). We use as a case study a recent Coursera class from which we develop a survival model that allows us to measure the influence of factors extracted from that data on student dropout rate. Specifically we explore factors related to student behavior and social positioning within discussion forums using standard social network analytic techniques. The analysis reveals several significant predictors of dropout.
5834868425ff05a97b00d97d	Clustering is a key component in data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as $ k $-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters.
5834868425ff05a97b00c73d	Pathological tremor is suppressed during glove-based dextrous teleoperation using the Weighted-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner algorithm. This is a computationally inexpensive approach which models the tremor and subtracts it out of the incoming command signal. By suppressing the tremor, RMS error was decreased by 57% in tests combining tremor with a simulated grasping motion.
5834868425ff05a97b00c740	An accurate optical sensing system has been developed to measure the position and orientation of a laser beam in two dimensions. The system is useful for evaluation of the accuracy of hand-held laser microsurgical instruments. The apparatus uses a lens and a beam-splitter to receive the incoming laser beam. Two position sensitive detectors placed at different distances from the beam splitter make it possible to rapidly and accurately calculate the position and orientation of the axis of the laser.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd3b	We investigate the parameter-space geometry of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and develop an adaptation of path-SGD optimization method, attuned to this geometry, that can learn plain RNNs with ReLU activations. On several datasets that require capturing long-term dependency structure, we show that path-SGD can significantly improve trainability of ReLU RNNs compared to RNNs trained with SGD, even with various recently suggested initialization schemes.
5834868525ff05a97b00f338	We find the minimax rate of convergence in Hausdorff distance for estimating a manifold M of dimension d embedded in R^ D given a noisy sample from the manifold. We assume that the manifold satisfies a smoothness condition and that the noise distribution has compact support. We show that the optimal rate of convergence is n^{-2/(2+ d)}. Thus, the minimax rate depends only on the dimension of the manifold, not on the dimension of the space in which M is embedded.
5834868425ff05a97b00d991	We present linear-time estimators for three popular covariate shift correction and propensity scoring algorithms: logistic regression (LR), kernel mean matching (KMM)[19], and maximum entropy mean matching (MEMM)[20]. This allows applications in situations where both treatment and control groups are large. We also show that the last two algorithms differ only in their choice of regularizer (ℓ2 of the Radon Nikodym derivative vs. maximum entropy). Experiments show that all methods scale well.
5834868425ff05a97b00daac	Wireless networking has become a popular topic in both undergraduate and graduate courses. However, putting together good assignments in wireless networking is difficult because the behavior of the wireless network depends strongly on the physical environment. We have used a wireless networking testbed based on signal propagation emulation in a number of wireless networking courses. The wireless emulator supports highly realistic experiments, while also offering a high degree of control and repeatability.
5834868525ff05a97b00ecf1	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) in treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). METHODS: Twenty-one patients with ITP underwent LS. The data of preoperative and postoperative platelet counts, intraoperative blood loss, recovery time, hospital stay time, and complications were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS: The platelet count was elevated rapidly in one week, and peristalsis of alimentary tract was recovered in 24 hours after operation in all cases.
5834868425ff05a97b00d328	We begin by surveying the field of computer science, projecting some future developments, and placing the field in context in academia and society. In Section 2.1, we describe the scope of the field we consider to be computer science. In Section 2.2 we make some projections about the kind of computing we may be doing ten years hence. On the basis of these projections, we predict some of the issues the field must face over the next decade and some of the changes we must anticipate.
5834868425ff05a97b00d20a	This section presents a brief, informal introduction to the Alphard form, the linguistic mechanism we use to define abstractions. Our purpose is primarily to relate the mechanism to its goals, not to explicate it fully; the details are given in the papers that make up this volume.
5834868425ff05a97b00d66b	This paper presents the results of an experiment in human-robot social interaction. Its purpose was to measure the impact of certain features and behaviors on people's willingness to engage in a short interaction with a robot. The behaviors tested were the ability to convey expression with a humanoid face and the ability to indicate attention by turning towards the person that the robot is addressing. We hypothesized that these features were minimal requirements for effective social interaction between a human and a robot.
5834868425ff05a97b00e538	We present an overview of our laboratories' research on Multimodal Human-Computer Interfaces. By exploiting all available channels of human communication we aim to increase exibility, robustness, and naturalness of human-computer interaction. The information sources we process include Speech-, Character-, and Gesture Recognition, Face-and Eye Tracking, Lipreading, and Sound Source Localization. Connectionist and hybrid techniques are used throughout.
5834868425ff05a97b00e53b	A traditional transfer system in machine translation maps between language structures and an intermediate representation. Our connectionist transfer system maps from f-structures of one language to f-structures of another language. It encodes the intermediate representation implicitly in neural networks' activation patterns. The system is learnable, therefore it does not need any effort in handcrafting the representation and mapping rules. Experiments show the system has good scalability and generalisability performance.

So as to improve China and Western contact. What's more, it can also promote the whole world's physical education.
5834868425ff05a97b00db07	We present POMP (Pareto Optimal Motion Planner), an anytime algorithm for geometric path planning on roadmaps. For robots with several degrees of freedom, collision checks are computationally expensive and often dominate planning time. Our goal is to minimize the number of collision checks for obtaining the first feasible path and successively shorter feasible paths. We assume that the roadmaps we search over are embedded in a continuous ambient space, where nearby points tend to share the same collision state.
5834868525ff05a97b00ed91	The activities of applied writing combine the activities of management tightly in the context nowadays. The motivation, subject and object, and the process of applied writing have close relation to management.

5834868525ff05a97b00edad	The matrix extension problem of filters of biorthogonal multivariate wavelets is investigated. When one of a pair of biorthogonal multivariate sealing functions given is an interpolatory one, explicit formulas for constructing filter of the corresponding biorthogonal multivariate wavelets are presented by virtue of the lifting scheme and polyphase matrix decomposition. Their properties of biorthogonal multivariate wavelet packets are characterized, and two biorthogonality formula concerning the wavelet packets are obtained.
5834868425ff05a97b00e56c	We present an Online Server for Machine Translation Evaluation that offers improvements over the standard usage of the typical scoring scripts. Users are able to interactively define their own test sets, experiments and pre-processing steps. Several scores are automatically calculated for submitted translations and the hypotheses and scores are organized and archived for later review. The server offers a nice web based user interface.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4c0	This paper proposes a new training method for the phoneme identification neural network called “neural fuzzy training.” In the proposed training, nondeterministic (fuzzy) class information is assigned to the training signal, in contrast to the traditional method where a deterministic class information is assigned.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4c4	JANUS II is a research system to design and test components of speech to speech translation systems as well as a research prototype for such a system. We will focus on two aspects of the system: 1) new features and recognition performance of the speech recognition component JANUS-SR and 2) the end-to-end performance of JANUS II, including a comparison of two machine translation strategies used for JANUS-MT (PHOENIX and GLR*).
5834868425ff05a97b00d58e	We examine the scenario in which a mobile network of robots must search, survey, or cover an environment and communication is restricted by relative location. While many algorithms choose to maintain a connected network at all times while performing such tasks, we relax this requirement and examine the use of periodic connectivity, where the network must regain connectivity at a fixed interval. We propose an online algorithm that scales linearly in the number of robots and allows for arbitrary periodic connectivity constraints.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5b6	This paper concerns an outdoor mobile robot that learns to avoid collisions by observing a human driver operate a vehicle equipped with sensors that continuously produce a map of the local environment. We have implemented steering control that models human behavior in trying to avoid obstacles while trying to follow a desired path. Here we present the formulation for this control system and its independent parameters and then show how these parameters can be automatically estimated by observing a human driver.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd85	TCP Incast plagues scalable cluster-based storage built atop standard TCP/IP-over-Ethernet, often resulting in much lower client read bandwidth than can be provided by the available network links. This paper reviews the Incast problem and discusses potential application-level approaches to avoiding it.
5834868525ff05a97b00eaea	A network of coupling identical oscillators is considered. The nearest neighbor level spacing distribution in random matrix theory is used to bridge the synchronizability and the collective chaos, a new concept introduced in one of our recent works. The collective chaotic process of the considered system may be a possible dynamical mechanism for the synchronization. A much more informative measure of synchronizaability is proposed.
5834868425ff05a97b00c758	In this paper we describe TouchViz, an information visualization system for tablets that encourages rich interaction, exploration, and play through references to physical models. TouchViz turns data into physical objects that experience forces and respond to the user. We describe the design of the system and conduct a user study to explore its use, finding that it supports many different models of data exploration and encourages users to have fun exploring data.
5834868525ff05a97b00fc49	TPR, DTA and XRD methods were employed to study a modified copper-based catalyst, NC208, for methanol synthesis. A temperaturereduction program established on the basis of diluted hydrogen activation of the catalyst has been successfully used in the commercial production of methanol with a good yield.
5834868425ff05a97b00db47	We use a combination of laser data, measurements of joint angles and torques, and stall information to improve localization on a household robotic platform. Our system executes trajectories to collide with its environment and performs probabilistic updates on a distribution of possible robot positions, ordinarily provided by a laser range finder. We find encouraging results both in simulations and in a real-world kitchen environment. Our analysis also suggests further steps in localization through proprioception.
5834868425ff05a97b00e38c	The state complexity of the cover language of sofic shifts arising from cellular automata is studied. It is shown that in the case where the underlying automaton is nearly a permutation automaton the deterministic automaton obtained by the classical Rabin-Scott construction is already reduced.
5834868425ff05a97b00e39b	We study iterated transductions defined by a class of invertible transducers over the binary alphabet. The transduction semigroups of these automata turn out to be free Abelian groups and the orbits of finite words can be described as affine subspaces in a suitable geometry defined by the generators of these groups. We show that iterated transductions are rational for a subclass of our automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3ab	We study the orbits of reversible one-dimensional cellular automata. It is shown that the Turing degree structure of the orbits of these automata is the same as for general cellular automata. In particular there are reversible cellular automata whose orbits have arbitrary recursively enumerable degree.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3ac	We show that the first order theory of a one-dimensional cellular automaton, construed as a structure with the global map and equality, is decidable. The argument employs bi-infinite versions of Büchi automata that can also be used to demonstrate that the spectra of cellular automata on finite grids are regular. For existential properties our method can be used to produce witnesses.
5834868525ff05a97b00f7e9	Shells made of sprayed ferrous materials are feasible for prototype and limited production tooling. A systematic study of the microstructure of arc-sprayed ferrous structures is presented, demonstrating why these structures display a degree of mechanical anisotropic behavior. The results of controlling oxide formation with inert atomization gases are given, and methods for tailoring the composition and orientation of the lamellae through robotically controlled deposition are discussed.
5834868425ff05a97b00db51	We present a method for performing transductive inference on very large datasets. Our algorithm is based on multiclass Gaussian processes and is effective whenever the multiplication of the kernel matrix or its inverse with a vector can be computed sufficiently fast. This holds, for instance, for certain graph and string kernels. Transduction is achieved by variational inference over the unlabeled data subject to a balancing constraint.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3b9	A σ-automaton is an additive, binary cellular automaton on a graph. For product graphs such as a grids and cylinders, reversibility and periodicity properties of the corresponding σ-automaton can be expressed in terms of a binary version of Chebyshev polynomials. We will give a detailed analysis of the divisibility properties of these polynomials and apply our results to the study of σ-automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00e590	We describe and experimentally evaluate a system, FeasPar, that learns parsing spontaneous speech. The FeasPar architecture consists of neural networks and a search. The neural networks learns the parsing task, and the search improves performance by finding the most probable and consistent feature structure.
5834868425ff05a97b00d31c	This paper presents a robot search task (social tag) that uses social interaction, in the form of asking for help, as an integral component of task completion. We define socially distributed perception as a robot's ability to augment its limited sensory capacities through social interaction.
5834868425ff05a97b00d32d	The curriculum described here was developed in response to objectives set forth in Spring 1982 [104]. The premises and goals from that project plan are reproduced in this section. Although these objectives were formulated with Carnegie-Mellon in mind, they are appropriate for a wide variety of institutions.
5834868425ff05a97b00d20c	After some experience with the definitions and use of Alphard, we realized that generic definitions—form and routine defintions that take types as parameters—provide a rich abstraction tool when coupled with careful specification of the properties of the generic parameters.
5834868425ff05a97b00d63a	Robot software systems tend to be complex. This complexity is due, in large part, to the need to control diverse sensors and actuators in real time, in the face of significant uncertainty and noise. Robot systems must work to achieve tasks while monitoring for, and reacting to, unexpected situations. Doing all this concurrently and asynchronously adds immensely to system complexity. The use of a well-conceived architecture, together with programming tools that support the architecture, can often help to manage that complexity.
5834868525ff05a97b00f35b	АННОТАЦИЯ: Persistent homology probes topological properties from point clouds and functions. By looking at multiple scales simultaneously, one can record the births and deaths of topological features as the scale varies. In this paper we use a statistical technique, the empirical bootstrap, to separate topological signal from topological noise. In particular, we derive confidence sets for persistence diagrams and confidence bands for persistence landscapes. The article is published in the author's wording.
5834868425ff05a97b00d21f	On page 2325, Ajay Vikram Singh and Metin Sitti propose a facile surface patterning technique and a specific, strong biotin–streptavidin bonding of bacteria on patterned surfaces to fabricate Janus particles that are propelled by the attached bacteria. Such bacteria-driven Janus microswimmers could be used for future medicine in targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation.
5834868525ff05a97b00f35c	We derive prior distributions for the bivariate binomial model using Bernardo's (1979) method. These priors are compared to the Jeifreys prior and to a prior proposed by Crowder & Sweeting (1989). The priors possess desirable symmetry properties since we allow them to depend on the parameter of interest.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3bd	De Bruijn graphs provide a convenient way to describe configurations of linear cellular automata (CAs). Using these graphs, we give a simple quadratic time algorithm to determine whether a linear CA is reversible. Similarly, one can decide in quadratic time whether the global map of the automaton is surjective. We also show that every recursive configuration that has a predecessor on a linear CA already has a recursive predecessor. By contradistinction, it is in general impossible to compute such a predecessor effectively.
5834868425ff05a97b00db59	We consider the problem of Bayesian learning on sensitive datasets and present two simple but somewhat surprising results that connect Bayesian learning to “differential privacy”, a cryptographic approach to protect individuallevel privacy while permitting database-level utility. Specifically, we show that under standard assumptions, getting one sample from a posterior distribution is differentially private “for free”; and this sample as a statistical estimator is often consistent, near optimal, and computationally tractable.

5834868425ff05a97b00d450	The authors draw on their experience with the autonomy technology demonstration on NASA's Deep Space One mission to describe the wide-ranging effect autonomy will have on the development of spacecraft software. Autonomy technology for high-level closed loop control of spacecraft offers considerable benefits to space flight projects.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4fe	An examination of the general practice of science, and in particular the interaction of experiment and analysis to generate structurally based system models, suggests a paradigm for the development of a science of software evaluation. We present a view of the development of structured models that is appropriate to software evaluation. We suggest research problems and research techniques which can lead to improvement in software measurement and evaluation methods.
5834868525ff05a97b00ec0d	Helical milling is a hole making process by milling in which the center of end mill orbits around the center of the hole while spinning on its axis and feeding in the axial direction. This paper makes a comparison between drilling and helical milling in cutting forces, hole quality and tool wear through a series of experiments. The results show that the axial cutting force of helical milling is far less than that of drilling and the holes quality is also better than traditional drilling. Cutting tools show excellent machinability in helical milling.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3e4	A single web page in a complex web application has a huge number of possible runtime states. Functions, like JavaScript event handlers, that operate on such pages are extremely difficult to write correctly, because there are virtually no guaranteed constraints on the page. In this paper we propose DynXML, a new language for the web which safely and naturally mutates XML trees. Any dynamic web application written in DynXML is statically guaranteed to maintain the page in a subtype of a programmer-defined page type.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3e5	Plaid is a language in which objects are defined not by fixed classes, but by changing abstract states. We will overview he Plaid programming language through a series of examples drawing from domains like I/O code and web applications. Attendees will write Plaid code and experience its benefits.
5834868425ff05a97b00d620	Less than a decade ago, the focus in refinement planning was on partial order planners using lifted actions. Today, the currently most successful refinement planners are all state space planners using ground actions—ie actions where all parameters have been substituted by objects. In this paper, we address the role of ground actions in refinement planning, and present empirical results indicating that their role is twofold. First, planning with ground actions represents a bias towards early commitment of parameter bindings.
5834868425ff05a97b00d23e	Synthetic micro-pillar dry adhesives were developed based on the micro-and nano-structures used by geckos and beetles. These bio-inspired adhesives will supplement the existing respirator peripheral seal to enhance protection in wet or dirty environments and during head movements. Polyurethane microfiber arrays were fabricated with various geometries. Adhesion was measured on hard, soft, rough, and smooth surfaces. Small diameter, spatulate-tipped microfibers showed the greatest adhesion on all substrates.
5834868525ff05a97b00f36c	We present an efficient algorithm to actively select queries for learning the boundaries separating a function domain into regions where the function is above and below a given threshold. We develop experiment selection methods based on entropy, misclassification rate, variance, and their combinations, and show how they perform on a number of data sets. We then show how these algorithms are used to determine simultaneously valid 1− α confidence intervals for seven cosmological parameters.
5834868525ff05a97b00f36d	The power of multiple testing procedures can be increased by using weighted p-values (Genovese, Roeder and Wasserman 2005). We derive the optimal weights and we show that the power is remarkably robust to misspecification of these weights. We consider two methods for choosing weights in practice. The first, external weighting, is based on prior information. The second, estimated weighting, uses the data to choose weights.
5834868425ff05a97b00d36f	The Alphard language was designed to support the joint goals of facilitating contemporary programming methodology, encouraging formal specification of programs and verification of those specifications, allowing the programmer to exercise control over details that affect performance, and being able to compile compact, efficient code. This report presents the informal definition of the complete language.
5834868625ff05a97b010ff6	To be trustworthy, security-sensitive applications must be small and simple--or wimpy. Because of their limited size and functions, they must securely compose with large, untrusted commodity systems--or giants--to survive. A security architecture based on a wimpy kernel can provide on-demand isolated I/O channels for wimp applications without bloating the underlying trusted computing base.
5834868425ff05a97b00e40c	In this paper, we propose an SVM based shot classification scheme, which categorizes shots of soccer videos into 4 kinds, namely global shots, medium shots, close-up shots and audience shots. The proposed scheme consists in a new adaptive dominant color detection algorithm, as well as a novel feature, the projection histogram. Experiments show that our scheme performs competitively and our new feature is effective.
5834868525ff05a97b00f359	We present a method that scans a random field for localized clusters while controlling the fraction of false discoveries. We use a kernel density estimator as the test statistic and adjust for the bias in this estimator by a method we introduce in this paper. We also show how to combine information across multiple bandwidths while maintaining false discovery control.
5834868425ff05a97b00c782	1. Peter Bro Miltersen Upper and lower bounds for locally decodable source codes. A locally \ndecodable source code encodes a bitstring as a short codeword (of length as close to the first \norder entropy of the original string as possible), so that any individual bit of the original string \ncan be retrieved with high confidence by looking at a single bit (chosen according to a randomized \nstrategy) of the codeword. We give upper and lower bounds for the lengths of locally decodable \nsource codes. The lower bounds are based on lower bounds for k-cover free set systems.
5834868425ff05a97b00cd59	How can we detect suspicious users in large online networks? Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4ae	We formally verify hybrid safety properties of cooperation protocols in a fully parametric version of the European Train Control System (ETCS). We present a formal model using hybrid programs and verify correctness using our logic-based decomposition procedure. This procedure supports free parameters and parameter discovery, which is required to determine correct design choices for free parameters of ETCS.
5834868525ff05a97b00f27f	The nature of astronomical data is changing: data volumes are following Moore's law with a doubling every 18 months and data sets consisting of a billion data vectors in a 100-dimensional parameter space are becoming commonplace. Sophisticated statistical techniques are crucial to fully and efficiently exploit these and maximize the scientific return.
5834868425ff05a97b00c4b4	We study how CPS technology can help improve freeway traffic by combining local car GPS positioning, traffic center control decisions, and communication to achieve more tightly coupled feedback control in intelligent speed adaptation. We develop models for an intelligent speed adaptation that respects variable speed limit control and incident management. We identify safe ranges for crucial design parameters in these systems and, using the theorem prover KeYmaera, formally verify safety of the resulting CPS models.
5834868425ff05a97b00d179	Present invention describes a patterned and coated micro-and nano-scale fibers elastomeric material for enhanced adhesion in wet or dry environments. A multi-step fabrication process including optical lithography, micromolding, polymer synthesis, dipping, stamping, and photopolymerization is described to produce uniform arrays of micron-scale fibers with mushroom-shaped tips coated with a thin layer of an intrinsically adhesive synthetic polymer, such as lightly crosslinked p (DMA-co-MEA).
5834868525ff05a97b010833	A novel melting process for the Ni-based alloy K4169 was developed using 50% revert alloy and 50% green alloy, and the revert alloy was recycled 4 times. The microstructure of green alloy and revert alloy was observed using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effects of revert recycle times on their chemical composition, mechanical properties and rupture life were investigated by inductive coupling plasma mass analyzer (ICP-MS, JY70 PLUS) and mechanical measurement at various temperatures.
5834868425ff05a97b00db65	Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated in the framework of statistical independence such as the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. In this paper, we extend this criterion to deal with with structured and interdependent observations. This is achieved by modeling the structures using undirected graphical models and comparing the Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. We apply this new criterion to independent component analysis and sequence clustering.
5834868425ff05a97b00d678	We propose a model independent procedure for verifying properties of discrete event systems. The dynamics of such systems can be very complex, making them hard to analyze, so we resort to methods based on Monte Carlo simulation and statistical hypothesis testing. The verification is probabilistic in two senses. First, the properties, expressed as CSL formulas, can be probabilistic. Second, the result of the verification is probabilistic, and the probability of error is bounded by two parameters passed to the verification procedure.
5834868425ff05a97b00d680	This paper presents several modifications to the basic rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) search algorithm. The fundamental idea is to utilize a heuristic quality function to guide the search. Results from a relevant simulation experiment illustrate the benefit and drawbacks of the developed algorithms. The paper concludes with several promising directions for future research.
5834868425ff05a97b00d3f3	This article presents perception and navigation systems for a family of autonomous orchard vehicles. The systems are customized to enable safe and reliable driving in modern planting environments. The perception system is based on a global positioning system (GPS)-free sensor suite composed of a twodimensional (2-D) laser scanner, wheel and steering encoders, and algorithms that process the sensor data and output the vehicle's location in the orchard and guidance commands for row following and turning.
5834868425ff05a97b00d517	This paper proposes an underactuated modular climbing robot with flat dry elastomer adhesives. This robot is designed to achieve high speed, high payload, and dexterous motions that are typical drawbacks of previous climbing robots. Each module is designed as a tread-wheeled mechanism to simultaneously realize high speed and high adhesive force. Two modules are connected by compliant joints, which induce a positive preload on the front wheels resulting in stable climbing and high payload capacity.
5834868425ff05a97b00d3dd	We identify the contributions of a general software architecture for intelligent robotics under development at our lab: first, by placing it in the context of a taxonomy of intelligent robotic functionalities, and second, by relating it to the challenges posed by future planetary surface construction scenarios.
5834868425ff05a97b00e447	Several real world applications of humanoids in general will require continuous service over a long time period. A humanoid robot operating in different environments over a long period of time means that A) there will be a lot of variation in the speech it has to ground semantically and B) it has to know when a conversation is of interest in order to respond.
5834868425ff05a97b00d685	We explore Debatepedia, a communityauthored encyclopedia of sociopolitical debates, as evidence for inferring a lowdimensional, human-interpretable representation in the domain of issues and positions. We introduce a generative model positing latent topics and cross-cutting positions that gives special treatment to person mentions and opinion words. We evaluate the resulting representation's usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.
5834868425ff05a97b00d967	In this paper, we present two new communication-efficient methods for distributed minimization of an average of functions. The first algorithm is an inexact variant of the DANE algorithm that allows any local algorithm to return an approximate solution to a local subproblem. We show that such a strategy does not affect the theoretical guarantees of DANE significantly. In fact, our approach can be viewed as a robustification strategy since the method is substantially better behaved than DANE on data partition arising in practice.
5834868425ff05a97b00d97a	As binary classification problems are much easier to solve many techniques exist to decompose multi-class classification problems into many binary classification problems (voting, error codes, etc.). Pairwise coupling (one against one) constructs a rule for discriminating between every pair of classes and then selecting the class with the most winning two-class decisions. By using Platt's probabilities output for SVM one can get a class probability for each of the k (k− 1)/2 models created in the pairwise classification.
5834868425ff05a97b00d57b	In this paper, we explore student dropout behavior in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC). We use as a case study a recent Coursera class from which we develop a survival model that allows us to measure the influence of factors extracted from that data on student dropout rate. Specifically we explore factors related to student behavior and social positioning within discussion forums using standard social network analytic techniques. The analysis reveals several significant predictors of dropout.
5834868425ff05a97b00d996	NVIDIA have released a new platform (CUDA) for general purpose computing on their graphical processing units (GPU). This paper evaluates use of this platform for statistical machine learning applications. The transfer rates to and from the GPU are measured, as is the performance of matrix vector operations on the GPU. An implementation of a sparse matrix vector product on the GPU is outlined and evaluated. Performance comparisons are made with the host processor.
5834868425ff05a97b00e45f	This paper describes our phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system for the WMT10 Translation Task. We submitted translations for the German to English and English to German translation tasks. Compared to state-of-the-art phrase-based systems we preformed additional preprocessing and used a discriminative word alignment approach. The word reordering was modeled using POS information and we extended the translation model with additional features.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc82	We describe a family of recently developed heuristicbased algorithms used for path planning in the real world. We discuss the fundamental similarities between static algorithms (eg A*), replanning algorithms (eg D*), anytime algorithms (eg ARA*), and anytime replanning algorithms (eg AD*). We introduce the motivation behind each class of algorithms, discuss their use on real robotic systems, and highlight their practical benefits and disadvantages.
5834868425ff05a97b00de01	Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are popular in motion planning because they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT* s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8c6	We describe a heuristic search algorithm for generating optimal plans in a new class of decision problem, characterized by the incorporation of hidden state. The approach exploits the nature of the hidden state to reduce the state space by orders of magnitude. It then interleaves AO*-type heuristic expansion of the reduced space with forwards and backwards propagation phases to produce a solution in a fraction of the time required by other techniques. Results are provided on an outdoor path planning application.
5834868425ff05a97b00e01a	As agents populate Cyberspace in their many guises and roles, they coordinate and interact in different ways, spanning self-interested, as well as collaborative interactions. Agent coordination should be supported by an agent's internal architecture and agent societal frameworks. We take a micro-economic view of coordination. In this talk we report on our work on adaptive agent architecture and the primitive agent behaviors it supports, agent organizations, contracting protocols among agents and presence of middle agents.

Our goal is to be one of the CLEF participants who show that the hypothetical performance drop is not large enough to justify the loss of control and transparency, especially for research systems. We participated in two bilingual runs and the small multilingual run using software and data that are free to obtain, transparent and modifiable.
5834868425ff05a97b00e047	In modern financial markets, the importance of trade execution cannot be overestimated. Due to intense competition for profit opportunities, trading costs can represent a significant portion of overall returns and thus must be taken into account both when a specific trade is being executed and when a general investment strategy is being designed.
5834868425ff05a97b00d8fe	This paper presents the techniques that we have been developing recently to solve the problem of path clearance. In the path clearance problem the robot needs to reach its goal as quickly as possible without being detected by enemies. The problem is complicated by the fact that the robot does not know the precise locations of enemies, but has a list of their possible locations. Either the robot itself or scout robots can be used to sense these possible enemy locations before the robot traverses through them on the way to its goal.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4a1	Multi-State Time Delay Neural Networks (MS-TDNNs), using a new connectionist architecture with embedded time alignethem. have been successfully applied to speaker-dependent continuous spoken letter recognitionllj. This shows the value of extending the classiﬁcation capabilities of connectionist networks up to the word level in recognizing confusable vocabu-laries. This paper describes the application of MS-TDNNs to a very different task: speaker independent telephone-quality iso-lated digit recognition.
5834868425ff05a97b00d462	Plan execution is a cornerstone of spacecraft operations, irrespective of whether the plans to be executed are generated on board the spacecraft or on the ground. Plan execution frameworks vary greatly, due to both different capabilities of the execution systems, and relations to associated decision-making frameworks. The latter dependency has made the reuse of execution and planning frameworks more difficult, and has all but precluded information sharing between different execution and decision-making systems.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4bf	In the software architecture education session, we discussed four main issues: how to make a software architecture course sufficiently realistic, how to teach non-technical competencies of software architects, the place of such a course in a university curriculum, and how to grow software architects beyond the university. The session resulted in a first sketch of software architecture knowledge areas, and the extent to which these are deemed required for certain classes of software professionals.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4cb	A number of recent research efforts have been based on the hypothesis that encapsulation techniques, formal specification, and verification lead to significant improvements in program quality. As we gain experience with the language facilities produced by this research, we should attempt to validate that hypothesis. This paper poses this validation as the next major task in this area and outlines some ways to address it.

5834868425ff05a97b00d7ae	We investigate a divide-and-conquer technique in multidimensional space which decomposes a geometric problem on N points in k dimensions into two problems on N/2 points in k dimensions plus a single problem on N points in k− 1 dimension. Special structure of the subproblems is exploited to obtain an algorithm for finding the two closest of N points in 0 (N log N) time in any dimension. Related results are discussed, along with some conjectures and unsolved geometric problems.

Die Erkennungsleistung auf dem verwendeten Testdatensatz konnte nur unwesentlich verbessert werden. Die unterschiedlichen Ergebnisse werden dargestellt und analysiert. Aus der Analyse werden weitere Möglichkeiten zur Verbesserung der Erkennungsleistung abgeleitet.
5834868425ff05a97b00d7b3	Egyptian and Greek geometry were masterpieces of applied mathematics. The original motivation for geometric problems was the need to tax lands accurately and fairly and to erect buildings. As often happens, the mathematics that developed had permanence and significance that far transcend the Pharaoh's original revenue problem, for Geometry is at the heart of mathematical thinking. It is a field in which intuition abounds and new discoveries are within the compass (so to speak) of nonspecialists.
5834868425ff05a97b00db78	Model selection in support vector machines is usually carried out by minimizing the quotient of the radius of the smallest enclosing sphere of the data and the observed margin on the training set. We provide a new criterion taking the distribution within that sphere into account by considering the eigenvalue distribution of the Gram matrix of the data. Experimental results on real world data show that this new criterion provides a good prediction of the shape of the curve relating generalization error to kernel width.
5834868425ff05a97b00e03f	The behavior synthesis problem is a design task that involves the combining of several parts of known artifacts to create a new artifact which delivers a specified behavior. In this paper we build upon an earlier approach for the synthesis of designs with continuous behavior, and discuss its extension to multi-state devices with behavior that is dynamic, intermittent and have feedback.
5834868425ff05a97b00d7de	What is the relationship between home foreclosures and violent crime 8, 11? It might be surprising at first to consider that simply estimating a meaningful measure of association, given two spatiotemporal point patterns, is non-trivial. We illustrate this point in Figure 1: in the left panel, we have plotted the time series of weekly violent crime and calls to Chicago's 311 non-emergency services number about vacant/abandoned buildings (vacant buildings were highlighted as a possible mediator of the link between foreclosures and crime in 8).
5834868425ff05a97b00cfb3	Transient use of displays by mobile users was prophesied two decades ago. Today, convergence of a range of technologies enable the realization of this vision. For researchers in this space, one key question is where to physically locate the application for which the display has been appropriated. The emergence of cloud and cloudlet computing has increased the range of possible locations. In this paper we focus on understanding the extent to which application location impacts user experience when appropriating displays.

Большинство работ принимает, что робот имеет полную и точную модель среды прежде, чем это начинает двигаться; меньшее количество внимания было уделено проблеме частично известного окружения. Это ситуация возникает для зондирующего робота или того, который должен двигаться к конечное расположение без карты ландшафта.
5834868425ff05a97b00e158	In this paper, we apply an evolutionary algorithm to learning behavior on a novel, interesting task to explore the general issue of learning effective behaviors in a complex environment that provides only limited perception and goal-feedback. Our specific approach evolves behavior in the form Artificial Neural Networks with recurrent connections. We apply our approach to learn effective behavior for a non-standard maze-navigation problem that is characterized by aspects of problems that are difficult to approach via other methods.
5834868525ff05a97b00f178	Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is an important tropical fruit tree crop. Accurate varietal identification is essential for germplasm management and breeding. Using longan transcriptome sequences from public databases, we developed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers; validated 60 SNPs in 50 longan germplasm accessions, including cultivated varieties and wild germplasm; and designated 25 SNP markers that unambiguously identified all tested longan varieties with high statistical rigor (P< 0.0001).
5834868425ff05a97b00e1af	The DARPA Agent Markup Language ontology for Services (DAML-S) enables the description of Web-based services, such that they can be discovered, accessed and composed dynamically by intelligent software agents and other Web services, thereby facilitating the coordination between distributed, heterogeneous systems on the Web. We propose a formalised syntax and an initial reference semantics for DAML-S.
5834868425ff05a97b00e1e5	Despite the growing number of multi-agent software systems, relatively few physical systems have adopted multi-agent systems technology. Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data.
5834868425ff05a97b00e1ea	In this paper, we apply automatic tools to the verification of interaction protocols of Web services described in OWL-S. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure that preserves the control flow and the data flow of OWL-S Process Models. The result of our work provides complete modeling and verification of OWL-S Process Models.
5834868425ff05a97b00d09c	Relative fitness is a new approach to modeling the performance of storage devices (eg, disks and RAID arrays). In contrast to a conventional model, which predicts the performance of an application's I/O on a given device, a relative fitness model predicts performance differences between devices. The result is significantly more accurate predictions.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0a0	Numeric time series data has unique storage requirements and access patterns that can benefit from specialized support, given its importance in Big Data analyses. Popular frameworks and databases focus on addressing other needs, making them a suboptimal fit. This paper describes the support needed for numeric time series, suggests an architecture for efficient time series storage, and illustrates its potential for satisfying key requirements.
5834868525ff05a97b00f0ba	The synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFS)/Co (OH) 2 nanocomposites for non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing of glucose is presented. The sensing matrix was fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of a mixture of Co (NO 3) 2 and CNFS in ethanol at 50 V for 2 min onto gold electrodes. The formed CNFS/Co (OH) 2 matrix was characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Its electrocatalytic properties towards the oxidation of glucose in 0.1 M NaOH were tested.
5834868425ff05a97b00e39e	We describe a class of simple transitive semiautomata that exhibit full exponential blow-up during deterministic simulation. For arbitrary semiautomata we show that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether the size of the accessible part of their power automata exceeds a given bound. We comment on the application of these results to the study of cellular automata.
5834868425ff05a97b00d0f1	We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly, but that a properly weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer works well with non-uniform sampling. We show that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the highly non-uniformly sampled Netflix dataset.

The rovers we consider are equipped with communication hardware that is effective only over a limited range and requires direct line of sight to function. The paper presents the algorithm used to solve this problem and some details of our implementation. We also present the results of an experimental analysis of the algorithm's performance characteristics in a simulated multi-rover environment.
5834868425ff05a97b00e3ee	Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) often define protocols—restrictions on the order of client calls to API methods. API protocols are common and difficult to follow, which has generated tremendous research into the specification and verification of protocols. However, verification techniques do little to alleviate several major challenges programmers face when using API protocols: fixing protocol violations, learning protocol rules, and finding state transitions.

5834868625ff05a97b011047	Much work on automated information filtering has been done in the TREC and TDT domains, but differences in corpora, the nature of TREC topics vs. TDT events, the constraints imposed on training and testing, and the choices of performance measures confound any meaningful comparison between these domains. We attempt to bridge the gap between them by evaluating the performance of the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classification system on the corpus and categories from one domain using the constraints of the other.

This paper investigates the usefulness of a large medical database (the Unified Medical Language System) for the translation of dialogues between doctors and patients using a statistical machine translation system. We are able to show that the extraction of a large dictionary and the usage of semantic type information to generalize the training data significantly improves the translation performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00d10a	Many existing approaches to collaborative filtering can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have very few ratings. In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically.

5834868425ff05a97b00d6c5	Body-mounted cameras are used to accurately reconstruct the motion of a subject. Outward-looking cameras are attached to the limbs of the subject, and the joint angles and root pose that define the subject's configuration are estimated through a non-linear optimization, which can incorporate image matching error and temporal continuity of motion. Instrumentation of the environment is not required, allowing for motion capture over extended areas and in outdoor settings.
5834868525ff05a97b00f447	Density ratio neighborhoods are classes of probabilities that are used in robust Bayesian inference. These classes are invariant under Bayesian updating and marginalization. This makes them computationally convenient in robust Bayesian inference. We show that this is the unique class of probabilities that has these invariance properties. Aside from its theoretical value, this result has computational implications as well.
5834868425ff05a97b00d125	We present a study involving 160 participants investigating the effect of associating professional status and ethnicity with an agent by manipulating its appearance, language, and level of education. We aim to discern perceptions of status and ethnicity with respect to participants' cultural background by inviting participants from two different cultural groups (Middle Eastern and Western) to take part in our study. Results revealed that participants' cultural background had a strong impact on their ratings of the agent and its message.
5834868425ff05a97b00d155	Most recent efforts in computer vision harness the ever increasing availability of information on the Internet. In this work, we are interested in developing a framework that automatically mines images from the Internet and develop “knowledge” from those images. We adopt CNNs to discover the high level concepts in images, and use introspection with NLP techniques to describe those concepts in words. Finally, we show that the system can successfully discover some interesting relationships between concepts.

5834868425ff05a97b00d49e	Abstract-We propose a methodology to automatically generate plans for a robot excavator like a bucket loader or a backhoe. The task is formulated as one of constrained optimization in an action space that is spanned by the parameters of a prototypical digging plan. We show how geometric and force constraints are imposed on the action space to build the set of feasible plans, and discuss methods to optimize a cost function within this set. We discuss recent simulation results that demonstrate this method in action.
5834868425ff05a97b00d4ad	This case is the focus of much of formal language theory and static program analysis, which attempt to make guarantees about programs based on the code of a system.

5834868425ff05a97b00d4c0	In this study, we report empirical results from forecasting field defect rates and predicting the number of field defects for a large commercial software system. We find that we are not able to accurately forecast field defect rates using a combined time-based and metrics-based approach, as judged by the Theil forecasting statistic. We suggest possible conditions that may have contributed to the poor results. Next, we use metrics-based approaches to predict the number of field defects within the six months after deployment.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5ac	A system (400) for positioning and navigating an autonomous vehicle (310) allows the vehicle (310) to travel between locations. Position information (432) is derived from global positioning system satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) or other sources (624) when the satellites (200, 202, 204, and 206) are not in the view of the vehicle (310). Navigation of the vehicle (310) is obtained using the position information (432), route information (414), obstacle detection and avoidance data (416), and on board vehicle data (908 and 910).
5834868425ff05a97b00d5c5	Recent omnidirectional camera designs aim a conventional camera at a mirror that expands the camera's field of view. This wide view is ideal for three-dimensional vision tasks such as motion estimation and obstacle detection, but these applications require an accurate model of the imaging process. We present a full model of the imaging process, which includes the rotation and translation between the camera and mirror, and an algorithm that determines this relative position from observations of known points in a single image.
5834868425ff05a97b00d5d8	While many multi-robot systems rely on fortuitous cooperation between agents, some tasks, such as the assembly of large structures, require tighter coordination. We present a general software architecture for coordinating heterogeneous robots that allows for both autonomy of the individual agents as well as explicit coordination. This paper presents recent results with three robots with very different configurations. Working as a team, these robots are able to per-form a high-precision docking task that none could achieve individually.

5834868425ff05a97b00e775	We present the results of an online survey of 1,221 Twitter users, comparing messages individuals regretted either saying during in-person conversations or posting on Twitter. Participants generally reported similar types of regrets in person and on Twitter. In particular, they often regretted messages that were critical of others. However, regretted messages that were cathartic/expressive or revealed too much information were reported at a higher rate for Twitter. Regretted messages on Twitter also reached broader audiences.
5834868425ff05a97b00db92	In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which kernels of dot product type k (x, y)= k (x. y) satisfy Mercer's condition and thus may be used in Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regularization Networks (RN) or Gaussian Processes (GP). In particular, we show that if the kernel is analytic (ie can be expanded in a Taylor series), all expansion coefficients have to be nonnegative. We give an explicit functional form for the feature map by calculating its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.
5834868525ff05a97b00f209	OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and laboratory characteristics of adult Japanese encephalitis (JE) patients in a JE outbreak in Yuncheng, Shanxi Province in 2006. METHOD: All the clinical data from the Second People's Hospital in Yuncheng city were analyzed, part of patients' sera and cerebrospinal fluid were tested by serology and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The majority of patients were middle-aged and elderly, 77.8%(35/45) of the total cases were more than 40 years old. Severe and fulminating type cases accounted for 60.0%(27/45).
5834868425ff05a97b00e55d	In this paper we combine the advantages of a model using global source sentence contexts, the Discriminative Word Lexicon, and neural networks. By using deep neural networks instead of the linear maximum entropy model in the Discriminative Word Lexicon models, we are able to leverage dependencies between different source words due to the non-linearity. Furthermore, the models for different target words can share parameters and therefore data sparsity problems are effectively reduced.
5834868625ff05a97b0117ff	The resolution tree problem consists of deciding whether a given sequence-like resolution refutation admits a tree structure. This paper shows the NP-completeness of both the resolution tree problem and a natural generalization of the resolution tree problem that does not involve resolution.

5834868425ff05a97b00e749	An important characteristic of a virtual human is the ability to direct its perceptual attention to entities and areas in a virtual environment in a manner that appears believable and serves a functional purpose. In this paper, we describe a perceptual attention model that mediates top-down and bottom-up attention processes of virtual humans in order for the virtual human to efficiently select important information with limited sensory capability within complex virtual environments.

5834868425ff05a97b00d730	Software designers use a variety of structural patterns to specify system architectures. These patterns, or idioms, are currently used informally and imprecisely. Nevertheless, they provide a useful, broadly shared vocabulary. In practice, a given design often relies on several patterns. The paper reviews some common architectural idioms, shows several ways in which they are used heterogeneously, and discusses the benefits of making these idioms and their combinations more explicit and precise.

This is achieved by following the behavioural framework invented by Willems, namely by comparing trajectories of states. As important special cases we recover the diffusion kernels of Kondor and Lafferty, generalised versions of directed graph kernels of Gätner, novel kernels on matrices and new similarity measures on Markov Models.

It builds a global map in real time of the lead vehicle's position based on the location and separation of the taillights in a sequence of video images. RACCOON has been integrated into a car following experiment on the CMU Navlab II, a computer-controlled HMMWV testbed. The Navlab II safely followed a lead vehicle on a winding road in light tra c at 32 km h.
5834868625ff05a97b012617	In this paper, we describe a laboratory experiment to determine whether peripheral awareness information about a remote collaborator's workload aids in timing interruptive communication. Our results indicate that a display with an abstract representation of a collaborator's workload is best in that it leads to better timing of interruptions without overwhelming the interrupter.
5834868425ff05a97b00d6d6	This paper presents a framework for the classification of feature films into genres, based on computable visual cues. The authors view the work as a step towards high-level semantic film interpretation, currently using low-level video features and knowledge of ubiquitous cinematic practices. Our current domain of study is the film preview (the commercial advertisements primarily created to attract audiences). A preview often emphasizes the theme of a film and hence provides suitable information for classification.

But the RIP assumption has leaked into regression. In this post, I'll argue that RIP is a theoretical distraction for research in regression.
5834868425ff05a97b00db9e	Incorporating invariances into a learning algorithm is a common problem in machine learning. We provide a convex formulation which can deal with arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary losses. In addition, it is a drop-in replacement for most optimization algorithms for kernels, including solvers of the SVMStruct family. The advantage of our setting is that it relies on column generation instead of modifying the underlying optimization problem directly.
5834868625ff05a97b0127b0	We present a new algorithm for transforming dependency parse trees into phrase-structure parse trees. We cast the problem as structured prediction and learn a statistical model. Our algorithm is faster than traditional phrasestructure parsing and achieves 90.4% English parsing accuracy and 82.4% Chinese parsing accuracy, near to the state of the art on both benchmarks.

This includes a derivation of the support vector optimization problem for classification and regression, the v-trick, various kernels and an overview over applications of kernel methods.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7b0	Biologically inspired robots perform many interesting and useful behaviors, but to effectively emulate their biological counterparts, robots often need to possess many degrees of freedom, complicating their mechanical design and making it difficult to apply standard control and motion planning strategies. To address this complexity, the robotics community has derived low-dimensional parameter-based controllers that naturally coordinate many degrees of freedom such as the serpenoid curves used to control snake robots.
5834868425ff05a97b00e07e	We present a model of argumentation-based deliberative dialogue for decision making in a team of agents. The model captures conflicts among agents' plans due to scheduling and causality constraints, and conflicts between actions, goals and norms. We evaluate this model in complex collaborative planning problems to assess its ability to resolve such conflicts. We show that a model grounded on appropriate argumentation schemes facilitates the sharing of relevant information about plan, goal and norm conflicts.
5834868525ff05a97b00e925	Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a persistent organic pollutant, is associated with developmental toxicity. This study investigated the mechanism of PFOA-induced developmental cardiotoxicity in chicken embryo, focusing on the interactions between developmental exposure to PFOA and the levels of l-carnitine (LC), acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) and propionyl-l-carnitine (PLC) in the heart. To evaluate the developmental cardiotoxicity, fertile chicken eggs were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 mg/kg PFOA via air cell injection.

In the contemporary Chinese cultural context, the former's prosperity and the latter's lagging behind have formed a sharp contrast. As for the study of the TV plays, the logcal starting point and classification are the basic problems in TV play studies.
5834868425ff05a97b00e1bf	We study the phenomenon of evolution of cooperation in a society of self-interested agents using repeated games in graphs. A repeated game in a graph is a multiple round game, where, in each round, an agent gains payoff by playing a game with its neighbors and updates its action (state) by using the actions and/or payoffs of its neighbors. The interaction model between the agents is a two-player, two-action (cooperate and defect) Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game (a prototypical model for interaction between self-interested agents).
5834868525ff05a97b00ea08	The passages 0 and 3 purified human bone marrow fibroblast layers (FLs) were established by long-term liquid cultures. After 12-day coculture of stromal. cell-depleted marrow cell suspensions with passage 0 FLs, 68.33+/-4.04% of the hemopoietic colonies adhered to FLs was myeloid in nature and the other 31.67+/-4.04% was erythroid. There were still CFU-E (colony forming unit-erythroid), BFU-E (burst forming unit-erythroid), and CFU-GM (colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage) among the nonadherent cells.
5834868425ff05a97b00e298	A method was developed for cutting a fabric structural member in an inflatable module, without damaging the internal structure of the module, using linear shaped charge. Lexan and magnets are used in a charge holder to precisely position the linear shaped charge over the desired cut area. Two types of charge holders have been designed, each with its own backing plate. One holder cuts fabric straps in the vertical configuration, and the other charge holder cuts fabric straps in the horizontal configuration.

First by using the new algorithm the singular point quantities are computed to get integrable conditions completely. Then all the singular points are studied and under different parameter conditions, the possible phase portraits and bifurcation cases can be given. Furthermore, the existence of all kinds of travelling wave solution and how to figure out the solutions are discussed.

In this paper we introduce and analyse a formal model of such a form of dialogue, seeing this as a necessary first step in providing software support for this kind of communication.
5834868425ff05a97b00e2f6	Argumentation is a well-studied formal model for multiagent interaction that supports exchange of information about agents' beliefs and reasons why agents hold their beliefs. We describe an argumentation engine, called ArgTrust, that we have implemented in Java, and explain how the underlying logic formalism is translated into a computational framework.

We investigate the problem of deciding whether a given configuration has a predecessor. Depending on the underlying monoid this problem is solvable in polynomial time or NP-complete. Furthermore, we study the global reversibility of cellular graph automata based on addition modulo two. We give a linear time algorithm to decide reversibility of unicyclic graphs.
5834868625ff05a97b012621	Electronic commerce has enabled a number of online pay-for-answer services. However, despite commercial interest, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how financial incentives support question asking and answering. Using 800 questions randomly selected from a pay-for-answer site, along with site usage statistics, we examined what factors impact askers' decisions to pay. We also explored how financial rewards affect answers, and if question pricing can help organize Q&A exchanges for archival purposes.

This generalizes previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings and graphs.
5834868525ff05a97b00f765	The one-shot success probability of a noisy classical channel for transmitting one classical bit is the optimal probability with which the bit can be successfully sent via a single use of the channel. Prevedel et al.[Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110505 (2011)] recently showed that for a specific channel, this quantity can be increased if the parties using the channel share an entangled quantum state. In this paper, we characterize the optimal entanglement-assisted protocols in terms of the radius of a set of operators associated with the channel.

This paper describes research to apply formal verification methods to languages used to develop autonomy software. In particular, we describe tools that automatically convert autonomy software into formal models that are then verified using model checking. This approach has been applied to MPL code for the Livingstone fault diagnosis system and to TDL task descriptions for mobile robot systems.

The dynamics of these systems is studied numerically using a Langevin description and analytically using (1) a Gaussian approximation as well as (2) a dichotomous model. The system demonstrates ordering phase transitions and multistability. That is, for a strong enough feedback it exhibits nontrivial stationary states and oscillatory states whose frequencies depend only on the mean of the time delay distribution function.

The algorithms focus on faults that cannot directly be detected from current sensor values but require inference from a sequence of time-varying sensor values. Each algorithm provides an independent improvement over the basic approach. These improvements are not mutually exclusive, and the algorithms may be combined to suit the application domain.

5834868425ff05a97b00d993	As binary classification problems are much easier to solve many techniques exist to decompose multi-class classification problems into many binary classification problems (voting, error codes, etc.). Pairwise coupling (one against one) constructs a rule for discriminating between every pair of classes and then selecting the class with the most winning two-class decisions. By using Platt's probabilities output for SVM one can get a class probability for each of the k (k− 1)/2 models created in the pairwise classification.

We have developed a family of four algorithms for correlating sparse NMR data to 3D structural models in a probabilistic framework. The first two algorithms, Nuclear Vector Replacement (N VR) and NVR via Expectation/Maximation (N VR EM), perform automated backbone resonance assignment.
5834868625ff05a97b012a02	This paper examines a simple model of how a provider ISP charges customer ISPs by assuming the provider ISP wants to maximize its revenue when customer ISPs have the possibility of setting up peering connections. It is shown that finding the optimal pricing is NP-complete, and APX-complete. Customers can respond to price in many ways, including throttling traffic as well as peering. An algorithm is studied which obtains a 1/4 approximation for a wide range of customer responses.

The amount of complexity in Scada networks coupled with lack of security has caused an urgency to upgrade existing systems to withstand hostile attacks. In our work, we dissect these large Scada networks at the protocol level on which they operate, and further dive into the packet filtering libraries that comprise the fundamental skeleton of such Scada systems.

The method considers such a task, robotic excavation, by seeking to satisfy constraints posed by the robot and the world to generate plans that optimize an arbitrary cost function. The constraints, the optimizing scheme, and preliminary simulation results are discussed.
5834868425ff05a97b00d494	Planetary rovers operate in environments where human intervention is expensive, slow, unreliable, or impossible. It is therefore essential to monitor the behavior of these robots so that contingencies may be addressed before they result in catastrophic failures. This monitoring needs to be efficient since there is limited computational power available on rovers.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9d9	Welcome to the 2015 ICCV workshop of 3D Reconstruction and Understanding with Video and Sound. We believe the availability of new types of input sensors and algorithms to process the sensor data has been the major driving factor for innovation in computer vision. With the proliferation of commodity RGBD cameras, many new techniques have been developed that take advantage of the additional depth channel for different applications, including reconstruction, segmentation, and understanding.

A second input device is positioned within the circumference of the first input device. An interface is connected to the first input device and the second input device for producing output signals responsive to the first and second input devices. A portable computer utilizing such an input device is also disclosed.
5834868525ff05a97b00f7c5	The GMM-based spectral conversion techniques were applied to emotion conversion but it was found that spectral transformation alone is not sufficient for conveying the required target emotion. In this paper, we adopt the tone nucleus model to carry the most important information of tones and represent F0 contour for Mandarin speech. And then tone nucleus part is converted to emotional speech from neutral ones. The tone nuclei variations are modeled by the classification and regression tree (CART) and dynamic programming.

5834868425ff05a97b00e5ea	Named entity extraction has been intensively investigated in the past several years. Both statistical approaches and rule-based approaches have achieved satisfactory performance for regular written/spoken language. However when applied to highly informal or ungrammatical languages, eg, meeting languages, because of the many mismatches in language genre, the performance of existing methods decreases significantly. In this paper we propose an adaptive method of named entity extraction for meeting understanding.
5834868425ff05a97b00d740	Alphard is a programming language whose goals include supporting both the development of well· structured programs and the formal verification of these programs. This paper attempts to capture the symbiotic influence of these two goals on the design of the language. To that end the language description is interleaved with the presentation of a proof technique and discussion of programming methodology. Examples to illustrate both the language and the verification technique are included.
5834868525ff05a97b00f7e3	Background: Repair of complex cranial defects is hindered by a paucity of appropriate donor tissue. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) have been shown separately to induce bone formation through physiologically distinct mechanisms and potentially improve surgical outcome for cranial defect repair by obviating the need for donor tissue. We hypothesize that a combination of BMP2 and TGFβ1 would improve calvarial defect healing by augmenting physiologic osteogenic mechanisms.
5834868425ff05a97b00e610	Current online handwriting recognition systems have very limited error recovery mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss the problem of error repair in an online handwriting interface. Based on user study of common repair patterns found in human handwriting, we propose an approach that allows users to recover from recognition errors. The basic idea is to handle the error repair at the interface level by interacting with users. The method requires few modifications on original recognition engine and imposes few restrictions on users.
5834868525ff05a97b00f7f8	This paper is concerned with the systems aspects of the Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technology, ie, the issues that deal with getting an external geometric CAD model to automatically control the physical layering fabrication process as directly as possible, regardless of the source of the model.

5834868425ff05a97b00d87d	In this paper we present a novel data structure for sparse vectors based on Cuckoo hashing. It is highly memory efficient and allows for random access at near dense vector level rates. This allows us to solve sparse l 1 programming problems exactly and without preprocessing at a cost that is identical to dense linear algebra both in terms of memory and speed. Our approach provides a feasible alternative to the hash kernel and it excels whenever exact solutions are required, such as for feature selection.
5834868525ff05a97b00f805	Solid freeform fabrication and shape deposition are rapid manufacturing processes which build parts by incremental material deposition and fusion of cross-sectional layers. In this paper, several thermal deposition processes are described for directly fabricating prototype metal shapes using robotically manipulated material deposition systems. A robotic palletizing/part transfer system is also described which integrates multiple deposition and shaping processes into a single facility for rapidly manufacturing functional shapes.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6a0	With increasing globalization, communication across language and cultural boundaries is becoming an essential requirement of doing business, delivering education, and providing public services. Due to the considerable cost of human translation services, only a small fraction of text documents and an even smaller percentage of spoken encounters, such as international meetings and conferences, are translated, with most resorting to the use of a common language (eg English) or not taking place at all.
5834868425ff05a97b00e6a5	Automatic generation of text summaries for spoken language faces the problem of containing incorrect words and passages due to speech recognition errors. This paper describes comparative experiments where passages with higher speech recognizer confidence scores are favored in the ranking process. Results show that a relative word error rate reduction of over 10% can be achieved while at the same time the accuracy of the summary improves markedly.

5834868425ff05a97b00db00	Abstract—We propose a method for learning skills by learning kinesthetic skills via trajectory optimization. We recreate demonstrations by optimizing the trajectory to be near the demonstration. We use the trajectory optimizer, TrajOpt to turn distance metrics, the Frechet and Hausdorff distances, into cost functions that penalize a trajectory from deviating from the demonstration. Using a few techniques to assist the optimization process, we are able to reliable recreate provided demonstrations.

5834868425ff05a97b00e36b	We describe a new dependency parser for English tweets, TWEEBOPARSER. The parser builds on several contributions: new syntactic annotations for a corpus of tweets (TWEEBANK), with conventions informed by the domain; adaptations to a statistical parsing algorithm; and a new approach to exploiting out-of-domain Penn Treebank data. Our experiments show that the parser achieves over 80% unlabeled attachment accuracy on our new, high-quality test set and measure the benefit of our contributions.

The TDT problem consists of three major tasks:(1) segmenting a stream of data, especially recognized speech, into distinct stories;(2) identifying those news stories that are the first to discuss a new event occurring in the news; and (3) given a small number of sample news stories about an event, finding all following stories in the stream.
5834868425ff05a97b00d6a9	Techniques are disclosed for generating a bilinear spatiotemporal basis model. A method includes the steps of predefining a trajectory basis for the bilinear spatiotemporal basis model, receiving three-dimensional spatiotemporal data for a training sequence, estimating a shape basis for the bilinear spatiotemporal basis model using the three-dimensional spatiotemporal data, and computing coefficients for the bilinear spatiotemporal basis model using the trajectory basis and the shape basis.
5834868525ff05a97b00fbfe	We studied the photodetachment of H-in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields. This system is an important model that demonstrates the effects of closed-orbits and their bifurcations on the quantum spectra. Using Poisson's summation formula, we have obtained a reduction formula that represents the cross section a sum of oscillations. The reduction formula is valid uniformly. We compare it with the predication from the closed-orbit theory.

Facial layers are generated based on the received input. The facial layers include one or more parameters extracted from the received input. A facial expression for a second character and corresponding to the facial expression of the first character is generated, based on the facial layers and without defining any spatial correspondence between the first character and the second character.
5834868525ff05a97b00f6f3	Numerous tools have been proposed to help developers fix software errors and inefficiencies. Widely-used techniques such as memory checking suffer from overheads that limit their use to pre-deployment testing, while more advanced systems have such severe performance impacts that they may require special-purpose hardware. Previous works have described hardware that can accelerate individual analyses, but such specialization stymies adoption; generalized mechanisms are more likely to be added to commercial processors.
5834868625ff05a97b01235b	We report experimental results with bearings-only and range-only Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In the former case, we give the initial results from a new method that extends optimal shape-from-motion to incorporate angular rate and linear acceleration data. In the latter case, we have formulated a version of the SLAM problem that presumes a moving sensor able to measure only range to landmarks in the environment. Experimental results for both are presented.
5834868625ff05a97b01235f	Summary Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly becoming a critical tool for growers and researchers. We describe how the technology has advanced, starting with a commercially available WSN node and pushing the technology to make the data more meaningful, actionable and to add advanced irrigation control functionality. User features such as spatial views, custom charts, real-time data access, remote access, irrigation control, alerts, and plant models help create an advanced WSN system that is user centric.

We extend the idea of sequential composition and use it to to switch between controllers in a state based manner, resulting in a globally convergent, pure feedback policy. Individual controllers in the palette are inspired by variable constraint control. We solve a vision guided unicycle navigation problem and present experimental results.
5834868625ff05a97b0123ef	Computer sensing of hand and limb motion is an important problem for applications in human computer interaction and computer graphics. We describe a framework for local trading of self occluding motion, in which one part of an object obstructs the visibility of another. Our approach uses a kinematic model to predict occlusions and windowed templates to track partially occluded objects. We present offline 3D tracking results for hand motion with significant self occlusion.

The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868425ff05a97b00d7a1	There has been much discussion in the popular press concerning the use of contemporaneous paper trails to plug various perceived security risks in electronic voting. This paper examines whether the proposed paper solutions in fact provide any greater security than properly maintained electronic records. We conclude that DRE machines pose a number of security risks but that paper records do not address them. A number of alternatives to paper trails are suggested to respond to DRE security concerns.
5834868625ff05a97b011789	Future computing environments will free the user from the constraints of the desktop. Applications for a mobile environment should take advantage of contextual information, such as position, to offer greater services to the user. In this paper, we present the Cyberguide project, in which we are building prototypes of a mobile context-aware tour guide. Knowledge of the user's current location, as well as a history of past locations, are used to provide more of the kind of services that we come to expect from a real tour guide.

5834868625ff05a97b0127aa	dReach is a bounded reachability analysis tool for nonlinear hybrid systems. It encodes reachability problems of hybrid systems to first-order formulas over real numbers, which are solved by delta-decision procedures in the SMT solver dReach.

5834868425ff05a97b00dba0	We propose a convex optimization based strategy to deal with uncertainty in the observations of a classification problem. We assume that instead of a sample (xi, yi) a distribution over (xi, yi) is specified. In particular, we derive a robust formulation when the distribution is given by a normal distribution. It leads to Second Order Cone Programming formulation. Our method is applied to the problem of missing data, where it outperforms direct imputation.
5834868525ff05a97b00f74e	The conventional definition of spin current is incomplete and unphysical in describing spin transport in systems with spin-orbit coupling. A proper and measurable spin current is established in this study, which fits well into the standard framework of near-equilibrium transport theory and has the desirable property to vanish in insulators with localized orbitals. Experimental implications of our theory are discussed.
5834868425ff05a97b00dba2	Online learning algorithms have impressive convergence properties when it comes to risk minimization and convex games on very large problems.

5834868625ff05a97b0113e5	The emergence of location-based computing promises new and compelling applications, but raises very real privacy risks. Existing approaches to privacy generally treat people as the entity of interest, often using a fidelity tradeoff to manage the costs and benefits of revealing a person's location. However, these approaches cannot be applied in some applications, as a reduction in precision can render location information useless. This is true of a category of applications that use location data collected from multiple people.

Technical and economical comparisons with electromagnet dipoles are given.
5834868425ff05a97b00dd2a	The Internet is evolving from an infrastructure that provides basic communication services into a more sophisticated infrastructure that supports a wide range of electronic services such as virtual reality games and rich multimedia retrieval services. However, this evolution is happening only slowly, in part because the communication infrastructure is too rigid.

5834868525ff05a97b00f38a	Interleukin‑21 (IL‑21) and its receptor (IL‑21R) are broadly expressed on human B cells, activated T cells and other myeloid cells. IL‑21 cooperates with IL‑6 and transforming growth factor‑β to regulate T‑cell differentiation. IL‑21‑mediated human B cell and dendritic cells differentiation requires signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and also induces B‑cell apoptosis dependents on the Toll‑like receptor signal. Recently, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that IL‑21/IL‑21R regulate angiogenesis through STAT3.

We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.

The resulting optimization problem is shown to have a semidefinite programming solution. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn the kernel for various formulations of machine learning problems. Specifically, we provide mathematical programming formulations and experimental results for the CSVM, ν-SVM and Lagrangian SVM for classification on UCI data, and novelty detection.

We provide a regularization-theoretic analysis of this approach and extend the set of kernels to a class of natural kernels, all based on generative models with density p (xj), like the original Fisher kernel. This allows us to incorporate distribution dependent smoothness criteria in a general way. As a result of this analyis we show that the Fisher kernel corresponds to a L2 (p) norm regularization.

The nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite particles exhibit substantially superior cell transformation abilities as compared to known and commercially-available calcium phosphate kits. The nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite particles also find use in tissue engineering applications, for example bone and tooth engineering and repair applications.
5834868425ff05a97b00d9fb	Projection-based products are becoming a competitive alternative for HDTV display. It is often impractical to orient a projector perpendicularly to the screen. However, oblique projection geometry is a major factor in display luminance non-uniformity. Feedback from an arbitrarily-positioned camera is used to find homography transformations between projector and screen. From this we determine the ratio of pixel areas to flatten the illumination field.

5834868425ff05a97b00d6fa	The design of the Alphard programming language has been strongly influenced by ideas from the areas of programming methodology and formal program verification. In this paper we design, implement, and verify a general symbol table mechanism. This example is rich enough to allow us to illustrate the use as well as the definition of programmer-defined abstractions. The verification illustrates the power of the form to simplify proofs by providing strong specifications of such abstractions.
5834868625ff05a97b011906	This paper describes a novel approach to authoring multimedia documents based on the walk-through paradigm. Using this approach, multimedia authoring tasks can be performed in the context of the multimedia presentation under construction. It greatly simplifies the authoring process by hiding the use of composition constructs and eliminating the turn-around time from the editing and testing parts of the development cycle. End user multimedia authoring and fast prototyping can therefore be realized.
5834868525ff05a97b00f2ff	The electron-phonon scattering rate due to the deformation potential is calculated in a semiconductor quantum well structure, in which the electron effective mass mismatch is taken into account. By comparison with the scattering rates calculated by the infinitely high model and the finitely high square quantum well model without the electron effective mass mismatch, it is shown that the scattering rate decreases owing to the effect of the electron effective mass mismatch.
5834868525ff05a97b00f329	This vignette reviews some issues in the Foundations of Statistics. Our review is very selective, with particular emphasis on the role of the likelihood and conditioning. Specifically, we review the likelihood principle, conditional inference and coherence arguments. We close with a brief look at some modern theory which examines the role of the likelihood principle in nonparametric problems.
5834868625ff05a97b01286b	Administrators in Wikipedia differ from regular editors in two main ways. First, they have additional tools for page deletion and user maintenance, and thus have additional powers over the encyclopedia's content and community. Regular editors request assistance from admins at a public noticeboard 3 for such issues as vandalism, page protection, inappropriate usernames, conflict between users and page deletion. Second, administrators have elevated social status, as trusted editors who understand policy and its application.
5834868425ff05a97b00db7d	This paper presents an algorithm to estimate simultaneously both mean and variance of a non parametric regression problem. The key point is that we are able to estimate variance locally unlike standard Gaussian Process regression or SVMs. This means that our estimator adapts to the local noise. The problem is cast in the setting of maximum a posteriori estimation in exponential families. Unlike previous work, we obtain a convex optimization problem which can be solved via Newton's method.
5834868625ff05a97b01147f	We have assembled a wide spectral range, allelectronic spectro-polarimetric imager utilizing an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF), a liquid crystal variable retardation plate, and real-time, softwareadaptable signature masks. This combination of rapidly adjustable parameters allows operation at 30/sec. frame rate, and near real time adaptability to changing target signatures. The spectral capability of the AOTF permits us to apply simultaneous, multiple wavelength filtering which greatly increases selectivity.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc16	This paper explores the concept of early discard for interactive search of unindexed data. Processing data inside storage devices using downloaded searchlet code enables Diamond to perform efficient, application-specific filtering of large data collections. Early discard helps users who are looking for``needles in a haystack''by eliminating the bulk of the irrelevant items as early as possible. A searchlet consists of a set of application-generated filters that Diamond uses to determine whether an object may be of interest to the user.
5834868625ff05a97b0114a9	Texts are replete with gaps, information omitted since authors assume a certain amount of background knowledge. We define the process of enrichment that fills these gaps. We describe how enrichment can be performed using a Background Knowledge Base built from a large corpus. We evaluate the effectiveness of various openly available background knowledge bases and we identify the kind of information necessary for enrichment.
5834868625ff05a97b0114b3	We present a framework for handling emotional variations in a speech-based natural language system for use in the MRE virtual training environment. The system is a first step toward addressing issues in emotion-based modeling of verbal communicative behavior. We cast the problem of emotional generation as a distance minimization task, in which the system chooses between multiple valid realizations for a given input based on the emotional distance of each realization from the speaker's attitude toward that input.

5834868525ff05a97b00f772	Many implementations of research techniques that automatically repair software bugs target programs written in C. Work that targets Java often begins from or compares to direct translations of such techniques to a Java context. However, Java and C are very different languages, and Java should be studied to inform the construction of repair approaches to target it. We conduct a large-scale study of bug-fixing commits in Java projects, focusing on assumptions underlying common search-based repair approaches.
5834868425ff05a97b00e599	A novel connectionist system for dialog processing is described. Based on a script-like formalism, the system consists of several modular neural networks which can track the semantic flow of a dialog. The system can be extended to understand and translate dialogs in a certain domain.
5834868425ff05a97b00da09	Determining the motion consistency between two video clips is a key component for many applications such as video event detection and human pose estimation. Shechtman and Irani recently proposed a method for measuring the motion consistency between two videos by representing the motion about each point with a space-time Harris matrix of spatial and temporal derivatives. A motion-consistency measure can be accurately estimated without explicitly calculating the optical flow from the videos, which could be noisy.
5834868525ff05a97b00f85b	This letter provides an overview of our recent work studying the impacts of price competition and congestion in the cloud marketplace. Specifically, we discuss a three-tier market model that studies a vertical marketplace where users purchase services from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, which in turn purchase computing resources from either Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers.
5834868425ff05a97b00e693	Identifying human gaze or eye-movement ultimately serves the purpose of identifying an individual's focus of attention. The knowledge of a person's object of interest helps us effectively communicate with other humans by allowing us to identify our conversants' interests, state of mind, and/or intentions. In this paper we propose to track focus of attention of several participants in a meeting. Attention does not necessarily coincide with gaze, as it is a perceptual variable, as opposed to a physical one (eye or head positioning).
5834868625ff05a97b0116d0	Since MT systems, whatever translation method they employ, do not reach an optimum output on free text; each method handles some problems better than others. The PANGLOSS Mark III system is an MT environment that uses the best results from a variety of independent MT systems or engines working simultaneously within a single framework on the same text. This paper describes the method used to combine the outputs of the engines into a single text.
5834868525ff05a97b00f68f	In this paper, we explore student dropout behavior in a Massively Open Online Course (MOOC). We use a survival model to measure the impact of three social factors that make predictions about attrition along the way for students who have participated in the course discussion forum.
5834868625ff05a97b0114c2	Despite considerable theoretical and computational work on coreference, deciding when two entities or events are identical is very difficult. In a project to build corpora containing coreference links between events, we have identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none). Event coreference annotation on two corpora was performed to validate the findings.
5834868425ff05a97b00dd46	The factors that motivated the choice of a reduced-instruction-set computer (RISC) on which to implement Lisp are examined. Dynamic profiling measurements used to characterise Lisp are reported. The implementation of tags in Lisp and the cost of function calls are discussed. Interprocedural register allocation is examined. Execution results for various benchmarks are presented and discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b0114e0	This paper addresses the methodology of ontology construction. It identifies five styles of approach to ontologizing (deriving from philosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, AI/computational linguistics, and domain reasoning) and argues that they do not provide the same results. It then provides a more detailed example of one of the approaches.
5834868525ff05a97b00f696	We present a query-focused summarization framework to extract salient information for the PoliInformatics unshared task according to user-specified queries. Our system calculates sentence importance based on word frequency, speaker expertise, and topic relevance. Temporal changes in topic and speaker importance can be identified with our system summaries.

Dies ist heutzutage sehr wohl mit auf diesen Geräuschumgebungen trainierten Spracherkennern möglich. Leider gibt es manche Anwendungen, in denen die Kosten ein Training mit originalen geräuschbehafteten Daten unmöglich machen, so dass auf Akustiken reiner Sprache zurückgegriffen werden muss.
5834868625ff05a97b011702	In this paper, we introduce a methodology for analyzing judgment opinions. We define a judgment opinion as consisting of a valence, a holder, and a topic. We decompose the task of opinion analysis into four parts: 1) recognizing the opinion; 2) identifying the valence; 3) identifying the holder; and 4) identifying the topic. In this paper, we address the first three parts and evaluate our methodology using both intrinsic and extrinsic measures.
5834868525ff05a97b00f6b5	抄録 This paper investigates an applicability of the discrete action set DCOB proposed by Yamaguchi et al. to motion acquisition task of an actual small size multi-link robot by reinforcement learning. We apply the DCOB to a crawling task of a spider robot (ROBOTIS Bioloid), and compare the DCOB with a grid action set as a conventional method. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the DCOB both in learning speed and ability to acquire performance.
5834868425ff05a97b00db89	Many settings of unsupervised learning can be viewed as quantization problems—the minimization of the expected quantization error subject to some restrictions. This allows the use of tools such as regularization from the theory of (supervised) risk minimization for unsupervised settings. Moreover, this setting is very closely related to both principal curves and the generative topographic map. We explore this connection in two ways: 1) we propose an algorithm for finding principal manifolds that can be regularized in a variety of ways.
5834868425ff05a97b00e546	The February, 1992 NSF Workshop on Spoken Language Understanding brought together scientists from a number of disciplines to identify research directions needed to produce spoken language systems. This report describes the key research topics, the expected benefits of the research, and recommendations to NSF on the infrastructure needed to support the research.

In each issue of Communications, we'll publish selected posts or excerpts. twitterFollow us on Twitter at http://twitter. com/blogCACMhttp://cacm. acm. org/blogs/blog-cacmJason Hong wonders whether computer security is missing the mark, while Judy Robertson supports refusing to tolerate discourtesy.
5834868625ff05a97b011504	Abstract—Privacy and security issues might very well be the greatest barrier to creating a ubiquitously connected world. The articles in this special issue show that addressing such concerns will require not only efficient algorithms and secure protocols but also usable interfaces and socially compatible designs. Furthermore, researchers with a strong interdisciplinary interest will need to look for the non-obvious solutions.

5834868625ff05a97b011527	A context-aware training system senses a user action that may expose the user to a threat, such as a cybersecurity threat. The system selects a training action from a collection of available training actions and causes the training action to be delivered to the user or a group of users. The system includes an administrator interface that enables an administrator to select, customize and/or assign constraints to the training action that will be delivered to the user (s).
5834868425ff05a97b00db8d	Novelty detection is an important tool for unsupervised data analysis. It relies on finding regions of low density within which events are then flagged as novel. By design this is dependent on the underlying measure of the space. In this paper we derive a formulation which is able to address this problem by allowing for a reference measure to be given in the form of a sample from an alternative distribution. We show that this optimization problem can be solved efficiently and that it works well in practice.
5834868525ff05a97b00f6c2	We investigate a real robot applicability of our method, general-purpose behavior-learning for high degree-of-freedom robots in varying environments. Our method is based on the learning strategy fusion proposed in [Yamaguchi et al. 2011], and extended theoretically in [Yamaguchi et al. 2013]. This report discusses its applicability to real robot systems, and demonstrates some positive experimental results.
5834868425ff05a97b00dbb1	Background Analogous to genomic sequence alignment, biological network alignment identifies conserved regions between networks of different species. Then, function can be transferred from well-to poorly-annotated species between aligned network regions. Network alignment typically encompasses two algorithmic components: node cost function (NCF), which measures similarities between nodes in different networks, and alignment strategy (AS), which uses these similarities to rapidly identify high-scoring alignments.
5834868425ff05a97b00db43	We describe a probabilistic model for utilizing passthrough information for producing 3D geometry models from a rotating laser scanner. Our method is fast, performs particularly well with relatively sparse data, is robust to noise of the depth data and naturally handles grazing points. We demonstrate our results on the HERB platform where the robot automatically builds a watertight 3D model of an object it is handed.
5834868425ff05a97b00e692	This paper reports an automatic speech summarization method and experimental results using English broadcast news speech. In our proposed method, a set of words maximizing a summarization score indicating an appropriateness of summarization is extracted from automatically transcribed speech. This extraction is performed using a Dynamic Programming (DP) technique according to a target compression ratio. We have previously tested the performance of our method using Japanese broadcast news speech.
5834868625ff05a97b011535	A training system senses a user action that may expose the user to a threat, such as a cybersecurity threat. The user action may be in response to a mock attack delivered via a messaging service, a wireless communication service, a fake malware application or another device, service, system or mechanism. The system selects a training action from a collection of available training actions and causes the training action to be delivered to the user.
5834868425ff05a97b00e787	We introduce QVEC-CCA--an intrinsic evaluation metric for word vector representations based on correlations of learned vectors with features extracted from linguistic resources. We show that QVEC-CCA scores are an effective proxy for a range of extrinsic semantic and syntactic tasks. We also show that the proposed evaluation obtains higher and more consistent correlations with downstream tasks, compared to existing approaches to intrinsic evaluation of word vectors that are based on word similarity.
5834868625ff05a97b0113c6	Translation systems tend to have more trouble with long sentences than with short ones for a variety of reasons. When the source and target languages differ rather markedly, as do Japanese and English, this problem is reflected in lower quality output. To improve readability, we experimented with automatically splitting long sentences into shorter ones. This paper outlines the problem, describes the sentence splitting procedure and rules, and provides an evaluation of the results.
5834868625ff05a97b0113d5	This was the second year of the C@ merata task [16, 1] which relates natural language processing to music inform ation retrieval. Participants each build a system which takes as input a query and a music score and produces as output one or more ma tching passages in the score. This year, questions were mo re difficult and scores were more complex. Participants were the same as last year and once again CLAS was the best with a Beat F-Score of 0.620.
5834868625ff05a97b01141b	Empirical evidence from past studies has shown that current location-based services (LBSs) are not individually compelling enough to drive LBS adoption. To boost the adoption rate, researchers should consider an under-explored research area: the time dimension of location information. We provide examples of such LBSs that share past and future locations. We also describe several challenges for designing these types of LBSs.

5834868425ff05a97b00dfdf	In this report, we first discuss the modeling context that is suitable for the multi-attribute negotiations in the Navy detailing process. Then, we present the model based on a novel negotiation protocol for automated multi-attribute negotiations. The negotiation algorithm, negotiation strategies and the mediator's problem are included in this model. Based on the discussions in this report, we conclude that our model is distributed, Pareto-efficient and tractable.
5834868425ff05a97b00dd74	Transmission of multimedia streams imposes a minimum-bandwidth requirement on the path being used to ensure end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. While any shortest-path algorithm can be used to select a feasible path, additional constraints that limit resource consumption and balance the network load are needed to achieve efficient resource utilization. We present a systematic evaluation of four routing algorithms that offer different tradeoffs between limiting the path hop count and balancing the network load.
5834868425ff05a97b00dc7d	In this paper we address tasks for multirobot teams that require solving a distributed multi-agent planning problem in which the actions of robots are tightly coupled. The uncertainty inherent in these tasks also necessitates persistent tight coordination between teammates throughout execution. Existing approaches to coordination cannot adequately meet the technical demands of such tasks. In response, we have developed a market-based framework, Hoplites, that consists of two novel coordination mechanisms.
5834868525ff05a97b010d7f	In this paper, the system of the forced vibration ̈ T-λ _1 T+ λ _2 T^ 2+ λ _3 T^ 3= ε\\left (g\\cos ω t-ε'̇ T\\right) is discussed, which contains square and cubic items. The critical condition that the system enters chaotic states is given by the Melnikov method. By Poincar map, phase portrait and time-displacement history diagram, whether the chaos occurs is determined.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7b2	The snakeboard is a well-studied example for mechanical systems analysis, largely because of its simultaneous richness in behavior and simplicity in design. However, few snakeboard models incorporate dissipative friction in the traveling direction and skidding as a violation of the rigid nonholonomic constraints. In this paper we investigate these effects on trajectory planning by evaluating a previously proposed friction model as well as a novel skidding model based on the addition of Rayleigh dissipation functions.
5834868425ff05a97b00dd38	TCP slow start exponentially increases the congestion window size to detect the proper congestion window for a network path. This often results in significant packet loss, while breaking off slow start using a limited slow start threshold may lead to an overly conservative congestion window size. This problem is especially severe in high speed networks. In this paper we present a new TCP startup algorithm, called paced start, that incorporates an available bandwidth probing technique into the TCP startup algorithm.
5834868625ff05a97b011c2a	This paper describes the WebCLEF 2007 task. The task definition—which goes beyond traditional navigational queries and is concerned with undirected information search goals—combines insights gained at previous editions of WebCLEF and of the WiQA pilot that was run at CLEF 2006. We detail the task, the assessment procedure and the results achieved by the participants.

In the E-step, the expected value of the hidden variables zi=(zi1, zi2,... ziK) is calculated. In the M-step, the parameter {π, κ, µ={µ1, µ2,.. µK}} are optimized to maximize the likelihood.
5834868425ff05a97b00e51d	Zusammenfassung In modernen Spracherkennungssystemen mit großem Vokabular ist das Aussprachewörterbuch eine der teuersten Komponenten. Es zu erstellen, erfordert häufig linguistisches Wissen. Existierende, automatische Verfahren zur Erzeugung von phonembasierten Wörterbüchern erfordern oft eine manuelle Nachbearbeitung durch Experten. Diese manuelle Nachbearbeitung ist teuer und zeitaufwendig.
5834868625ff05a97b011f9e	Kinder unterscheiden sich in ihren Lernstrategien und im Verlauf ihrer Entwicklung. Darum kann man das Alter, in dem gewisse Entwicklungsstufen erreicht werden (zB “mit einem Jahr sprechen Kinder die ersten Worte”), immer nur als allgemeinen Durchschnitt ansehen. Somit ist es völlig normal, wenn Kinder manche Stufen ein paar Monate eher oder später erreichen. Mit diesem Wissen können wir den allgemeinen Entwicklungsverlauf auf dem Weg zu den ersten einfachen Sätzen nachvollziehen.
5834868425ff05a97b00e523	The development of a speech translation (ST) system is costly, largely because it is expensive to collect parallel data. A new language pair is typically only considered in the aftermath of an international crisis that incurs a major need of crosslingual communication. Urgency justifies the deployment of interpreters while data is being collected. In recent work, we have shown that audio recordings of interpreter-mediated communication can present a low-cost data resource for the rapid development of automatic text and speech translation.
5834868425ff05a97b00dce3	Providing drivers with comprehensive assistance systems has long been a goal for the automotive industry. The challenge is on many fronts, from building sensors, analyzing sensor data, automated understanding of traffic situations and appropriate interaction with the driver. These issues are discussed with the example of a collision warning system for transit buses.
5834868425ff05a97b00dcdb	Trust in automation plays a crucial role in human-robot interaction and usually varies during interactions. In scenarios of shared control, the ideal pattern is for the user's real-time trust in the robot to align with robot performance. This should lead to an increased overall efficiency of the system by limiting under-trust and over-trust. However, users sometimes display incorrect trust and the ability to detect and alter user trust is important. This paper describes measures for real-time trust alignment.
5834868425ff05a97b00e48a	4 Conclusion In the previous sections we showed that the ProPars system by using symbolic procedures is enabled to parse sentences of arbitrary length. In addition, symbolic procedures were used to store intermediate parsing results such that a syntax tree can be assembled after the parsing process has been completed. Both of these problems are not solved by other connectionist based systems.
5834868625ff05a97b012f1b	This paper makes the case for studying and exploiting the predictability of lock operations in multithreaded programs. We discuss several uses of lock prediction and identify the two key events we believe are useful to predict:(1) which thread will be the next one to acquire a given lock and (2) which lock a given thread will acquire next. We describe multiple prediction algorithms and show that while their accuracy varies widely, they are likely accurate enough for many uses.
5834868625ff05a97b0116c9	In this paper we describe a biography summarization system using sentence classification and ideas from information retrieval. Although the individual techniques are not new, assembling and applying them to generate multi-document biographies is new. Our system was evaluated in DUC2004. It is among the top performers in task 5-short summaries focused by person questions.
5834868625ff05a97b0116d9	In this paper we describe computational approaches to summarizing dynamically introduced information: online discussions and blogs, and their evaluations. Research in the past has been mainly focused on text-based summarization where the input data is predominantly newswire data. When branching into these newly emerged data types, we face number of difficulties that are discussed here.
5834868625ff05a97b0116e1	Semantic inference is a key component for advanced natural language understanding. However, existing collections of automatically acquired inference rules have shown disappointing results when used in applications such as textual entailment and question answering. This paper presents ISP, a collection of methods for automatically learning admissible argument values to which an inference rule can be applied, which we call inferential selectional preferences, and methods for filtering out incorrect inferences.
5834868425ff05a97b00e654	Speech recognition has advanced considerably, but has been limited almost entirely either to situations in which close speaking microphones are natural and acceptable (telephone, dictation, command&control, etc.) or in which high-quality recordings are ensured. Furthermore, most recognition applications involve controlled recording environments, in which the user turns the recognition event on and off and speaks cooperatively for the purpose of being recognized.
5834868625ff05a97b01309f	Indoor air quality (IAQ) is important for health as people spend the majority of time indoors, and it is particularly interesting over outdoor air because it strongly ties to indoor activities. Some activities easily exacerbate IAQ, resulting in serious pollution. However, people may not notice such changes because many pollutants are colorless and odorless, while many activities are inconspicuous and routine. We implemented inAir, a system that measures and visualizes IAQ that households appropriate and integrate into everyday life.
5834868625ff05a97b0130ab	Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain that is appropriate for studying a large spectrum of issues of relevance to the development of complete autonomous agents. RoboCup [1] has the Sony Legged Robot League as an international robot competition in which Sony's quadruped robot AIBO has been adopted as a hardware platform.
5834868625ff05a97b0120c7	There has been a recent push in extraction of 3D spatial layout of scenes. However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world. We show that augmenting current structured prediction techniques with volumetric reasoning significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art.
5834868425ff05a97b00e67c	This paper describes a working two-way speech-to-speech translation system that runs in near real-time on a consumer handheld computer. It can translate from English to Arabic and Arabic to English in the domain of medical interviews. We describe the general architecture and frameworks within which we developed each of the components: HMM-based recognition, interlingua translation (both rule and statistically based), and unit selection synthesis.
5834868625ff05a97b01319a	Advances in 3D sensing technologies have made the availability of RGB and Depth information easier than earlier which can greatly assist in the semantic segmentation of 2D scenes. There are many works in literature that perform semantic segmentation in such scenes, but few relates to the environment that possesses a high degree of clutter in general eg indoor scenes. In this paper, we explore the use of depth information along with RGB and deep convolutional network for indoor scene understanding through semantic labeling.

In large-scale ML problems, the parameter matrix of a MPM can grow at an unexpected rate, resulting in high communication and parameter synchronization costs. To address this issue, we offer two contributions: first, we develop a computation model for a large family of MPMs, which share the following property: the parameter update computed on each data sample is a rank-1 matrix, ie the outer product of two “sufficient factors”(SFs).
5834868425ff05a97b00e083	How to model the process of information diffusion in social networks is a critical research task. Although numerous attempts have been made for this study, few of them can simulate and predict the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. To address this problem, we propose a novel information diffusion model (GT model), which considers the users in network as intelligent agents. The agent jointly considers all his interacting neighbors and calculates the payoffs for his different choices to make strategic decision.

5834868525ff05a97b00ec1a	The paper presents a strategy to optimize various non-coplanar laminate thinwalled structures. The optimization procedure is performed at two specially constructed levels for the purposes of minimization of the total weight and maximization of the globe stiffness of the structures. The FEM is used to obtain the structural response and a search algorithm is adopted to find the optimal ply thickness and ply orientation of each lamina. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed scheme.

We present a formal model for autonomous agents to negotiate on the Internet. In our model, the negotiation process is driven by the internal beliefs of participating agents. We empirically identify the relative strength of a group of belief updating methods and show how an agent can change its behavior by adjusting some critical parameters. The advantage of our model is that it is flexible and easy to implement.

We compare the computed-torque control scheme with the feedforward dynamics compensation scheme. The feedforward scheme compensates for the manipulator dynamics in the feedforward path while the computed-torque scheme uses the dynamics in the feedback loop for linearization and decoupling. The manipulator control schemes have been implemented on the CMU DD Arm II with a sampling period of 2 ms.

This leads to a modification of the phase-space density of states, whose significance is discussed in a number of examples: field modification of the Fermi-sea volume, connection to the anomalous Hall effect, and a general formula for orbital magnetization. The effective quantum mechanics of Bloch electrons is also sketched, where the modified density of states plays an essential role.
5834868625ff05a97b011dda	The complete set of measurements that could ever be used by a passive 3D vision algorithm is the plenoptic function or light-field. We give a concise characterization of when the light-field of a Lambertian scene uniquely determines its shape and, conversely, when the shape is inherently ambiguous. In particular, we show that stereo computed from the light-field is ambiguous if and only if the scene is radiating light of a constant intensity (and color, etc.) over an extended region.

5834868425ff05a97b00e30f	We present and evaluate an approach to hybrid semantic Web service matching, called OWLS-MX, that utilizes both logic based reasoning and content based information retrieval techniques for services specified in OWL-S. Results of our comparative measurements of performance and scalability of OWLS-MX variants and selected token-based IR similarity metrics provide experimental evidence that building semantic Web service matchmakers purely on description logic reasoners artificially limits their potential.

5834868425ff05a97b00e334	Abstract—Mechanisms for Web services Discovery proposed so far have assumed a centralized registry that collects information about all the Web services available at any given time. Centralized registries are performance bottlenecks and may result in single points of failure. In this paper, we propose an alternative architecture based on a P2P connection between Web services and we show how to perform capability matching between Web services on the Gnutella network.

5834868425ff05a97b00dcd1	Many mobile applications rely on location information gained from location services on mobile devices. However, continuously tracking the device location with high accuracy drains the battery quickly. Furthermore, sensing the same location can be redundant when multiple devices are co-located. In this paper, we develop a crowdsourcing-based location service, E2A2 (energy efficient and accuracy aware), which places colo-cated devices into groups, and uses group location to represent individual device location.

5834868425ff05a97b00e40d	This paper proposes a novel video text detection method based on the key text points. For text detection, the keyframes is decomposed by wavelet transform. The key text points (KTPs) are determined by three resulting high-frequency subbands, and merged by the morphological operations. The anti-texture-direction-projection method is proposed for text line localization and verification. A fast text tracking scheme is proposed, in which text detection is only implemented on the first keyframe of an identical text line in the duration.

5834868625ff05a97b011580	This passive flexure mechanism provides, to a robot having parallel grippers, a precise control of grip force by a parallel flexure assembly. Control of grip force is by controllable stops which stop the application of additional force at a known point; the actual force applied by the gripper is a function of the relative position of the stops, the size of the object gripped, and the flexure of the assembly.
5834868625ff05a97b0116dc	ParaEval is an automated evaluation method for comparing reference and peer summaries. It facilitates a tiered-comparison strategy where recall-oriented global optimal and local greedy searches for paraphrase matching are enabled in the top tiers. We utilize a domain-independent paraphrase table extracted from a large bilingual parallel corpus using methods from Machine Translation (MT). We show that the quality of ParaEval's evaluations, measured by correlating with human judgments, closely resembles that of ROUGE's.

We begin by discussing the need for a toolkit of HRI metrics. We then describe the framework of our work and identify important biasing factors that must be taken into consideration. Finally, we present preliminary results, including a summary of task-specific metrics already in use and suggested common metrics for standardization. Preparation of a larger, more detailed HRI metric toolkit is in progress.
5834868625ff05a97b011735	In this paper, we present data from 31 semi-structured interviews with anti-phishing experts from academia, law enforcement, and industry.

Our findings describe the evolving phishing threat, stakeholder incentives to devote resources to anti-phishing efforts, what stakeholders should do to most effectively address the problem, and the role of education and law enforcement.
5834868425ff05a97b00e663	In this paper, we propose a robust approach for recognition of text embedded in natural scenes. Instead of using binary information as most other OCR systems do, we extract features from intensity of an image directly. We utilize a local intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations. We then employ Gabor transform to obtain local features, and use the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for selection and classification of features. The proposed method has been applied to a Chinese sign recognition task.
5834868525ff05a97b00f0ae	Background: Daclatasvir (DCV) is a first-in-class HCV NS5A inhibitor with pan-genotypic coverage in vitro. In this study, treatment-naive HCV genotype (GT) 4-infected patients received DCV (20mg or 60mg QD) plus peginterferon-alfa-2a/ribavirin (alfa/RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in a response-guided design. SVR12 (HCV RNA< 25 IU/mL 12 weeks posttreatment) was achieved by 8/12 (67%) and 12/12 (100%) 20mg and 60mg recipients, respectively. We report the NS5A resistance profile through 48 weeks posttreatment.

We also discuss the JANUS-3 toolkit and how it can be applied on our way towards multilinguality using the GlobalPhone database.
5834868525ff05a97b00f0c1	Adaptive digital f ilters have been shown to be useful in reducing the power of harmonic noise in distribution line communication systems. Many DLC systems currently in use employ hard limiters to reduce this type of noise prior to detection of the signal. This research shows that the adaptive noise cancellation filter can be used effectively in tandem with hard limiters. The optimal, limit of the limiter is determined in the cases of the presence and absence of the adaptive noise canceller.
5834868625ff05a97b013211	Sensor dependency is an affliction that affects an alarming number of robots, and the problem is spreading. In some situations, sensor use is advisable, perhaps even unavoidable. However, there is an important difference between sensor use and sensor abuse.

5834868625ff05a97b0122cb	Direct modeling has recently emerged as a suitable approach for 3D free-form shape modeling in industrial design. It has several advantages over the conventional, parametric modeling techniques, including natural user interactions, as well as the underlying, automatic feature-preserving shape deformation algorithms. However, current direct modeling packages still lack several capabilities critical for product design, such as managing aesthetic design intentions, and enforcing dimensional, geometric constraints.

5834868625ff05a97b013252	Since the publication of the human genome in 2001, the price and the time of DNA sequencing have dropped dramatically. The genome of many more species have since been sequenced, and genome sequencing is an ever more important tool for biologists. This trend will likely revolutionize biology and medicine in the near future where the genome sequence of each individual person, instead of a model genome for the human, becomes readily accessible.
5834868625ff05a97b01326d	Socioeconomic factors play an important but largely hidden role in home-energy \nconsumption. Most studies have targeted single-family, affluent households—so the resulting \nenergy-monitoring systems do not address the needs of renters and low-income individuals. \nFor technology designers and information architects, failure to address the disparity in the use \nof home-energy devices can no longer be set aside. Lack of access to energy information leaves \nthree out of 10 US households without the power to make changes in consumption.
5834868625ff05a97b012311	We prove that no recursive function can upper bound the increase in the size of description when a two-way deterministic finite automaton with k+ 1 heads is replaced by an equivalent two-way deterministic finite automaton with k heads. This is true for all k, and remains true if the automata are unary and/or nondeterministic.
5834868625ff05a97b011069	This paper studies the effects of boosting in the context of different classification methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classifier. We identify the inductive biases of each classifier and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not effective in improving the performance of the base classifiers on common categories.
5834868625ff05a97b0121bb	This report examines the general problem of high speed autonomous navigation from range image data as it applies to both stereo and lidar sensing systems.

The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868625ff05a97b0121d3	The related fields of mobile robotics and ground vehicle localization lack a linearized theory of odometry error propagation. By contrast, the equivalent Schuler dynamics which apply to inertial guidance have been known and exploited for decades. In this paper, the general solution of linearized propagation dynamics of both systematic and random errors for vehicle odometry is developed and validated. The associated integral transforms are applied to the task of eliciting the major dynamic behaviors of errors for several forms of odometry.
5834868525ff05a97b00f76e	In this work, we present the first local-decoding algorithm for expander codes. This yields a new family of constant-rate codes that can recover from a constant fraction of errors in the codeword symbols, and where any symbol of the codeword can be recovered with high probability by reading N ε N ε symbols from the corrupted codeword, where N is the block-length of the code.
5834868625ff05a97b013336	Several studies have used magnetoencephalography to investigate how the human brain processes language and recognizes objects. This work follows the footsteps of the encouraging results obtained by this group using fMRI to predict brain activity associated with the meaning of nouns. Here, we leverage the superior temporal resolution of MEG data to analyze the spatiotemporal activation following the presentation of concrete nouns, and then decode the different nouns presented to the subject during the recording session.
5834868625ff05a97b01236f	This paper presents a hybrid localization scheme for a mobile robot using the hierarchical atlas. The hierarchical atlas is a map that consists of a higher level topological graph with lower level feature-based metric submaps associated with the graph edges. Our method employs both a discrete Bayes filter and a Kalman filter to localize the robot in the map. This framework accommodates localization in a map with no prior information (global localization) and localization in a map with an incorrect pose estimate (kidnapped robot).

We explore uncertaintybased active learning with the CRF model to dynamically select the most informative training examples. This abridges the power of the supervised methods and expensive human annotation cost.
5834868625ff05a97b011326	Random walks is one of the most popular ideas in computer science. A critical assumption in random walks is that the probability of the walk being at a given vertex at a time instance converges to a limit independent of the start state. While this makes it computationally efficient to solve, it limits their use to incorporate label information. In this paper, we exploit the connection between Random Walks and Electrical Networks to incorporate label information in classification, ranking, and seed expansion.

Using databases logged by Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor, we illustrate how to specify phenomena to investigate, explore events and the context where they occurred, dynamically drill down and adjust which details to display, and summarize events in human-understandable form. The tool should apply to MySQL databases from other tutors as well.
5834868625ff05a97b0134db	This paper describes an implemented method to generalize an example tutor interaction into a query to retrieve similarly related sets of events. It infers WHERE clauses to equate repeated values unlikely to match by accident. The Session Browser [1] shown in Figure 1 is an EDM tool to view data retrieved by querying a database of events logged by a tutor. It displays retrieved events in a context tree of enclosing events, with a 1-line summary of the database record for each event.

The coach provides a combination of reading and listening, in which the child reads wherever possible, and the coach helps wherever necessary. We demonstrated a prototype of this coach at the ARPA Workshop on Human Language Technology in March 1994. A short video shows the coach in action [1].

5834868625ff05a97b013586	Ingcreasingly, data-mining algorithms must deal with databases that continuously grow over time. These algorithms must avoid repeatedly scanning their databases. When database attributes are symbolic, ADtrees have already shown to be efficient structures to store sufficient statistics in main memory and to accelerate the mining process in batch environments. Here we present an efficient method to sequentially update ADtrees that is suitable for incremental environments.

We have been exploring factors in tangible games that may contribute to both learning and enjoyment with an eye toward technological feasibility and scalability. Previous research found that young children learned early physics principles better when interactively predicting and observing experimental comparisons on a physical earthquake table than when seeing a video of the same.

METHODS: BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow of the posterior iliac crest of a 6-month old sheep by whole marrow adherent culture method. The 3rd passage BMSCs were seeded onto modified PHBV and conventional PHBV films, or three-dimension scaffolds. Cell-adhesion rates were calculated by hemocytometer at 1, 2 and 6 hours after seeded.
5834868625ff05a97b01223f	Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a paradigm that incorporates programming language technology, program generation techniques, and stepwise refinement. In their GPCE'07 paper, Thaker et al. suggest the development of a type system for FOP to guarantee safe feature composition, ie, to guarantee the absence of type errors during feature composition. We present such a type system along with a calculus for a simple feature-oriented, Java-like language, called Feature Featherweight Java (FFJ).
5834868525ff05a97b010c14	Abstract% Zooplankton is one of the most important components in lake ecosystems. The zooplankton abundance and PO4 r P released by zooplankton community in Meiliang Bay and Lake Wuli $ Lake Taihu were studied from March to May in 2004.

5834868425ff05a97b00e6d0	People are polite to their computers. They are flattered by them, form teams with them and even interact emotionally with them. In their experiments, Reeves and Nass (The Media Equation, 1996) showed that humans impose their interpersonal behavioral patterns onto their computers. Thus, the design of humancomputer interfaces should reflect this observation in order to facilitate an effective communication.
5834868525ff05a97b010f37	Frequency domain phase-resolved optical Doppler tomography (ODT) was developed with Doppler variance imaging capability. It is shown that utilizing the frequency domain method, phase-resolved ODT can achieve much higher imaging speed and velocity dynamic range than the time domain method. Structural, Doppler and Doppler variance images of fluid flow through glass channels were quantified and blood flow through vessels were demonstrated in vivo.
5834868625ff05a97b01240c	Inferring scene geometry and camera motion from a stream of images is possible in principle, but is an ill-conditioned problem when the objects are distant with respect to their size. We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step.
5834868525ff05a97b00f2d3	Valvular heart diseases are recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Accurate quantification of cardiac flow volumes in patients is essential in evaluation of the progression of the disease and in determination of clinical options. Recent advances in the real-time 3D full volume echocardiography have enabled high frame rate acquisition of volumetric color Doppler flow images. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to quantify the cardiac flow using instantaneous 3D+ t ultrasound data.

The user's head orientation is tracked and mapped so as to move the viewpoint of the user about the surface of a virtual sphere surrounding a center of rotation. The technique is useful for object examination tasks in a virtual world, allowing the user to quickly and easily view an object from many perspectives.
5834868625ff05a97b012913	The Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (TD-TSP), is a generalization of the well-known TSP where the travel times between cities are dependent on the order or time the cities are visited. This work presents an integrated solution procedure for the TD-TSP, thereby unifying Constraint Programming (CP), Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and Decision Diagrams into a single framework. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements over dedicated MIP or CP approaches.
5834868625ff05a97b012a52	This paper addresses the question of how to increase local coherence in summaries of multiparty conversations. Due to the interactive nature of dialogues, local regions of coherence often stretch across di erent speakers, as for instance in question-answer pairs. We present an approach to automatically detect those regions of local coherence and evaluate the resulting summaries' uency and informativeness. Our approach increases summary uency signi cantly while not compromising informativeness.
5834868525ff05a97b00f2dd	Topography and space are two important factors determining plant species assemblages in forest communities. Quantification of the contribution of these two factors in determining species distribution helps us to evaluate their relative importance in determining species assemblages. This study aims to disentangle the effect of topography and space on the distributions of 14 dominant species in a subtropical mixed forest. Spearman correlation analysis and the torus-translation test were used to test the species–habitat associations.

5834868625ff05a97b012a68	We describe a Machine Translation (MT) approach that is specifically designed to enable rapid development of MT for languages with limited amounts of online resources. Our approach assumes the availability of a small number of bi-lingual speakers of the two languages, but these need not be linguistic experts. The bi-lingual speakers create a comparatively small corpus of word aligned phrases and sentences (on the order of magnitude of a few thousand sentence pairs) using a specially designed elicitation tool.
5834868625ff05a97b0124ed	Our tutoring system for fraction addition uses dynamic pictorial representations that reflect student-inputted quantities. However, students had difficulty interpreting the pictorial feedback. Surprisingly, we found that including symbolic numbers with the pictures decreased performance. We hypothesize that students' difficulty may stem from insufficient domain knowledge, or insufficient metacognitive skills to use conceptual knowledge to check their work.
5834868625ff05a97b011103	Kinesin-5, a widely conserved motor protein required for assembly of the bipolar mitotic spindle in eukaryotes, forms homotetramers with two pairs of motor domains positioned at opposite ends of a dumbbell-shaped molecule [1–3]. It has long been assumed that this configuration of motor domains is the basis of kinesin-5's ability to drive relative sliding of microtubules [2, 4, 5]. Recently, it was suggested that in addition to the N-terminal motor domain, kinesin-5 also has a nonmotor microtubule binding site in its C terminus [6].

Several interaction techniques are combined to present a coherent system that makes it easier to make precise designs for laser cutters.
5834868625ff05a97b011737	We compared two privacy configuration styles for specifying rules for social sharing one's past locations. Our findings suggest that location-sharing applications (LSAs) which support varying levels of location granularities are associated with sharing rules that are less convoluted, are less likely to be negatively phrased, and can lead to more open sharing; users are also more comfortable with these rules. These findings can help inform LSA privacy designs.

5834868625ff05a97b011ce6	In this paper we describe the factorization method with linear motions. We design an uni ed representation of scene structure and moving objects by assuming that the objects are moving linearly and with constant speeds. The representation enables the subspace constraints be used to the measurement matrix so that the scene structure, moving trajectories and camera motion are reconstructed simultaneously. We also discuss the solutions for degenerate cases. Preliminary results on synthetic data are also presented.
5834868625ff05a97b01172d	We present a scenegraph-based schema, the ContextMap, to model context information. Locations with hierarchical relations are the skeleton of the ContextMap where nodes of people, objects and activities can be attached. Context information can be collected by traversing the ContextMap. The ContextMap provides a uniform method to represent physical and social semantics for context-aware computing. In addition, context ambiguity can be modeled as well.
5834868625ff05a97b01104f	Well-calibrated probabilities are necessary in many applications like probabilistic frameworks or cost-sensitive tasks. Based on previous success of asymmetric Laplace method in calibrating text classifiers' scores, we propose to use piecewise logistic regression, which is a simple extension of standard logistic regression, as an alternative method in the discriminative family. We show that both methods have the flexibility to be piecewise linear functions in log-odds, but they are based on quite different assumptions.
5834868525ff05a97b00f24b	Electron-paramagnetic-resonance studies of crystals of AgCl doped with Cu 2+ show a rich hyperfine structure. The hyperfine structure is a sum of the hyperfine interaction from the Cu nucleus and the superhyperfine interaction with the four Cl ligand nuclei in the plane perpendicular to the z axis of the crystal. The superhyperfine constants arising from the wave function transferred to the Cu 2+(3 d 9) hole, through the bonding with the Cl ions in the lattice, are found to be A= 20 gauss, and B= 3 gauss.

5834868625ff05a97b0126e5	In this paper we present artificial constraints as a method for guiding heuristic search in the computationally challenging domain of motion planning among movable obstacles. The robot is permitted to manipulate unspecified obstacles in order to create space for a path. A plan is an ordered sequence of paths for robot motion and object manipulation. We show that under monotone assumptions, anticipating future manipulation paths results in constraints on both the choice of objects and their placements at earlier stages in the plan.
5834868625ff05a97b012d5e	Improvements in sequencing technology have made whole-genome sequencing a lot more accessible to researchers in the life sciences. There has been a huge explosion in genomic sequence data over recent years and automated genome-wide function annotation has become a great challenge. The most popular approaches for gene function assignment have been based on sequence similarity. However, homology-based methods are limited in cases where novel sequences show no significant sequence similarity to known genes.

5834868625ff05a97b012c71	Agents often have to perform repeated on-line searches as they gain additional knowledge about their environment. We describe an incremental version of A*, called Adaptive A*, that solves series of similar search problems faster than running A* repeatedly from scratch because it updates its heuristics between search episodes. It is simpler than other incremental versions of A* and thus likely easier to extend and adapt to new applications.
5834868625ff05a97b011338	This demo describes the summarization of textual material about locations in the context of a geo-spatial information display system.

5834868625ff05a97b012cee	A series of neurophysiological experiments on the responses of V1 neurons during saccadic eye movements were carried out. Strong suppression followed by rebound was observed in post-saccadic neural activities. These results showed that although the reduction in perceptual sensitivity during rapid eye movements was largely due to the smearing of visual stimuli during saccades, there exist saccade-related extra-retinal signals mediating saccadic suppression at the neuronal level.

A 2FA with few reversals is an automaton where this number is only o (n). For every h, we exhibit a language that requires Ω (2 h) states on every deterministic 2FA with few reversals, but only h states on a nondeterministic 2FA with few reversals.

We start with a smooth introduction to its basic concepts, which also brings together several seemingly detached, old theorems. We then record recent advances, both in the theory itself and in its relation to Turing machine complexity. Finally, we illustrate a proof technique, which we call hardness propagation by certificates. The entire talk follows, extends, and advocates the Sakoda-Sipser framework.

5834868625ff05a97b01231f	A two-way nondeterministic finite automaton is sweeping (snfa) if its input head can change direction only on the end-markers. For every n, we exhibit a language that can be recognized by an n-state snfa but requires 2^\\varOmega(n) states on every snfa recognizing its complement.
5834868625ff05a97b012321	This is a talk on the size complexity of two-way finite automata. We present the central open problem in the area, explain a motivation behind it, recall its early history, and introduce some of the concepts used in its study. We then sketch a possible future, describe a natural systematic way of pursuing it, and record some of the progress that has been achieved. We add little to what is already known—only exposition, terminology, and questions.

5834868625ff05a97b011606	With the emergence of relatively low-cost real-time 3D imaging sensors, new applications for suites of 3D sensors are becoming practical. For example, 3D sensors in an industrial robotic work cell can monitor workers' positions to ensure their safety. This paper introduces a simple-to-use method for extrinsic calibration of multiple 3D sensors observing a common workspace. Traditional planar target camera calibration techniques are not well-suited for such situations, because multiple cameras may not observe the same target.
5834868625ff05a97b011df1	The authors present a model-based object recognition system for specular objects. Objects with specular surfaces present a problem for computer vision. Simulating object appearances by using the sensor model, and the object model allows us to predict specular features, and to analyze the detectability and reliability of each feature. The system generates a set of aspects of the object. By precompiling the aspects with the feature detectability and the feature reliability, the system prepares adaptable matching templates.
5834868625ff05a97b012cf1	This paper explores the statistical relationship between natural images and their underlying range (depth) images. We look at how this relationship changes over scale, and how this information can be used to enhance low resolution range data using a full resolution intensity image. Based on our findings, we propose an extension to an existing technique known as shape recipes [1], and the success of the two methods are compared using images and laser scans of real scenes.
5834868725ff05a97b013ca5	The JAVELIN system integrates a flexible, planning-based architecture with a variety of language processing modules to provide an open-domain question answering capability on free text. The demonstration will focus on how JAVELIN processes questions and retrieves the most likely answer candidates from the given text corpus. The operation of the system will be explained in depth through browsing the repository of data objects created by the system during each question answering session.
5834868625ff05a97b0128e6	NavCog is a novel smartphone navigation system for people with visual impairments or blindness, capable of assisting the users during autonomous mobility in complex and unfamiliar indoor/outdoor environments. The accurate localization achieved by NavCog is used for precise turn-by-turn way-finding assistance as the first step, but the ultimate goal is to present a variety of location based information to the user, such as points of interest gathered from social media and online geografic information services.
5834868625ff05a97b0113b7	BLANC is a link-based coreference evaluation metric for measuring the quality of coreference systems on gold mentions. This paper extends the original BLANC (“BLANC-gold” henceforth) to system mentions, removing the gold mention assumption. The proposed BLANC falls back seamlessly to the original one if system mentions are identical to gold mentions, and it is shown to strongly correlate with existing metrics on the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL data.
5834868625ff05a97b013017	The use of computer-based tools to teach argumentation s&ills has recently become quite popular. To understand the breadth of activity in this area, bridging between published results and real-world development, we conducted a survey in which 97 argumentation experts participated. Based on data from the survey, this paper summarizes the rationale and motivation behind design decisions, important lessons learned, and future research directions.
5834868625ff05a97b011104	Microassembly systems are a class of representative optomechatronic systems that play a critical role in the fabrication, packaging, and interconnection of hybrid microsystems such as hybrid microelectromechanical systems. Optomechatronic integration is essential to the development of microassembly systems due to the basic importance of microscope optics to microassembly. In this paper, the role of microscope optics in microassembly systems is analyzed. The general architecture of microassembly systems is introduced.
5834868625ff05a97b011ffa	We show how the curvature measures used to study nonlinearity in nonlinear regression may be generalized to other models. We first briefly review some roles for curvature both in nonlinear regression (Bates and Wattsfl]) and in general asymptotic inference based on a-connections (Amari [2j). We then indicate the relationship between these two separate areas of research and from this define data-analytical curvature measures for exponential family nonlinear models.
5834868625ff05a97b011e23	The article presents a list of publications received by the journal including “A Woman's Place: Management,” by Connie Sitterly and Beth Duke,“Working it Out: Sanity & Stress in the Workplace,” by Stephen Strasser, and “Unlocking: A Guide to Creative Living,” by Daniel Sandowsky.
5834868625ff05a97b013057	This video shows the investigation of a novel minimalistic, dynamic climbing robot which can climb up tubes of different shapes using a simple dc motor. The motor moves an eccentric mass in a constant velocity. The location of the eccentric mass relative to the contact point determines the stability and the direction of the climbing motion. We present the analysis of this mechanism, simulation and experimental results.
5834868625ff05a97b0123a5	This paper studies active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes.
5834868625ff05a97b012623	Designing a human interface to a computer system is more art than science. Systematic research on the human interface to computer systems, when it is performed, is generally an after-the-fact evaluation of an almost finished product. This sort of evaluation is often too specific to a particular product to provide general prescriptions for future interface design and often occurs too late to have a substantial impact on product development. Rarely do research and evaluation provide guidance throughout the development cycle.
5834868525ff05a97b00e92b	This paper introduces the transformation scheme of Weinan TV media virtual studio, virtual graphic and pointed out the background of large screen broadcast is a primary element of transformation, mainly from the aspects of design of the four systems described. And part of the key production equipment is described.
5834868425ff05a97b00e760	Although household devices and home appliances function more and more as network-connected computers, they don't provide programming interfaces for the average user. We first identify the programming primitives and control structures necessary for the universal programming of devices. We then propose a mapping between the features necessary for the programming of devices and the existing functionality of Scratch, an educational programming language we use as a basic interface between the devices and the users.

5834868525ff05a97b010384	The miscibility of Polypropylene (PP)/Polyamide-11 (PA11) blends (with the weight ratio at 10/90, 30/70, 50/50, 70/30 and 90/10) are investigated by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) and mesoscopic dynamic (MesoDyn) simulations. The Flory—Huggins parameters χ and the radial distribution functions of the inter-molecular atoms suggest that PP/PA11 90/10 blend was more miscible. The order parameter computed for different blends can also predict the blend miscibility, and at PP/PA11 90/10 blend, partial miscibility was observed.
5834868625ff05a97b0126e9	Advances in computing hardware, software, and network technology have enabled a new class of interactive applications involving 3D animated characters to become increasingly feasible. Many such applications require algorithms that allow both autonomous and user-controlled animated human figures to move naturally and realistically in response to task-level commands. This thesis presents a research framework aimed at facilitating the high-level control of animated characters in real-time virtual environments.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7bd	Abstract—Having many degrees of freedom is both a blessing and a curse. A mechanism with a large number of degrees of freedom can better comply to and therefore better move in complex environments. Yet, possessing many degrees of freedom is only an advantage if the system is capable of coordinating them to achieve desired goals in realtime. This work supports the belief that a middle layer of abstraction between conventional planning and control is needed to enable robust locomotion of articulated systems in complex terrains.
5834868625ff05a97b01265c	Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves collaborative learning environments that adapt their characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective.
5834868625ff05a97b011a0c	We have studied the InfoMax (D-optimality) learning for the two-link Furuta pendulum. We compared InfoMax and random learning methods. The InfoMax learning method won by a large margin, it visited a larger domain and provided better approximation during the same time interval. The advantages and the limitations of the InfoMax solution are treated.
5834868625ff05a97b012a07	We study the problem of allocating a set of indivisible items to agents with additive utilities to maximize the Nash social welfare.

5834868625ff05a97b01295d	The k-means problem consists of finding k centers in R d R d that minimize the sum of the squared distances of all points in an input set P from R d R d to their closest respective center. Awasthi et al. recently showed that there exists a constant ε′> 0 ε′> 0 such that it is NP-hard to approximate the k-means objective within a factor of 1+ ε′ 1+ ε′. We establish that 1+ ε′ 1+ ε′ is at least 1.0013.
5834868625ff05a97b012d6c	We describe CMU LTI's participation in the KBP 2015 Event Track. We officially participated in Task 1: Event Nugget Detection track and Task 3: Event Coreference track. Our system rank high in both tracks. We found that our combined system is competitive but have room to improve. In addition, we have conducted follow up experiments by creating a simple piplined system, and We found it competitive comparing to the official submissions.
5834868625ff05a97b0113d3	Event coreference is an important task for full text analysis. However, previous work uses a variety of approaches, sources and evaluation, making the literature confusing and the results incommensurate. We provide a description of the differences to facilitate future research. Second, we present a supervised method for event coreference resolution that uses a rich feature set and propagates information alternatively between events and their arguments, adapting appropriately for each type of argument.
5834868625ff05a97b012d8d	Elastic rod theory and principles of contact mechanics motivate the development of a novel, shear-activated, microfiber array adhesive. Unlike with conventional Pressure Sensitive Adhesives (PSAs), the microfiber array and backing are composed entirely of a stiff, glassy polymer (polypropylene, elastic modulus E= 1 GPa) and an externally applied shear load is required to achieve contact with a substrate. Previously, results from a Shear Power Test on glass indicated a maximum interfacial shear strength of 10 kPa over 4 sq.
5834868725ff05a97b013d73	Summary Proteomics, the comprehensive and systematic study of the properties of all expressed proteins, has become a major research area in computational biology and bioinformatics. Among these properties, knowledge of the specific subcellular structures in which a protein is located is perhaps the most critical to a complete understanding of the protein's roles and functions. Subcellular location is most commonly determined via fluorescence microscopy, an optical method relying on target-specific fluorescent probes.

The method and system include exposed patterns on facing surfaces of sliding structures. The facing patterns contain MR fluid. When a low to moderate magnetic field is applied to the MR fluid, the patterns are magnetically attracted to MR domains confined to the opposing surface, thus requiring additional force to slide the structures past each other.
5834868625ff05a97b0114d9	In order to answer factoid questions, the Webclopedia QA system employs a range of knowledge resources.

In this work, we build and evaluate the efficacy of descriptive models of subjective scores that native signers assign to ASL animations, based on eye-tracking metrics.
5834868525ff05a97b00f1a8	The base glass for a self-focusing lens was prepared. The test on its optical transmittance was conducted, and analysis of the refractive index profile of a gradient index (GRIN) rod made of the base glass was performed. The results show the current base glass possesses transmittance higher than 89% in visible and near infrared bands, and the refractive index profile in the GRIN rod is in close proximity to the ideal distribution.
5834868625ff05a97b01197a	Braille code, employing six embossed dots evenly arranged in rectangular letter spaces or cells, constitutes the dominant touch reading or typing system for the blind. Limited to 63 possible dot combinations per cell, there are a number of application examples, such as mathematics and sciences, and assistive technologies, such as braille displays, in which the 6-dot cell braille is extended to 8-dot. This work proposes a language-independent methodology for the systematic development of an 8-dot braille code.
5834868625ff05a97b01157d	There is an increasing interest in haptic (sense of touch) interaction with computers. A new kind of haptic system has recently been developed at Carnegie Mellon University and commercialized by Butterfly Haptics. The system eliminates the bulky links, cables and general mechanical complexity of other haptic devices on the market today in favor of a single lightweight moving part that floats on magnetic fields. At the heart of the maglev haptic interface is a bowl-shaped assembly called a flotor that has six embedded coils of wire.

5834868425ff05a97b00e78a	In this article, we use an automated bottom-up approach to identify semantic categories in an entire corpus. We conduct an experiment using a word vector model to represent the meaning of words. The word vectors are then clustered, giving a bottom-up representation of semantic categories. Our main finding is that the likelihood of changes in a word's meaning correlates with its position within its cluster.
5834868625ff05a97b0119b8	This paper presents a new and simple automatic rigging method for articulated movement of 3D human models. Realistic motion tracking and animation of human models requires adaptive estimations of the joint structure having anthropometric features. For this purpose, we propose a model-based approach representing kinematic joint structure and using cut-plane joint extraction on 3D reconstructed volume models of the individual person.

5834868725ff05a97b013e66	We present an approach to pronominal anaphora resolution using KANT Controlled Language and the KANTOO multilingual MT system. Our algorithm is based on a robust, syntax-based approach that applies a set of restrictions and preferences to select the correct antecedent. We report a success rate of 93.3% on a training corpus with 286 anaphors, and 88.8% on held-out data with 144 anaphors. Our approach translates anaphors to Spanish with 97.9% accuracy and to German with 94.4% accuracy on held-out data.
5834868725ff05a97b013e69	Question answering (QA) aims at finding exact answers to a user's question from a large collection of documents. Most QA systems combine information retrieval with extraction techniques to identify a set of likely candidates and then utilize some ranking strategy to generate the final answers. This ranking process can be challenging, as it entails identifying the relevant answers amongst many irrelevant ones. This is more challenging in multi-strategy QA, in which multiple answering agents are used to extract answer candidates.

5834868625ff05a97b012d4f	The majority of smart home research has focused on novel technical artifacts, but has overlooked the issues surrounding social relationships in the home. We argue in favor of research that is sensitive to and functions within the social constraints of dual income family homes. This paper describes our grounded contextual fieldwork with real families in their homes, and identifies socially-aware concepts smart home systems will need to address.
5834868625ff05a97b012d52	A handover is a complex collaboration, where actors coordinate in time and space to transfer control of an object. This coordination comprises two processes: the physical process of moving to get close enough to transfer the object, and the cognitive process of exchanging information to guide the transfer. Despite this complexity, we humans are capable of performing handovers seamlessly in a wide variety of situations, even when unexpected. This suggests a common procedure that guides all handover interactions.
5834868625ff05a97b012662	We discuss how to apply statistical tests to compare different ACT-R models, by treating the ACT-R models as approximations of the mathematical models underlying them. To this end, we propose a method for deciding how many times to run a model, and a method for determining how many free parameters each model has.
5834868425ff05a97b00e4ef	Effective communication is perhaps the most visible and important ability for intelligent agents to operate in a physical world, to form relationships with and learn from other agents and to form societies that magnify and empower the abilities of the individual.

NavEx implements a specific kind of adaptive navigation support known as adaptive annotation. The classroom study of NavEx confirmed that adaptive navigation support can visibly increase student motivation to work with non-mandatory educational content. NavEx boosted the overall amount of work and the average length of a session. In addition, various features of NavEx were highly regarded by the students.
5834868625ff05a97b013023	Consumer electronic devices are made by the millions, and automating their production is a key manufacturing challenge. Fastening machine screws is among the most difficult components of this challenge. To accomplish this task with sufficient robustness for industry, detecting and recovering from failure is essential. We have built a robotic screwdriving system to collect data on this process. Using it, we collected data on 1862 screwdriving runs, each consisting of force, torque, motor current and speed, and video.
5834868625ff05a97b01302f	Parts orienting, the process of bringing parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is an important aspect of automated assembly. The most common industrial orienting systems are vibratory bowl feeders, which use the shape and mass properties of parts to orient them. Bowl feeders rely on a sequence of mechanical operations and typically do not use sensors. In this paper, we describe the use of partial information sensors along with a sequence of pushing operations to eliminate uncertainty in the orientations of parts.
5834868625ff05a97b013140	In this paper, we discuss design considerations and our plans to develop a generalized framework for intelligent support in educational argumentation systems. Our goal is to develop a framework that will support the development of argumentation learning systems across a variety of domains (eg, the law, ethics).
5834868525ff05a97b00f18e	Deals with the occrrence dynamics of Phyllocoptruta oleivora Ashmead (POA) and its relationship to environmental factors and its natural enemy (NE). Okiseius subtropicus Ehara and Aglistemus exsertus Gonzalez-Rodoriguez were the dominant NE of POA. They had obvious control effect on the growth and decline of the population of POA. In this ecological citrus orchards, preying mites should be the main NE crowd.
5834868425ff05a97b00e765	Although many users create predictable passwords, the extent to which users realize these passwords are predictable is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between users' perceptions of the strength of specific passwords and their actual strength. In this 165-participant online study, we ask participants to rate the comparative security of carefully juxtaposed pairs of passwords, as well as the security and memorability of both existing passwords and common password-creation strategies.
5834868625ff05a97b01170d	In order to produce a good summary, one has to identify the most relevant portions of a given text. We describe in this paper a method for automatically training topic signatures-sets of related words, with associated weights, organized around head topics and illustrate with signatures we created with 6,194 TREC collection texts over 4 selected topics. We describe the possible integration of topic signatures with outologies and its evaluaton on an automated text summarization system.
5834868625ff05a97b011eb3	The Precision Freehand Sculptor (PFS) is a compact, handheld, intelligent tool to assist the surgeon in accurately cutting bone. A retractable rotary blade on the PFS allows a computer to control what bone is removed. Accuracy is ensured even though the surgeon uses the tool freehand. The computer extends or retracts the blade based on data from an optical tracking camera. Three users used each of three PFS prototype concepts to cut a faceted shape in wax. The results of this experiment were analyzed to identify the largest sources of error.
5834868725ff05a97b0146ea	A method, an apparatus and an article of manufacture for processing a random-walk based vertex-proximity query on a graph. The method includes computing at least one vertex cluster and corresponding meta-information from a graph, dynamically updating the clustering and corresponding meta-information upon modification of the graph, and identifying a vertex cluster relevant to at least one query vertex and aggregating corresponding meta-information of the cluster to process the query.
5834868525ff05a97b00eb1c	Because of its high efficiency in restraining tumor, being easy in parameter controlling and no remnants toxicity, the use of electrical technologies in cancer therapy has gotten quite great progress in only more than 20 years. The effects of different electrical stimulate methods to the malignancy tissue from different angles are introduced. These electrical stimulate methods change the living environment of malignancy tissue to help or direct treat cancer.
5834868625ff05a97b01170f	We describe the OntoNotes methodology and its result, a large multilingual richly-annotated corpus constructed at 90% interannotator agreement. An initial portion (300K words of English newswire and 250K words of Chinese newswire) will be made available to the community during 2007.
5834868725ff05a97b0141b5	The paper “On the Difficulty of Software-Based Attestation of Embedded Devices” had been published at the ACM CCS 2009 conference [1]. Although the paper contains many useful points, unfortunately, it also contains numerous errors and inaccuracies which we would like to rectify with this note.
5834868725ff05a97b0141d5	Multi-path routing is effective to enhance network availability, by selecting multiple failure-independent paths for reaching one destination in the hope to survive individual path failures. Researchers suggest to select IP-layer topologically disjoint paths, assuming that they are failure-independent and can hardly fail simultaneously. Unfortunately, failure correlations lurking behind the IP-layer topology can surreptitiously squash availability gained through multi-path routing because selected paths can fail simultaneously.
5834868725ff05a97b014235	Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (eg, to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (eg, to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data).
5834868625ff05a97b01321c	Examines a little-studied method of manipulation-manipulation by striking an object and letting it slide. There are two parts to this problem: The inverse sliding problem, determining the velocities required to send an object to a desired configuration, and the impact problem, determining how to strike the object in order to achieve those velocities. The authors present a solution to these two problems for the class of rotationally symmetric objects and conclude with some observations about this method of manipulation.
5834868725ff05a97b014241	We discuss three key challenges for securing cyberphysical systems:(1) understanding the threats, and possible consequences of attacks,(2) identifying the unique properties of cyber-physical systems and their differences from traditional IT security, and (3) discussing security mechanisms applicable to cyberphysical systems. In particular, we analyze security mechanisms for: prevention, detection and recovery, resilience and deterrence of attacks.

5834868625ff05a97b01324e	Halin showed that every edge minimal, k-vertex connected graph has a vertex of degree k. In this note, we prove the analogue to Halin's theorem for edge-minimal, k-edge-connected graphs. We show there are two vertices of degree k in every edge-minimal, k-edge-connected graph.
5834868625ff05a97b01329d	New input technologies (such as touch), recognition based input (such as pen gestures) and next-generation interactions (such as inexact interaction) all hold the promise of more natural user interfaces. However, these techniques all create inputs with some uncertainty. Unfortunately, conventional infrastructure lacks a method for easily handling uncertainty, and as a result input produced by these technologies is often converted to conventional events as quickly as possible, leading to a stunted interactive experience.

5834868625ff05a97b011377	Question Answering (QA) evaluation potentially provides a way to evaluate systems that attempt to understand texts automatically. Although current QA technologies are still unable to answer complex questions that require deep inference, we believe QA evaluation techniques must be adapted to drive QA research in the direction of deeper understanding of texts. In this paper we propose such evolution by suggesting an evaluation methodology focused on the understanding of individual documents at a deeper level.
5834868625ff05a97b011378	This paper overviews BUPTTeam's participation in the main task organized within the RTE7 Evaluation.

Our system designed to recognize textual entailment typically employ lexical information. The evaluation results show that our method is effective for RTE task.
5834868625ff05a97b0124a6	Adding student collaboration to an intelligent tutoring system could leverage the benefits of both approaches. We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.
5834868625ff05a97b012154	This paper characterizes managerial problem sensing, a necessary precondition for managerial activity directed toward organizational adaptation, as composed of noticing, interpreting, and incorporating stimuli. It then reviews the constituent social cognition processes that make certain kinds of problem-sensing behavior, including errors, relatively likely to occur. Implications for the organizational issues of crisis, chance events, break points, and extreme change are explored.
5834868625ff05a97b01253c	Pickering & Garrod's (P&G's) theory of dialogue production cannot completely explain recent data showing that when interactants in referential communication tasks have different views of a physical space, they accommodate their language to their partner's view rather than mimicking their partner's expressions. Instead, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that interactants are taking the perspective of their conversational partners.
5834868625ff05a97b01216c	Correlation filters take advantage of specific properties in the Fourier domain allowing them to be estimated efficiently: O (ND log D) in the frequency domain, versus O (D^ 3+ ND^ 2) spatially where D is signal length, and N is the number of signals. Recent extensions to correlation filters, such as MOSSE, have reignited interest of their use in the vision community due to their robustness and attractive computational properties. In this paper we demonstrate, however, that this computational efficiency comes at a cost.
5834868625ff05a97b012598	Building an intelligent agent that simulates human learning of math and science could potentially benefit both cognitive science, by contributing to the understanding of human learning, and artificial intelligence, by advancing the goal of creating human-level intelligence. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone.

5834868625ff05a97b013408	How can we correlate the neural activity in the human brain as it responds to typed words, with properties of these terms (like 'edible','fits in hand')? In short, we want to find latent variables, that jointly explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. This is one of many settings of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem.
5834868525ff05a97b00f658	Bacterial infection of subcutaneous “pockets” housing cardiovascular implantable electronic devices is a significant clinical complication. In this study, pacemakers encapsulated in a blood plasma-based material (PBM) composited with antibiotics were investigated for use as prophylactics against such infections. PBMs, which are made from pooled allogeneic plasma and platelets, are off-the-shelf biomaterials that can be manufactured in the form of complex 3D shapes, extrudable putties, or injectable pastes.

5834868425ff05a97b00e5b3	Jibbigo is a speech-to-speech translation application for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad devices. Jibbigo allows the user to simply speak a sentence, and it speaks the sentence aloud in the other language, much like a personal human interpreter would. The speech-to-speech translation is bi-directional for a two way dialog between participants.
5834868425ff05a97b00e7c7	We present a novel mechanical system, the “landfish,” which takes advantage of a combination of articulation and a nonholonomic constraint to exhibit fishlike locomotion. We apply geometric mechanics techniques to establish the equations of motion in terms of the system's nonholonomic momentum and analyze the system's equilibrium properties. Finally, we demonstrate its locomotion capabilities under several controllers, including heading and joint velocity control.
5834868625ff05a97b0122b1	Geometrical foundations of asymptotic inference are described in simple cases, without the machinery of differential geometry. A primary statistical goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the ideas of Fisher and Jeffreys. The role of differential geometry in generalizing results is indicated, further applications are mentioned, and geometrical methods in nonlinear regression are related to those developed for general parametric families.
5834868725ff05a97b014414	We report the results of our work on automating the transliteration decision of named entities for English to Arabic machine translation. We construct a classification-based framework to automate this decision, evaluate our classifier both in the limited news and the diverse Wikipedia domains, and achieve promising accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate a reduction of translation error and an improvement in the performance of an English-to-Arabic machine translation system.
5834868725ff05a97b014425	We present our correction annotation guidelines to create a manually corrected nonnative (L2) Arabic corpus. We develop our approach by extending an L1 large-scale Arabic corpus and its manual corrections, to include manually corrected non-native Arabic learner essays. Our overarching goal is to use the annotated corpus to develop components for automatic detection and correction of language errors that can be used to help Standard Arabic learners (native and non-native) improve the quality of the Arabic text they produce.
5834868725ff05a97b01442d	We present an approach to MT between Turkic languages and present results from an implementation of a MT system from Turkmen to Turkish.

5834868625ff05a97b0113b5	The automatic interpretation of semantic relations between nominals is an important subproblem within natural language understanding applications and is an area of increasing interest. In this paper, we present the system we used to participate in the SemEval 2010 Task 8 Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nominals. Our system, based upon a Maximum Entropy classifier trained using a large number of boolean features, received the third highest score.
5834868625ff05a97b0120cc	In this paper we present a unified factorization algorithm for recovering structure and motion from image sequences by using point features, line segments and planes. This new formulation is based on directional uncertainty model for features. Points and line segments are both described by the same probabilistic models and so can be recovered in the same way. Prior information on the coplanarity of features is shown to fit naturally into the new factorization formulation and provides additional constraints for the shape recovery.
5834868525ff05a97b00f66c	This paper discusses a method for finding near-optimal build orientations for shape deposition manufacturing (SDM). SDM is a solid freeform fabrication process that allows the creation of complex shaped parts by the iterative application of numerically controlled material deposition and milling operations. The part build time in SDM process depends on the number of layers. And the number of layers depends on the build orientation. Therefore, finding build orientation is a crucial step in the process planning of SDM parts.

5834868725ff05a97b0144e6	Prior studies have shown that learning by problem solving in an intelligent tutoring system such as the Cognitive Tutor can be even more effective when worked examples are added in comparison to problem solving alone. Introducing selfexplanation prompts additionally improves learning. Furthermore, recent findings indicate that fading out worked examples according to students' performance during learning (ie, adaptive fading) is even more beneficial than fading worked examples in a predefined procedure (ie, fixed fading).

Four versions of the game are detailed, along with preliminary player data in a 2× 2 pilot test with 64 children shaping the modifications of Beanstalk for much broader testing.
5834868625ff05a97b012258	Feature-oriented software development (FOSD) is a paradigm for the construction, customization, and synthesis of large-scale software systems. In this survey, we give an overview and a personal perspective on the roots of FOSD, connections to other software development paradigms, and recent developments in this field. Our aim is to point to connections between different lines of research and to identify open issues.
5834868625ff05a97b012626	Technology-mediated social-participation systems, such as Wikipedia and TopCoder, allow a vast user base to collaborate to solve difficult problems. TMSP could be applied to many current social issues, but doing so requires new theory and infrastructure for social design.
5834868625ff05a97b012636	We report an empirical study of aircraft maintenance workers using wearable visual interfaces and collaborative systems to support troubleshooting and repair work.

Study results are being used to inform design and rapid prototyping of wearable systems for use in vehicle maintenance systems.
5834868725ff05a97b013888	Abstract—The tracking of objects and humans has recently received a lot of attention as a tool to improve business processes, occupational and public safety. In industrial environments wireless sensor networks can facilitate deployment of tracking applications as they can establish a standalone communication infrastructure (a so called mesh network). Many such positioning and location tracking systems deploy a fixed infrastructure (so-called beacons) with known positions to determine the position of mobile nodes in the network.
5834868625ff05a97b0110a8	Distributed applications are difficult to program reliably and securely. Dependently typed functional languages promise to prevent broad classes of errors and vulnerabilities, and to enable program verification to proceed side-by-side with development. However, as recursion, effects, and rich libraries are added, using types to reason about programs, specifications, and proofs becomes challenging. We present F*, a full-fledged design and implementation of a new dependently typed language for secure distributed programming.

Some pairs of vertices are connected by edges. We can represent the edges as a set {E} of unordered pairs:{(j, k)\\in E} if and only if there is an edge between {X_j} and {X_k}.
5834868525ff05a97b00f278	We discuss nonparametric density estimation and regression for astrophysics problems. In particular, we show how to compute nonparametric confidence intervals for the location and size of peaks of a function. We illustrate these ideas with recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also briefly discuss nonparametric Bayesian inference.
5834868625ff05a97b011a2f	This paper describes SimpLex, a Lexical Simplification system that participated in the English Lexical Simplification shared task at SemEval-2012.

The system outperforms a very strong baseline, and ranked first on the shared task.
5834868625ff05a97b01264c	networks allow businesses to share computerized data with customers, suppliers, and other outside entities. Businesses investing in such data networks gain competitive advantage. A national data network provides virtually universal access, interconnecting most businesses and private citizens in a country. But establishing a national data network is very costly and must be justified through its economic, service, and social impact. In 1991, France—with its Teletel system—was close to having a national data network, whereas the US was not.
5834868525ff05a97b010e82	This paper describes the two Story Link Detection systems Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed, and examines why their performance on the evaluation data was considerably worse than expected while performance on an alternate evaluation set matched the performance on the training data.
5834868625ff05a97b011415	PhishGuru is an embedded training system that teaches users to avoid falling for phishing attacks by delivering a training message when the user clicks on the URL in a simulated phishing email. In previous lab and real-world experiments, we validated the effectiveness of this approach. Here, we extend our previous work with a 515-participant, real-world study in which we focus on long-term retention and the effect of two training messages. We also investigate demographic factors that influence training and general phishing susceptibility.
5834868625ff05a97b012691	This paper illustrates a technique for determining whether the knowledge acquired by students over the course of an instructional intervention can be used flexibly across problem contexts.

We present our control strategy as anchoring [1] to appropriately selected “compartments” 2 of the full dynamics a suite of 1-DOF templates which we couple together in the style of [3]. We present initial empirical evidence and conjecture (without proof) that the limit behavior of the coupled system is conjugate to a cross product of the constituent templates' limit behaviors.
5834868625ff05a97b011883	ABSTRACT: There is a need for cognitively bounded implementations of transactive memory \nfor agents. To do this, we use schema theory and tiered social cognition to implement Mead's \nGeneralized Other (1925). We then compared our new implementation, Construct-ML, with a \nprior implementation of the same simulation, Construct- O. We were not able to replicate all of \nthe patterns suggested by Construct-O's results. However, the pattern validity of Construct-ML \nimproves as agents have more cognitive resources, which is suggestive and interesting.
5834868625ff05a97b0118e5	Because of its power and flexibility, the UNIX operating system has become an almost standard tool for computer science. research.

5834868625ff05a97b011929	Visual odometry can be augmented by depth information such as provided by RGB-D cameras, or from lidars associated with cameras. However, such depth information can be limited by the sensors, leaving large areas in the visual images where depth is unavailable. Here, we propose a method to utilize the depth, even if sparsely available, in recovery of camera motion. In addition, the method utilizes depth by structure from motion using the previously estimated motion, and salient visual features for which depth is unavailable.
5834868725ff05a97b0145f0	This paper describes an intelligent tutoring system, LARGO, that helps students learn skills of legal reasoning with hypotheticals by analyzing oral arguments before the US Supreme Court. The skills involve proposing a rule-like test for deciding a case, posing hypotheticals to challenge the rule, and responding by analogizing or distinguishing the hypotheticals and/or modifying the proposed test. Students diagram arguments in a special-purpose graphical language and receive feedback in the form of reflection questions.
5834868525ff05a97b00f678	In this paper we describe an application of a lightly supervised Role Identification Model (RIM) to the analysis of coordination in Wikipedia talk page discussions. Our goal is to understand the substance of important coordination roles that predict quality of the Wikipedia pages where the discussions take place. Using the model as a lens, we present an analysis of four important coordination roles identified using the model, including Workers, Critiquers, Encouragers, and Managers.
5834868525ff05a97b00f679	Through the lens of Expectancy Value Theory, we examine the effect of help giver badges, information about helper expertise, and up-and downvoting on help seeking in a MOOC discussion forum. Results show that badges alleviated the negative impact on help seeking introduced by up-and downvoting.
5834868625ff05a97b012a25	We present an evolutionary approach using Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically create software repairs. By concentrating the modifications on regions related to where the bug occurs, we effectively minimize the search space complexity and hence increase the performance of the GP process. To preserve the core functionalities of the program, we evolve programs only from code in the original program. Early experimental results show our GP approach is able to fix various program defects in reasonable time.
5834868625ff05a97b0123ad	A method of virtualizing reality, ie, a method of creating virtual reality from images of a real event, is comprised of the steps of capturing a plurality of images of each time instant of a real event using a plurality of cameras positioned at a plurality of angles. Each image is stored as intensity and/or color information. A suitable internal representation is computed from these images and the information regarding the camera angles. An image of each time instant may be generated from any viewing angle using the internal representation of it.

5834868725ff05a97b013915	This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.
5834868525ff05a97b010f4f	The requirement to operate aircraft in GPS-denied environments can be met by using visual odometry. Aiming at a full-scale aircraft equipped with a high-accuracy inertial navigation system (INS), the proposed method combines vision and the INS for odometry estimation. With such an INS, the aircraft orientation is accurate with low drift, but it contains high-frequency noise that can affect the vehicle motion estimation, causing position estimation to drift. Our method takes the INS orientation as input and estimates translation.

The method includes: reporting, by a UE, a CQI value to an eNB; receiving, by the UE, an MCS value sent by the eNB, where the MCS value is determined by the eNB according to the CQI value; and receiving, by the UE, PDSCH data according to the MCS value, where the CQI value and the MCS value are determined according to a second set of tables, where a modulation scheme that can be supported by the second set of tables is higher than 64QAM.
5834868625ff05a97b0117b1	Since the introduction of programmable industrial robots at the beginning of the 1970s, an industry based on these machines grew steadily to a point in the mid-1980s where it was poised for an explosion of huge proportions. This explosion failed to happen as a “robotics backlash” took hold, with the strong perception held by many that these machines did not, and would not, live up to the high expectations held by their users.
5834868725ff05a97b01376d	The Information Technology Center (ITC), a collaborative effort between IBM and Carnegie-Mellon University, is in the process of creating Andrew, a prototype computing and communication system for universities. This article traces the origins of Andrew, discusses its goals and strategies, and gives an overview of the current status of its implementation and usage.
5834868625ff05a97b011203	This paper describes a new spoken dialog portal that connects systems produced by the spoken dialog research community and gives them access to real users. We introduce a prototype dialog framework that affords easy integration with various remote dialog agents as well as external knowledge resources. To date, the DialPort portal has successfully connected to two dialog systems and several public knowledge APIs. We present current progress and envision our future plan.
5834868625ff05a97b0133c0	By combining memory-based learning methods with likelihood analysis, we provide a technique which can distinguish the underlying system given a set of the system input and output observations. It is surprising that this straightforward technique is capable of doing many hard jobs. As a demonstration, we use it to distinguish different styles of manipulating a tennis simulator. Also, we apply it to a driving style detection domain, using both simulation and real world data.
5834868525ff05a97b00f512	Infinite SVM (iSVM) is a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture of large-margin classifiers. Though flexible in learning nonlinear classifiers and discovering latent clustering structures, iSVM has a difficult inference task and existing methods could hinder its applicability to large-scale problems. This paper presents a smallvariance asymptotic analysis to derive a simple and efficient algorithm, which monotonically optimizes a maxmargin DP-means (M2DPM) problem, an extension of DP-means for both predictive learning and descriptive clustering.
5834868525ff05a97b00f736	Valley pseudospin, the quantum degree of freedom characterizing the degenerate valleys in energy bands, is a distinct feature of two-dimensional Dirac materials. Similar to spin, the valley pseudospin is spanned by a time reversal pair of states, though the two valley pseudospin states transform to each other under spatial inversion. The breaking of inversion symmetry induces various valley-contrasted physical properties; for instance, valley-dependent topological transport is of both scientific and technological interests.
5834868725ff05a97b014612	We present the results of a study in which we contrast alternative forms of collaborative learning support in the midst of a collaborative design task in which students negotiate between increasing power and increasing environmental friendliness. In this context, we evaluated the instructional effectiveness of four alternative support conditions as well as a goal manipulation. Both manipulations yield surprising findings, which we are continuing to investigate.
5834868625ff05a97b0111c7	The majority of smart home research has focused on novel technical artifacts, but has overlooked the issues surrounding social relationships in the home. We argue in favor of research that is sensitive to and functions within the social constraints of dual income family homes. This paper describes our grounded contextual fieldwork with real families in their homes, and identifies socially-aware concepts smart home systems will need to address.
5834868725ff05a97b01469d	Object-oriented programs are notable for making use of both higher-order abstractions and mutable, aliased state. Either feature alone is challenging for formal verification, and the combination yields very flexible program designs and correspondingly difficult verification problems. In this paper, we show how to formally specify and verify programs that use several common design patterns in concert.
5834868625ff05a97b01275f	We outline some of the benefits of shared visual information for collaborative repair tasks and report on a study comparing collaborative performance on a manual task by workers and helpers who are located side-by-side or connected via audio-video or audio-only links. Results show that the dyads complete the task more quickly and accurately when helpers are co-located than when they are connected via an audio link. However, they didn't achieve similar efficiency gains when they communicated through an audio/video link.
5834868625ff05a97b011a99	Modern computer displays tend to be in fixed size, rigid, and rectilinear rendering them insensitive to the visual area demands of an application or the desires of the user. Foldable displays offer the ability to reshape and resize the interactive surface at our convenience and even permit us to carry a very large display surface in a small volume. In this paper, we implement four interactive foldable display designs using image projection with low-cost tracking and explore display behaviors using orientation sensitivity.

5834868725ff05a97b0147c6	Many algorithms exist for producing quality meshes when the input point cloud is known a priori. However, modern finite element simulations and graphics applications need to change the input set during the simulation dynamically. We show how to dynamically update the mesh under changes in the input as points are added or removed one by one while maintaining quality guarantees with an optimal number of additional vertices. Our algorithm runs in optimal O (lg L/s) time per update, where L/s is the spread of the input.
5834868625ff05a97b012df6	A fabricated microstructure includes a substrate, a primary fiber, and a plurality of base fibers. The primary fiber has a width less than about 5 microns. Each base fiber of the plurality of base fibers has a first end attached to the primary fiber and a second end attached to the substrate. Each base fiber has a width less than the width of the primary fiber.
5834868625ff05a97b011228	With the widespread availability of low-cost devices capable of photo shooting and high-volume video recording, we are facing explosion of both image and video data. The sheer volume of such visual data poses both challenges and opportunities in machine learning and computer vision research. In image classification, most of previous research has focused on small to medium-scale data sets, containing objects from dozens of categories. However, we could easily access images spreading thousands of categories.
5834868625ff05a97b01122f	Compressed sensing has received much attention in both data mining and signal processing communities. In this paper, we provide theoretical results to show that compressed spectral clustering, separating data samples into different clusters directly in the compressed measurement domain, is possible. Specifically, we provide theoretical bounds guaranteeing that if the data is measured directly in the compressed domain, spectral clustering on the compressed data works almost as well as that in the data domain.
5834868625ff05a97b01129d	This paper describes a multi-site project to annotate the interlingual content of six sizable bilingual parallel corpora. The project addresses several principal problems in parallel: specification of interlingua content and notation, development of reliable annotation methods, and evaluation of annotated corpora. As a by-product, a growing corpus of annotated texts is being produced, which may eventually be useful for machine learning of semantics-based processing.
5834868625ff05a97b01201a	The notion of hypothesis is fundamental to science. Typically it refers to an idea that might plausibly be true, and that is to be examined or “tested” with some experimental data. Sometimes, the expectation is that the data will conform to the hypothesis. In other situations, the hypothesis is introduced with the goal of refuting it.
5834868725ff05a97b0139c6	We present the three approaches submitted to the Spoken Web Search. Two of them rely on Acoustic Keyword Spotting (AKWS) while the other relies on Dynamic Time Warping. Features are 3-state phone posterior. Results suggest that applying a Karhunen-Loeve transform to the log-phone posteriors representing the query to build a GMM/HMM for each query and a subsequent AKWS system performs the best.
5834868625ff05a97b0117c8	This paper describes recent work on manipulation strategies that rely on “coarse-fine” robot hardware and direct sensing of part-workpiece relationships. The experiments reported use an extremely precise, high-bandwidth planar “wrist” and an industrial vision system to perform accurate alignment of small parts. The system architecture, experimental hardware, and programming methods employed are all discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b0117d6	The authors present a force-reflecting teleoperation system. The system consists of a conventional manipulator equipped with a magnetically levitated teleoperation master identical to the wrist. Aspects of mechanical, system, computational, and controller design are discussed. An approach to the design of force-reflecting teleoperation controllers is also discussed. Admittance matrices and the parameterization of all stabilizing teleoperation system controllers are used to guarantee teleoperation system performance and stability.
5834868625ff05a97b013099	Despite significant advances in recognition technologies in areas such as speech and gesture recognition, our experience tells us that recognition errors and uncertainty are unlikely to disappear. For the foreseeable future, use of recognition based systems will introduce uncertainty into the input process. If interactive systems are going to work robustly with recognition-based input, it will be necessary to consider uncertainty as a normal part of input handling rather than considering it to be an anomaly or an exceptional condition.
5834868625ff05a97b0112b7	This paper describes a multi-site project to annotate six sizable bilingual parallel corpora for interlingual content. After presenting the background and objectives of the effort, we describe the data set that is being annotated, the interlingua representation language used, an interface environment that supports the annotation task and the annotation process itself. We then present our evaluation methodology and conclude with a summary of the current status of the project along with a number of issues which have arisen.
5834868625ff05a97b011fbc	There are many ways to implement variable code; some have been used long before the advent of software product lines. Even a simple if statement offers a choice between different execution paths. To prevent cluttering of code with if statements, to enhance feature traceability, to provide extensibility without the need to change the original source code, and to provide compile-time (or load-time) variability, developers have identified many common programming patterns to support variability.

5834868625ff05a97b01121d	This paper presents a demonstration of a temporal reasoning system that addresses three fundamental tasks related to temporal expressions in text: extraction, normalization to time intervals and comparison. Our system makes use of an existing state-of-the-art temporal extraction system, on top of which we add several important novel contributions. In addition, we demonstrate that our system can perform temporal reasoning by comparing normalized temporal expressions with respect to several temporal relations.
5834868625ff05a97b0127d2	We present the first model of optimal voting under adversarial noise. From this viewpoint, voting rules are seen as error-correcting codes: their goal is to correct errors in the input rankings and recover a ranking that is close to the ground truth. We derive worst-case bounds on the relation between the average accuracy of the input votes, and the accuracy of the output ranking. Empirical results from real data show that our approach produces significantly more accurate rankings than alternative approaches.
5834868625ff05a97b0112ca	Multimedia communication is a part of everyday life and its appearance in computer applications is increasing in frequency and diversity. This article defines the area, outlines fundamental research questions, summarizes the history of this technology, identifies current challenges and concludes by predicting future breakthroughs and discussing multilinguality. We conclude describing several new research issues that systems of systems raise.
5834868625ff05a97b012125	If robotic assistants are to be successful, people will need appropriate mental models of what these robots can do and how they operate. We are developing techniques for measuring people's mental models of interactive robots and social agents. We aim to measure the content of these models--if they are anthropomorphic or mechanistic--and the richness of these models (how elaborate or sparse they are; how much confidence people have in them). We report progress here.
5834868625ff05a97b01212f	1. The authors investigated basic properties of social exchange and interaction with technology in an experiment on cooperation with a human-like computer partner or a real human partner. Talking with a computer partner may trigger social identity feelings or commitment norms. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma game with a confederate or a computer partner. Discussion, inducements to make promises, and partner cooperation varied across trials. On Trial 1, after discussion, most participants proposed cooperation.
5834868625ff05a97b011fd9	Software product lines aim at empowering software vendors to tailor software products to the requirements of individual customers. In this sense, software product lines follow a development that emerged in industrial manufacturing over the last 200 years. Starting with handcrafting of individual goods, the advent of mass production scaled the production process to large quantities, but neglected individualism, as all products were the same. With mass customization, individualism got back into the focus of attention.
5834868625ff05a97b0112ee	Departing from your principles is hard. The frequency and volume with which the principles of statistical and symbolic MT were repeated during the Statistics Wars means impressive-sounding arguments will continue for a while. But it is perhaps more instructive to consider what happens in practice. Baldly stated, if you want to build a non-toy MT system-a system with more than approximately 5,000 lexical items-that handles previously unseen input robustly, you always end up including some statistics-based modules or knowledge.
5834868625ff05a97b011fdb	Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a paradigm that incorporates programming language technology, program generation techniques, and stepwise refinement. In their GPCE'07 paper, Thaker et al. suggest the development of a type system for FOP in order to guarantee safe feature composition. We present such a type system along with a calculus for a simple feature-oriented, Java-like language, called Feature Featherweight Java (FFJ). Furthermore, we explore several extensions of FFJ and how they affect type soundness.
5834868725ff05a97b01508e	More than 10% of the population has dyslexia, and most are diagnosed only after they fail in school. This work seeks to change this through scalable early detection via machine learning models that predict reading and writing difficulties by watching how people interact with a linguistic web-based game: Dytective. The design of Dytective is based on (i) the empirical linguistic analysis of the errors that people with dyslexia make,(ii) principles of language acquisition, and (iii) specific linguistic skills related to dyslexia.
5834868725ff05a97b0150c6	In this paper, we present the key functionalities of HearSay 3, a non-visual web browser designed with the goal of improving web accessibility across the world. The featured functionalities include transparent support for multiple languages, collaborative labeling that harnesses the power of the social web, and a usable interface for handling dynamic web content.
5834868625ff05a97b0127e6	Previous efforts involving picture-based passwords have not focused on maintaining a measurably high level of entropy. Since password systems usually allow user selection of passwords, their true entropy remains unknown. A 23-participant study was performed in which picture and character-based passwords of equal strength were randomly assigned. Memorability was tested with up to one week between sessions. The study found that both character and picture passwords of very high entropy were easily forgotten.

We conclude describing several new research issues that systems of systems raise.
5834868525ff05a97b00f5be	Because of polysemy, distant labeling for information extraction leads to noisy training data. We describe a procedure for reducing this noise by using label propagation on a graph in which the nodes are entity mentions, and mentions are coupled when they occur in coordinate list structures. We show that this labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers are used on the distantly-labeled data.
5834868625ff05a97b01201c	Data analysis involves both manipulation, via formulas and computations, and interpretation of the results. During the period immediately following World War II, particularly in the United States, statistical theory was consumed with the logic of statistical inference and decision-making. Against this backdrop, John Tukey revolted.
5834868725ff05a97b013b0c	Amulet is a new user interface software environment for C++ on X/11, Microsoft Windows NT or 95, and the Macintosh, which facilitates user interface research by being very open and flexible. In particular, new constraint and undo algorithms can be added, the widgets can modified and replaced, and support is provided for building high-level tools.
5834868625ff05a97b0112cc	This is the first workshop to cover semantic computing the context of security and privacy, and we believe that it is an excellent opportunity for new research and development. The two fields have synergistic potential and can open the door to a variety of multi-disciplinary investigations.
5834868625ff05a97b012b7d	This artifact contains: the SQPyte prototype, a JIT for executing SQLite queries; and PyPy-SQPyte, a version of the PyPy Python VM which embeds SQPyte. In addition, a benchmark suite is included, which allows performance comparison against standard SQLite and the Java embedded database H2.
5834868725ff05a97b013b1a	The visualizations of the Whyline are presented, which focus on supporting the exploration a source code and how it executes. The visualization is concise, simple to navigate, and mimics syntactic features of its target programming language for consistency. Two studies showed that users with the visualization completed a debugging task twice as fast as users without the visualization, partly due to features of the visualization. Applications of the visualizations to tasks other than debugging are discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b012b85	Programming languages often include specialized syntax for common datatypes (eg lists) and some also build in support for specific specialized datatypes (eg regular expressions), but user-defined types must use general-purpose syntax. Frustration with this causes developers to use strings, rather than structured data, with alarming frequency, leading to correctness, performance, security, and usability issues. Allowing library providers to modularly extend a language with new syntax could help address these issues.
5834868525ff05a97b00ebee	On the basis of investigation of crew scheduling operation in the XI'AN Railway Passenger Transport Depot, aimed at the outstanding problems and the actual requirements, it was designed and developed the Railway Passenger Crew Scheduling System. The System could generate day crew plan and month crew plan according to the designed crew scheduling rules. Moreover, the System had functions of work appointment, work attendance, report statistics etc.
5834868625ff05a97b011335	A problem faced by microplanners in language generation systems is what information should be placed in clauseinitial position, and why. We identify two principal communicative functions associated with this position and define concepts that enable microplanning rules to be built.
5834868625ff05a97b01133b	This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop 11331 “The Future of Research Communication”. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together researchers from these different disciplines, whose core research goal is changing the formats, standards, and means by which we communicate science.
5834868625ff05a97b0121fb	The C preprocessor is often used in practice to implement variability in software product lines. Using# ifdef statements provokes problems such as obfuscated source code, yet they will still be used in practice at least in the medium-term future. With CIDE, we demonstrate a tool to improve understanding and maintaining code that contains# ifdef statements by visualizing them with colors and providing different views on the code.
5834868725ff05a97b015225	Changes that bring together nanotechnology, information science, biology, and cognition have the potential to revolutionize the way we work and organize society. A large number of outcomes are possible. At the same time, existing social forms, legislation and culture will limit and direct the potential outcomes. In a very real sense, technologies and societies, tools and cultures, capabilities and legislation will co-evolve. Without attempting to predict the future, a series of possible outcomes, issues, and research challenges are discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b012b8b	Accurately assessing the quality of one's work is a crucial skill for professional designers and design students alike. This paper describes teaching materials that help students self-assess their work in a design course at a large university in the US. Using these materials, students have been successful in evaluating themselves—in 69% of all weekly student submissions, self-assessed scores matched independent staff-assessments. Self-assessment accuracy also improved through the term (F (1; 1332)= 31: 72; p< 0: 001).
5834868725ff05a97b015272	We present a statistic-based summarization method with MMR that yields the clear and condense results for a web search engine called Condor. We compare the results with the summaries generated by human subjects. For the comparison, we use FScore and cosine similarities. Our experimental results verify the accuracy of the summarization methods in Condor.
5834868625ff05a97b0118bf	We present initial findings from an experiment in which participants played Mafia, an established role-playing game, with our robot. In one condition, the robot played like the rest of the participants and, in the other, the robot moderated the game. We discuss general aspects of the interaction, participants' perceptions, and the potential of this scenario for studying group spatial behavior from robotic platforms.
5834868725ff05a97b015278	This paper describes the two Story Link Detection systems Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed, and examines why their performance on the evaluation data was considerably worse than expected while performance on an alternate evaluation set matched the performance on the training data.
5834868625ff05a97b011368	The majority of current computational work on discourse is inspired by a single basic observation: discourse exhibits internal structure. In text and dialogues, some portions are related more closely than others. The nature of this relatedness-is it semantic, thematic, intentional, interlocutororiented, or what?-is not yet clear, and different opinions give rise to different theories. From the computational perspective, three questions arise.
5834868625ff05a97b012280	ABSTRACT. We summarize results on asymptotic approximation of integrals arising in Bayesian statistics. The primary motivation for this work is the need for integration methods that can be applied in interactive Bayesian data analysis. The approximations we discuss can be easily and rapidly computed and are often sufficiently accurate to be useful.
5834868625ff05a97b012400	A close relationship exists between the advancement of face recognition algorithms and the availability of face databases varying factors that affect facial appearance in a controlled manner. The CMU PIE database has been very influential in advancing research in face recognition across pose and illumination. Despite its success the PIE database has several shortcomings: a limited number of subjects, a single recording session and only few expressions captured. To address these issues we collected the CMU Multi-PIE database.
5834868625ff05a97b011371	This paper describes a novel summarization system, Classummary, for interactive online classroom discussions. This system is originally designed for Open Source Software (OSS) development forums. However, this new application provides valuable feedback on designing summarization systems and applying them to everyday use, in addition to the traditional natural language processing evaluation methods. In our demonstration at HLT, new users will be able to direct this summarizer themselves.
5834868625ff05a97b0123f1	Passive sensing of human hand and limb motion is important for a wide range of applications from human-computer interaction to athletic performance measurement. High degree of freedom articulated mechanisms like the human hand are difficult to track because of their large state space and complex image appearance. This article describes a model-based hand tracking system, called DigitEyes, that can recover the state of a 27 DOF hand model from ordinary gray scale images at speeds of up to 10 Hz.
5834868625ff05a97b0131c7	Based on our analysis of entertaining multiparty conversations, participants tend to obey the cooperative conversational principle, and provide feedback so as to understand the current topic. In addition, they also speak to express their own idea and interest. In this paper, we describe a conversational robot system designed for constantly facilitating conversations with topic tracing capability, which is able to output a combination of answers to questions and spontaneous utterances.
5834868625ff05a97b0118ae	While touchscreens allow extensive programmability and have become ubiquitous in today's gadgetry, such configurations lack the tactile sensations and feedback that physical buttons provide. As a result, these devices require more attention to use than their button-enabled counterparts. Still, the displays provide the ultimate interface flexibility and thus afford a much larger design space to application developers.
5834868625ff05a97b012bfb	This paper presents the techniques that we have been developing recently to solve the problem of path clearance. In the path clearance problem the robot needs to reach its goal as quickly as possible without being detected by enemies. The problem is complicated by the fact that the robot does not know the precise locations of enemies, but has a list of their possible locations. Either the robot itself or scout robots can be used to sense these possible enemy locations before the robot traverses through them on the way to its goal.
5834868625ff05a97b0118c8	Despite significant advances in recognition technologies in areas such as speech and gesture recognition, our experience tells us that recognition errors and uncertainty are unlikely to disappear. For the foreseeable future, use of recognition based systems will introduce uncertainty into the input process. If interactive systems are going to work robustly with recognition-based input, it will be necessary to consider uncertainty as a normal part of input handling rather than considering it to be an anomaly or an exceptional condition.
5834868525ff05a97b010d1a	With aniline and salicylaldehyde as main materials, a new collector for wolframite slime was synthesized. In a pulp of natural pH value, this collector can collect wolframite effectively. Its selectivity is similar to that of benzyl arsenic acid and better than that of sodium oleate. With this collector, a wolframite rough concentrate with grade 30.12% WO3 and recovery 91.50%, and a concentrate with grade 58.66% WO3 and recovery 85.00% were obtained respectively from a wolframite ore containing 4.08% WO3.
5834868725ff05a97b013bb6	Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising memory technology that can offer higher memory capacity than DRAM. Unfortunately, PCM's access latency and energy are higher than DRAM and its endurance is lower. DRAM-PCM hybrid memory systems [1–4] use DRAM as a cache to PCM to achieve the low access latency and energy, and high endurance of DRAM, while taking advantage of the large PCM capacity.
5834868625ff05a97b012c4a	This paper presents a thorough theoretical analysis of a recently developed anytime incremental planning algorithm called Anytime Dynamic A*(AD*). The analysis includes proofs for the correctness of the algorithm and as well as the proofs for several properties of the algorithm related to its efficiency.

Based on the differences between modified acrylic and common acrylic, especially in anti-pilling property, it can be found that the anti-pilling property of the modified acrylic fiber becomes much better after many experiments have been done.
5834868525ff05a97b00f281	CATS–Clustering After Transformation and Smoothing–is a technique for nonparametrically estimating and clustering a large number of curves. Our motivating example is a genetic microarray experiment but the method is very general. The method includes: transformation and smoothing multiple curves, multiple nonparametric testing for screening out flat curves, clustering curves with similar shape, and nonparametrically inferring the clustering estimation error rate.
5834868625ff05a97b011946	Abstract—Localization and mapping are essential capabilities of virtually all mobile robots. These topics have been the focus of a great deal of research, but it is not always easy to tell which methods are best. This paper discusses performance evaluation for an important sub-problem of robot mapping, map optimization. We explore aspects underlying the evaluation of map optimization such as the quality of the result and computational complexity. For each aspect we discuss evaluation metrics and provide specific recommendations.
5834868625ff05a97b0127a8	By combining algorithmic learning, decision procedures, and predicate abstraction, we present an automated technique for finding loop invariants in propositional formulae. Given invariant approximations derived from pre-and post-conditions, our new technique exploits the flexibility in invariants by a simple randomized mechanism. The proposed technique is able to generate invariants for some Linux device drivers and SPEC2000 benchmarks in our experiments.

5834868625ff05a97b01286e	A novel method of using task fingerprinting to predict outcome measures such quality, errors, and the likelihood of cheating, particularly as applied to crowd sourced tasks. The technique focuses on the way workers work rather than the products they produce. The technique captures behavioral traces from online crowd workers and uses them to build predictive models of task performance. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated across three contexts including classification, generation, and comprehension tasks.

This is important because many AI systems have to adapt their plans continuously to changes in (their knowledge of) the world. In this article, we give an overview of incremental search, focusing on LIFELONG PLANNING A*, and outline some of its possible applications in AI.

5834868625ff05a97b01156b	This sensor-based approach for registration and stacking of electronic substrate sublaminates replaces pin-in-slot methods, yet does not require accurate automation equipment. Tests of a pilot workcell for this approach showed that the contact holes were consistently aligned to 2.5/spl mu/m (3/spl sigma/), more than ten times better than the traditional mechanical method.
5834868625ff05a97b011a72	New input technologies (such as touch), recognition based input (such as pen gestures) and next-generation interactions (such as inexact interaction) all hold the promise of more natural user interfaces. However, these techniques all create inputs with some uncertainty. Unfortunately, conventional infrastructure lacks a method for easily handling uncertainty, and as a result input produced by these technologies is often converted to conventional events as quickly as possible, leading to a stunted interactive experience.
5834868625ff05a97b01180b	A primary feature of a computer program is its quantitative performance characteristics: the amount of resources such as time, memory, and power the program needs to perform its task. Concrete resource bounds for specific hardware have many important applications in software development but their manual determination is tedious and error-prone. This dissertation studies the problem of automatically determining concrete worstcase bounds on the quantitative resource consumption of functional programs.
5834868625ff05a97b012a9b	We present a stereo vision-aided inertial navigation system and demonstrate its potential in power line inspection at close range using an unmaned aerial vehicle. This is made possible by recent developments in visual odometry and a newly proposed algorithm for the loose coupling of an inertial measurement unit and visual odometry. Our experiments show promising results.
5834868725ff05a97b013958	We present a novel approach for multi-robot distributed and incremental inference over variables of interest, such as robot trajectories, considering the initial relative poses between the robots and multi-robot data association are both unknown. Assuming robots share with each other informative observations, this inference problem is formulated within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization, performed by each robot separately, alternating between inference over variables of interest and multi-robot data association.
5834868625ff05a97b0127e9	Computer security warnings are intended to protect users and their computers. However, research suggests that these warnings might be largely ineffective because they're frequently ignored. The authors describe a mental model interview study designed to gain insight into how advanced and novice computer users perceive and respond to computer warnings. Developers can leverage the approaches of advanced users to design more effective warnings for novice users.
5834868625ff05a97b010fae	With the growth of adaptive educational systems available for students, semantic integration of user modeling information from these systems is emerging into an important practical task. Ontologies can serve as the major representational framework for such integration. However, not all adaptive systems rely on ontologies for representing domain knowledge. In this paper, we report an experiment on integration of domain models of two different adaptive systems.
5834868625ff05a97b012365	In this paper, we outline a low cost multi-robot autonomous platform for a broad set of applications including water quality monitoring, flood disaster mitigation and depth buoy verification. By working cooperatively, fleets of vessels can cover large areas that would otherwise be impractical, time consuming and prohibitively expensive to traverse by a single vessel. We describe the hardware design, control infrastructure, and software architecture of the system, while additionally presenting experimental results from several field trials.

5834868625ff05a97b011a7a	Because researchers embed successful ubicomp projects in rich real-world contexts that can touch many aspects of life, they've made multidisciplinary teams the norm rather than the exception. However, overcoming boundaries between various disciplines is a significant challenge and in many cases represents a key factor for successful development. Problem-solving approaches differ radically, and finding common ground for assessing results can be difficult.

5834868525ff05a97b00f31e	This paper extends the theory of false discovery rates (FDR) pioneered by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). We give statistical models underlying multiple testing in the independent, continuous case. We define the realized FDR and False Nondiscovery Rate (FNR) as stochastic processes and characterize their asymptotic behavior. We develop methods for estimating the p-value distribution, even in the non-identifiable case. We also develop a new method for controlling the probability of a large realized FDR.
5834868625ff05a97b011533	Wearables have been with us for a long time, and they're here to stay. Their capabilities and our expectations change with time, but many of the basic problems remain. This issue touches on designing for unpredictable human behavior, positioning sensors, powering wearables without removing the device from the body, and providing text input on very small displays.

5834868725ff05a97b013c37	The goal of methods for ligand acidification by nonadherent cells is to obtain nearly continuous measurements of the pH to which a receptor-bound ligand is exposed after endocytosis. The protocols presented below are based on the method developed by Sipe and Murphy [1] for adherent (BALB/c3T3) cells and modified by Sipe et al.[2] for nonadherent (K562) cells. Reviews of acidification of endocytic compartments [3, 4] and flow cytometric methods for analysis of endocytosis [5, 6] may be consulted for additional background.
5834868525ff05a97b00f65a	A new application of steel sprayed tooling for the manufacture of prototype permanent molds for aluminum casting is discussed in this paper. The prototype tooling is quickly made by spraying onto substrates that define the tooling shell shape. The shell material, structure, and geometry are adequate to withstand, for a limited number of pours, the demands placed on an aluminum permanent mold. An initial demonstration shows the promise of this method.

5834868525ff05a97b00e865	In order to verify the ignition and combustion performances of the metal-powder fuel ramjet, preliminary direct-connected test for the motor was carried out. The results show that the designed fuel supply system can effectively deliver powder fuel into the motor chamber. Powder fuel can be rapidly ignited by means of the torch. After ignition, the fuel can keep burning. There is a lot of deposition on the wall of chamber, which is divided into two layers; surface layer is white MgO, and inner layer is mixture of Mg, MgO and Mg3N2.

5834868625ff05a97b011213	Understanding smartphone users is fundamental for creating better smartphones, and improving the smartphone usage experience and generating generalizable and reproducible research. However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users.
5834868725ff05a97b0148c6	How can we detect suspicious users in large online networks? Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users.
5834868625ff05a97b012045	In this paper we present a Bayesian analysis of location-scale regression models assuming standard lifetime distributions and an additional error term with a mixture of normal distributions. Considering a censored lifetime data set, we use Gibbs sampling with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to get Bayesian quantities of interest. The proposed regression model gives a great flexibility to fit lifetime data as we see in an example.

5834868625ff05a97b01349f	It has been long recognised in education that teaching and learning is a highly social and emotional activity. Students' cognitive progress depends on their psychological predispositions such as their interest, confidence, sense of progress and achievement as well as on social interactions with their teachers and peers who provide them (or not) with both cognitive and emotional support. Until recently the ability to recognise students' socio-affective needs constituted exclusively the realm of human tutors' social competence.
5834868625ff05a97b0130a4	Peripheral displays are an important application for enabling people to be constantly aware of information while doing other activities. How does one evaluate a peripheral awareness display to determine if it provides awareness without distracting the user inappropriately from other tasks? We explore evaluation metrics for peripheral displays and describe proposed support to be added to an existing toolkit for creating peripheral display prototypes.

5834868625ff05a97b011d27	LASSIE (Landmark Acquisition SubSystem Improving Exploration) is a program which recognizes a car from several points of view. Trapezoids are formed from groups of lines extracted from a color image; instances of the car model are found by searching for sets of trapezoids which fit the constraints between parts of the car such as the windows, roof, and trunk. No information is used about the dimensions of the various parts, setting LASSIE apart from many other programs which use features extracted from images to recognize objects.

5834868725ff05a97b0138d7	Current approaches to inductive concept learning suffer from a fundamental difficulty; if a fixed language is chosen in which to represent concepts, then in cases where that language is inappropriate, the new concept may be impossible to describe (and therefore to learn). We suggest a framework for automatically extending the language in which concepts are to be expressed. This framework includes multiple sources of knowledge for recommending plausible language extensions.
5834868625ff05a97b011759	Despite many sensor, hardware, networking, and software advances, it is still quite difficult to build effective and reliable context-aware applications. We propose to build a context infrastructure that provides three things to simplify the task of building context-aware applications: a context data store for modeling, storing, and distributing context data; a context specification language for declaratively stating and processing context needs; and protection mechanisms for safeguarding privacy needs.
5834868625ff05a97b011769	Phishing attacks involve three major phases: The first is potential victims receiving a phish; the second is the victim taking the suggested action in the message, usually to go to a fake Web site but can also include installing malware or replying with sensitive information; and the third is the criminal monetizing stolen information.
5834868625ff05a97b0132a8	Computer scientists have a role to play in combating global climate change. Global climate change is one of the most pressing problems of our time.

5834868625ff05a97b0126f8	We present an algorithm for planning safe navigation strategies for biped robots moving in obstacle-cluttered environments. From a discrete set of plausible statically-stable, single-step motions, a forward dynamic programming approach is used to compute a sequence of feasible footstep locations. In contrast to existing navigation strategies for mobile robots, our method is a global method that takes into account the unique ability of legged robots such as bipedal humanoids to traverse obstacles by stepping over them.

5834868625ff05a97b012704	We apply manipulation planning to computer animation. A new path planner is presented that automatically computes the collision-free trajectories for several cooperating arms to manipulate a movable object between two configurations. This implemented planner is capable of dealing with complicated tasks where regrasping is involved. In addition, we present a new inverse kinematics algorithm for the human arms. This algorithm is utilized by the planner for the generation of realistic human arm motions as they manipulate objects.

We apply Maximum Entropy classification with feature sets of syntactic patterns from parse trees and officially attain 80.2% precision and 65.4% recall. When the frame element boundaries are given, the system performs 86.7% precision and 85.8% recall.
5834868625ff05a97b012b96	Smartphones and other handheld devices have become popular and powerful Internet access devices, yet the Web is still largely optimized for the desktop. We describe a system that automatically transforms desktop-optimized pages to ones better suited to the target device. The system leverages existing platform-customized sites as examples of good design, identifies consistent components across these sites, and renders the desktop page into these components.

5834868725ff05a97b013c9e	In the past ten years, augmentative communication has become a factor in vocational rehabilitation. A history of augmentative communication is presented, as well as the role that vocational rehabilitation counselors can and often do play in the evaluation and implementation of an augmentative communication system.
5834868625ff05a97b0119c4	Many locomotion tasks on real, complex terrain are poorly modeled as deviations from limit cycles of steady state running. As obstacles become larger and larger relative to leg length, every step is novel and challenging: the leap onto a ledge in Fig. 1 is quite unlike any running step. We seek to organize and systematically reduce this space to a finite set of dynamic transition “words” in order to enable dramatic outdoor transitional behaviors.

5834868625ff05a97b011669	With massive social media data, eg, comments, blog articles, or tweets, become available, there is a rising interest towards automatic metaphor detection from open social text. One of the most well-known approaches is detecting the violation of selectional preference. The idea of selectional preference is that verbs tend to have semantic preferences of their arguments. If we find that in some text, any arguments of these predicates are not of their preferred semantic classes, and it's very likely to be a metaphor.
5834868625ff05a97b012b98	This paper describes two diagnostic tools to predict students are at risk of dropping out from an online class. While thousands of students have been attracted to large online classes, keeping them motivated has been challenging. Experiments on a large, online HCI class suggest that the tools these paper introduces can help identify students who will not complete assignments, with an F 1 score of 0.46 and 0.73 three days before the assignment due date.
5834868625ff05a97b011cab	In this thesis, we study the topic of ambiguity when detecting object instances in scenes with severe clutter and occlusions. Our work focuses on the three key areas:(1) objects that have ambiguous features,(2) objects where discriminative point-based features cannot be reliably extracted, and (3) occlusions.

We detail the problem of interest, discuss system requirements, and provide an overview of our approach. The remainder of the paper is dedicated to the system design and evaluation on a team of quadrotors in simulation and experiments.
5834868625ff05a97b0122a0	The joint peristimulus time histogram (JPSTH) and cross-correlogram provide a visual representation of correlated activity for a pair of neurons, and the way this activity may increase or decrease over time. In a companion paper we showed how a Bootstrap evaluation of the peaks in the smoothed diagonals of the JPSTH may be used to establish the likely validity of apparent time-varying correlation. As noted in earlier studies by Brody and Ben-Shaul et al., trial-to-trial variation can confound correlation and synchrony effects.
5834868625ff05a97b012bd6	In this paper, we propose a long-term motion model for visual object tracking. In crowded street scenes, persistent occlusions are a frequent challenge for tracking algorithm and a robust, long-term motion model could help in these situations. Motivated by progresses in robot motion planning, we propose to construct a set of 'plausible'plans for each person, which are composed of multiple long-term motion prediction hypotheses that do not include redundancies, unnecessary loops or collisions with other objects.
5834868525ff05a97b00f22f	The main task of this study is to establish if a separate low-falling tone could be recognized as Tone-3 in Mandarin. Sixty listeners with different language backgrounds take part in the experiment. Their perception of twelve end-fixed falling pitch contours is reported. The results show that Chinese participants do not perceive low-falling tones as Tone-3; however, both Thai and the other foreign listeners do.

5834868625ff05a97b011e38	We sought to understand basic properties of social exchange and how people interact with technology in an experiment on how people respond in a dilemma game with a computer partner varying in human-like attributes as compared with a real human partner. Explanations of cooperation following discussion in dilemmas draw on theories of human social identity and social contract. We proposed that talking with a computer partner triggers social identity feelings and commitment norms people typically follow in decisions.
5834868625ff05a97b011f31	Research has linked in-car cell phone use with automobile accidents. We explore a signaling method that could mitigate that risk. We show in a first experiment how remote cell phone callers were induced to speak less during critical driving periods, and, in a second experiment, how driving performance in a simulator improved when callers reduced conversation levels during critical driving periods.
5834868625ff05a97b012e56	This paper demonstrates tremor compensation for human subjects using an active handheld micromanipulator. This instrument uses optical and inertial sensing to detect its own motion, estimates tremor using linear filtering, and a flexure-based manipulator to actuate the tip. Compensation results while tracing a line with the tool are presented for both novice users and a trained surgeon. Learning effects from repetition of the trials over a ten-day period are described.
5834868625ff05a97b01124c	近些年, P2P 点播系统(P2P-VoD) 受到广泛关注, 其大多研究工作基于理论性的传统假设, 这些假设在真实的系统中是如何表现的不得而知. 因此, 在真实P2P-VoD 系统中对传统假设进行全面的测量和验证就显得十分迫切. 对实际运行的P2P-VoD 系统CoolFish 进行了大量的测量与分析, 发现了一些不同于以往假设的结果: 节点加入不是简单地服从泊松分布; 观看时间和影片流行度不呈严格的正相关性; 跳转频率和影片流行度不呈负相关. 最后对这些结果进行了深入的分析和讨论.

5834868625ff05a97b012803	Background Knowledge of concepts and procedures seems to develop in an iterative fashion, with increases in one type of knowledge leading to increases in the other type of knowledge. This suggests that iterating between lessons on concepts and procedures may improve learning. Aims The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the instructional benefits of an iterative lesson sequence compared to a concepts-before-procedures sequence for students learning decimal place-value concepts and arithmetic procedures.
5834868625ff05a97b012132	Multi-university collaborations draw on diverse resources and expertise, but they impose coordination costs for bridging institutional differences and geographic distance. We report a study of the coordination activities and project outcomes of 491 research collaborations funded by the US National Science Foundation. Coordination activities, especially division of responsibility for tasks and knowledge transfer among investigators, predicted project outcomes (eg, producing new knowledge, creating new tools, and training students).
5834868625ff05a97b011360	Computer simulation has been an important technique to capture the dynamics of biochemical networks. In most networks, however, few kinetic parameters have been measured in vivo because of experimental complexity. We develop a kinetic parameter estimation system, named the CADLIVE Optimizer, which comprises genetic algorithms-based solvers with a graphical user interface. This optimizer is integrated into the CADLIVE Dynamic Simulator to attain efficient simulation for dynamic models.
5834868625ff05a97b012181	In this report we present an overview of our investigation into constructing motion templates. We start with a successful implementation of elementary concepts that worked well on previous projects, then proceed with a generalization of that approach through a study of spatial distinctness of the same type of paths, and finally present a further generalization that looks at all possible motions through space.
5834868625ff05a97b0113d2	Headline summarization is a difficult task because it requires maximizing text content in short summary length while maintaining grammaticality.

5834868625ff05a97b0119f2	We present a prototypical implementation of a partial evaluator for Java programs based on the verification system KeY. We argue that using a program verifier as technological basis provides potential benefits leading to a higher degree of specialization. We discuss in particular how loop invariants and preconditions can be exploited to specialize programs. In addition, we provide the first results which we achieved with the presented tool.

5834868725ff05a97b0137b9	A step is taken towards fusing symbolic and decision-theoretic problem solving in a cognitive architecture by implementing the latter in an architecture within which the former has already been demonstrated. The graphical models upon which the architecture is based enable a uniform implementation of both varieties of problem solving. They also enable a uniform combination with forms of decision-relevant perception, highlighting a potential path towards a tight coupling between central cognition and peripheral perception.
5834868625ff05a97b0126b8	We explore the use of computational optimal control techniques for automated construction of policies in complex dynamic environments. Our implementation of dynamic programming is performed in a reduced dimensional subspace of a simulated four-DOF biped robot with point feet.

5834868625ff05a97b011291	Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical investigations. However, the gap between dropout's training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis.
5834868625ff05a97b011292	We introduce a novel approach for resolving coreference when the trigger word refers to multiple (sometimes non-contiguous) clauses. Our approach is completely unsupervised, and our experiments show that Neural Network models perform much better (about 20% more accurate) than traditional feature-rich baseline models. We also present a new dataset for Biomedical Language Processing which, with only about 25% of the original corpus vocabulary, still captures the essential distributional semantics of the corpus.
5834868625ff05a97b011fde	SugarJ is a Java-based programming language that provides extensible surface syntax, static analyses, and IDE support. SugarJ extensions are organized as libraries; conventional import statements suffice to activate and compose language extensions. We demonstrate how programmers can use SugarJ to modularly extend Java's syntax, semantic analyses and IDE support.
5834868625ff05a97b011fe7	Feature-oriented software development is a paradigm for the construction, customization, and synthesis of large-scale and variable software systems, focusing on structure, reuse and variation. In this tutorial, we provide a gentle introduction to software product lines, feature oriented programming, virtual separation of concerns, and variability-aware analysis. We provide an overview, show connections between the different lines of research, and highlight possible future research directions.
5834868625ff05a97b011fe9	It is common believe that separating source code along concerns or features improves program comprehension of source code. However, empirical evidence is mostly missing. In this paper, we design a controlled experiment to evaluate that believe for feature-oriented programming based on maintenance tasks with human participants. We validate our experiment with a pilot study, which already preliminarily confirms that students use different strategies to complete maintenance tasks.
5834868625ff05a97b0125f1	Wikipedia and open source software projects have been cited as canonical examples of collectively intelligent organizations. Both organizations rely on large crowds of contributors to create knowledge goods. The crowds that emerge in both cases are not flat, but form a core-periphery network in which a few leaders contribute a large portion of the production and coordination work. This paper explores the social network processes by which leaders emerge from crowd-based organizations.

5834868625ff05a97b012a50	We describe an annotation scheme for syntactic information in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), which contains several megabytes of transcribed dialogs between parents and children. The annotation scheme is based on grammatical relations (GRs) that are composed of bilexical dependencies (between a head and a dependent) labeled with the name of the relation involving the two words (such as subject, object and adjunct). We also discuss automatic annotation using our syntactic annotation scheme.

5834868625ff05a97b0125ed	In this article, we examine online community design in light of the common identity and common bond theory in social psychology. We review literature on the antecedents and consequences of two types of attachment--attachment to the group as a whole and attachment to individual members--to inform critical design tradeoffs, such as discussion moderation, community growth, and communication mechanisms.
5834868625ff05a97b012dea	We introduce a soft-matter sensor that measures elastic pressure and shear deformation. The sensor is composed of a sheet of elastomer that is embedded with fluidic parallel-plate capacitors. When the elastomer is pressed or sheared, the electrodes of the embedded capacitors come closer together or slide past each other, respectively, leading to a change in capacitance. The magnitude and direction of the shear deformation is established by comparing the change in capacitance of multiple embedded capacitors.
5834868725ff05a97b0138fa	The Meta-DENDRAL program is described in general terms that are intended to clarify the similarities and differences to other learning programs. Its approach of model-directed heuristic search through a complex space of possible rules appears well suited to many induction tasks. The use of a strong model of the domain to direct the rule search has been demonstrated for rule formation in two areas of chemistry. The high performance of programs which use the generated rules attests to the success of this learning strategy.
5834868725ff05a97b015554	A thread is a unit of execution, associated with a process, with its own thread ID, stack, stack pointer, program counter, condition codes, and general-purpose registers. Multiple threads associated with a process run concurrently in the context of that process, sharing its code, data, heap, shared libraries, signal handlers, and open files. Programming with threads instead of conventional processes is increasingly popular because threads are less expensive than processes and because they provide a trivial mechanism for sharing data.

5834868625ff05a97b0126eb	We present an online algorithm for planning sequences of footstep locations that encode goal-directed navigation strategies for humanoid robots. Planning footsteps is more general than most existing navigation methods designed for wheeled robots, since the options of stepping over or upon obstacles in a cluttered terrain are available. Given a discrete set of plausible footstep locations, a forward dynamic programming approach is used to compute a footstep sequence to a specified goal location in the environment.

5834868625ff05a97b0121b6	A method of odometry calibration is proposed and validated which is designed to be as convenient as possible. Convenience is enhanced by reducing both the amount of software to be written and the amount of measurements to be made to a minimum. The path dependent nature of odometry can be exploited to reduce the amount of ground truth information to as little as a single known point. Existing odometry and covariance estimation functions themselves would be used to extract first order parameter variation.
5834868725ff05a97b01383d	This article presents an, algorithm for performing early detection of disease outbreaks by searching a database of emergency department cases for anomalous patterns. Traditional techniques for anomaly detection are unsatisfactory for this problem because they identify individual data points that are rare due to particular combinations of features. Thus, these traditional algorithms discover isolated outliers of particularly strange events, such as someone accidentally shooting their ear, that are not indicative of a new outbreak.
5834868625ff05a97b0121b7	A computer-assisted method for localizing a rack, including sensing an image of the rack, detecting line segments in the sensed image, recognizing a candidate arrangement of line segments in the sensed image indicative of a predetermined feature of the rack, generating a matrix of correspondence between the candidate arrangement of line segments and an expected position and orientation of the predetermined feature of the rack, and estimating a position and orientation of the rack based on the matrix of correspondence.
5834868625ff05a97b0121ca	Vehicle odometry is a nonlinear dynamical system in echelon form. Accordingly, a general solution can be written by solving the nonlinear equations in the correct order. Another implication of this structure is that a completely general solution to the linearized (perturbative) dynamics exists. The associated vector convolution integral is the general relationship between the output error and both the input error and reference trajectory. Solutions for errors in individual coordinates are in the form of line integrals in state space.

5834868625ff05a97b0121d4	A small yield-point effect is found during interrupted tensile tests on single crystals of pure aluminum and nickel. The effect is most marked at low temperatures. Experiments have been carried out to determine the conditions under which the effect occurs, and these are correlated with those of other workers. It is concluded that the phenomenon is unlikely to be a strain-aging effect. An explanation is sought in terms of dislocation rearrangements during unloading.

However, reverts can also be damaging, especially to the aspiring editor whose work they destroy. In this research we analyze 400,000 Wikipedia revisions to understand the effect that reverts had on editors. We seek to understand the extent to which they demotivate users, reducing the workforce of contributors, versus the extent to which they help users improve as encyclopedia editors.

5834868625ff05a97b013195	Abstract—The visual estimation of the rank of a matrix has eluded researchers across a myriad of disciplines many years. In this paper, we demonstrate the successful visual estimation of a matrix's rank by treating it as a classification problem. When tested on a dataset of tens-of-thousands of colormapped matrices of varying ranks, we not only achieve state-of-the-art performance, but also distressingly high performance on an absolute basis.

This paper proposes a realization of stochastic Petri nets in SystemC for modeling large embedded control systems. Then statistical model checking is used to analyze the dependability of the constructed model. Our verification framework allows users to express a wide range of useful properties to be verified which is illustrated through a case study.

While researchers paid considerable efforts to enhance the performance and scalability of datacenter networks, achieving reliable data delivery in these emerging networks with misbehaving routers and switches received far less attention. Unfortunately, documented incidents of router compromise underscore that the capability to identify adversarial routers and switches is an imperative and practical need rather than merely a theoretical exercise.

A combination of qualitative simulation and empirical study can serve as a solution to the optimization problem. Firstly, we use mobile banking system as an example with questionnaire designed to obtain data from customers, which is then statistically analyzed using SPSS to examine the interactions among adoption drivers.
5834868725ff05a97b01537f	This paper examines what types of organizational structures are most effective during crisis, and least affected by crisis, as the level of training with the organization is varied. Many organizations are engaged in quasi-repetitive integrated decision making tasks in which similar problems occur one after the next but each problem is so complex that no one individual can access or analyze all pertinent information. In such organizations, training is vital as performance improves as individual decision makers gain experience.

5834868725ff05a97b0153ab	Background Trauma often cooccurs with cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock. Skin and muscle injuries often lead to significant inflammation in the affected tissue. The primary mechanism by which inflammation is initiated, sustained, and terminated is cytokine-mediated immune signaling, but this signaling can be altered by cardiac arrest. The complexity and context sensitivity of immune signaling in general has stymied a clear understanding of these signaling dynamics.

5834868625ff05a97b01277e	Navi is a three-wheeled autonomous robot that was designed, built, and programmed by members of Rutgers University's IEEE Student Branch. As the second iteration of the Navigator, Rutgers University's entry into the 2011 IGVC, Navi is the culmination of two years of planning, experience, and testing. It is specifically designed for navigating through unknown, outdoor environments such as those found in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC).
5834868625ff05a97b012791	By combining algorithmic learning, decision procedures, and predicate abstraction, we present an automated technique for finding loop invariants in propositional formulae. Given invariant approximations derived from pre-and post-conditions, our new technique exploits the flexibility in invariants by a simple randomized mechanism. The proposed technique is able to generate invariants for some Linux device drivers and SPEC2000 benchmarks in our experiments.

5834868625ff05a97b0127ac	We describe the open-source tool dReal, an SMT solver for nonlinear formulas over the reals. The tool can handle various nonlinear real functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc. dReal implements the framework of δ-complete decision procedures: It returns either unsat or δ-sat on input formulas, where δ is a numerical error bound specified by the user. dReal also produces certificates of correctness for both δ-sat (a solution) and unsat answers (a proof of unsatisfiability).
5834868725ff05a97b013f9f	An essential aspect of programmers' work is the correctness of their code. This makes current HCI techniques ill-suited to analyze and design the programming systems that programmers use everyday, since these techniques focus more on problems with learnability and efficiency of use, and less on error-proneness. We propose a framework and methodology that focuses specifically on errors by supporting the description and identification of the causes of software errors in terms of chains of cognitive breakdowns.
5834868525ff05a97b010f4a	A novel swept-laser-based Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography system using an electro-optic phase modulator was demonstrated. The imaging range was doubled by cancellation of the mirror image. The elimination of low-frequency noises resulting from dc and autocorrelation terms increased the sensitivity by 20 dB.
5834868725ff05a97b013fba	An overview is given of user-interface development systems (UIDS). Systems are classified by how they let the programmer specify the interfaces, and examples of each type are given. The three types are language-based, graphical, and automatic creation interfaces. Shortcomings of UIDS and user-interface toolkits are discussed.
5834868525ff05a97b010f54	This article presents perception and navigation systems for a family of autonomous orchard vehicles. The systems are customized to enable safe and reliable driving in modern planting environments. The perception system is based on a global positioning system (GPS)-free sensor suite composed of a twodimensional (2-D) laser scanner, wheel and steering encoders, and algorithms that process the sensor data and output the vehicle's location in the orchard and guidance commands for row following and turning.
5834868725ff05a97b013782	Agent-based models of organizations have traditionally had a single level of agency, whether at the individual or organizational level, but many interesting organizational phenomena, including organizational resilience and turnover, involve agency at multiple organizational levels. We propose an extensible multi-modeling framework, realized in software, to model these phenomena and many more. Two applications will be given to demonstrate the framework's versatility.
5834868725ff05a97b0153e2	We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training instances.

5834868725ff05a97b01550e	Analogical problem solving is mostly described as transfer of a source solution to a target problem based on the structural correspondences (mapping) between source and target. Derivational analogy (Carbonell, 1986) proposes an alternative view: A target problem is solved by replaying a remembered problem solving episode. Thus, the experience with the source problem is used to guide the search for the target solution by applying the same solution technique rather than by a transferring the complete solution.

5834868625ff05a97b0127c6	In this article, we first introduce the methodology for our recent work on password-composition policies [5, 6] and password meters [8], and define the metrics we used to measure the security and usability of passwords. We then highlight key results from these studies, paying particular attention to the lessons they hold for guiding real-world password creation.
5834868725ff05a97b013a0f	Speech recognition has advanced considerably, but has been limited almost entirely either to situations in which close speaking microphones are natural and acceptable (telephone, dictation, command&control, etc.) or in which high-quality recordings are ensured. Furthermore, most recognition applications involve controlled recording environments, in which the user turns the recognition event on and off and speaks cooperatively for the purpose of being recognized.
5834868725ff05a97b015515	Internet scam is fraudulent or intentionally misleading information posted on the web, usually with the intent of tricking people into sending money or disclosing sensitive information. We describe an application of logistic regression to detection of Internet scam. The developed system automatically collects 43 characteristic statistics about websites from 11 online sources and computes the probability that a given website is malicious. We present its empirical evaluation, which shows that its precision and recall are about 98%.
5834868625ff05a97b0126ad	This paper describes a path smoothing method that results in paths with clothoidal curvature and which includes a safety margin from obstacles. The method modifies grid based A* results, and tries to push the given path away from obstacles. A technique to take into account the initial direction of robot is also shown.
5834868725ff05a97b015654	Our work focuses on understanding the relationship among humans, agents, tasks, and the social situations in which they are engaged. From this, we seek to establish the elemental basis of social behavior and group phenomena, and make predictions about them. Our guide for this effort is the Model Social Agent matrix.
5834868625ff05a97b012898	In modern crowdsourcing markets, requesters face the challenge of training and managing large transient workforces. Requesters can hire peer workers to review others' work, but the value may be marginal, especially if the reviewers lack requisite knowledge. Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task domain by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion.
5834868625ff05a97b011d6f	This paper describes our research efforts aimed at understanding human being walking functions. Using motion capture system, force plates and distributed force sensors, both human being and humanoid H7 walk motion were captured. Experimental results are shown. Comparison in between human being with H7 walk in following points are discussed: 1) ZMP trajectories, 2) torso movement, 3) free leg trajectories, 4) joint angle usage, 5) joint torque usage. Furthermore, application to the humanoid robot is discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b011edf	Most automatic expression analysis systems attempt to recognize a small set of prototypic expressions (eg, happiness and anger). Such prototypic expressions, however, occur infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are communicated more often by changes in one or two discrete facial features. We develop an automatic system to analyze subtle changes in facial expressions based on both permanent (eg, mouth, eye, and brow) and transient (eg, furrows and wrinkles) facial features in a nearly frontal image sequence.
5834868625ff05a97b011f12	One goal of assistive robotics is to design interactive robots that can help disabled people with tasks such as fetching objects. When people do this task, they coordinate their movements closely with receivers. We investigated how a robot should fetch and give household objects to a person. To develop a model for the robot, we first studied trained dogs and person-to-person handoffs. Our findings suggest two models of handoff that differ in their predictability and adaptivity.

5834868625ff05a97b011310	In this paper, we address the issue of deciding when to stop active learning for building a labeled training corpus. Firstly, this paper presents a new stopping criterion, classification-change, which considers the potential ability of each unlabeled example on changing decision boundaries. Secondly, a multi-criteriabased combination strategy is proposed to solve the problem of predefining an appropriate threshold for each confidence-based stopping criterion, such as max-confidence, min-error, and overalluncertainty.
5834868625ff05a97b01132c	The detection of expressions of sentiment in online text has become a popular Natural Language Processing application. The task is commonly defined as identifying the words or phrases in a given fragment of text in which the reader understands that the author expresses some person's positive, negative, or perhaps neutral attitude toward a topic. These four elements—expression words, attitude holder, topic, and attitude value—have evolved with hardly any discussion in the literature about their foundation or nature.
5834868625ff05a97b012b60	Matrix and tensor completion techniques have proven useful in many applications such as recommender systems, image/video restoration, and web search. We explore the idea of using external information in completing missing values in tensors. In this work, we present a framework that employs side information as kernel matrices for tensor factorization. We apply our framework to problems of recommender systems and video restoration and show that our framework effectively deals with the cold-start problem.
5834868625ff05a97b012b7f	Injection vulnerabilities have topped rankings of the most critical web application vulnerabilities for several years [1, 2]. They can occur anywhere where user input may be erroneously executed as code. The injected input is typically aimed at gaining unauthorized access to the system or to private information within it, corrupting the system's data, or disturbing system availability. Injection vulnerabilities are tedious and difficult to prevent.
5834868625ff05a97b012d0c	Neural correlates of illusory contour perception have been found in both the early and the higher visual areas. But the locus and the mechanism for its computation remain elusive. Psychophysical evidence provided in this issue of Neuron shows that perceptual contour completion is likely done in the early visual cortex in a cascade manner using horizontal connections.
5834868625ff05a97b012d0e	This work investigated the roles of spontaneous synchronized rhythmic oscillations in information processing in a globally coupled neural network. We found that in the encoding of input aperiodic signals, there exists a range of optimal synchronous states in the network, where the information transmission rate and coding efficiency of the network are maximized. Our results indicate that it is not the weaker or stronger but an appropriate synchronous state may be of more functional significance in sensory encoding.
5834868625ff05a97b01200c	In Bayesian inference, the unknown parameter is given a prior distribution, and Bayes' theorem combines this with the likelihood from the observed data, to give the posterior distribution. The prior may be informative, subjective, or have a standard, reference form (usually representing vague knowledge). In hierarchical models, the prior distribution may have its own parameters that themselves have priors.

5834868625ff05a97b0113a6	Event Mention detection is the first step in textual event understanding. Proper evaluation is important for modern natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present our evaluation algorithm and results during the Event Mention Evaluation pilot study. We analyze the problems of evaluating multiple event mention attributes and discontinuous event mention spans. In addition, we identify a few limitations in the evaluation algorithm used for the pilot task and propose some potential improvements.
5834868725ff05a97b0157f7	To preserve multiple streams of independent information that converge onto a neuron, the information must be re-represented more efficiently in the neural response. Here we analyze the increase in the representational capacity of spike timing over rate codes using sound localization cues as an example.
5834868625ff05a97b0113c7	We describe our system developed at ISI for the Novelty track at TREC 2004. The system's two modules recognize relevant event and opinion sentences respectively. We focused mainly on recognizing relevant opinion sentences using various opinionbearing word lists. Of our 5 runs submitted for task 1, the best run provided an F-score of 0.390 (precision 0.30 and recall 0.71).
5834868725ff05a97b013d6b	Contention for critical sections can reduce performance and scalability by causing thread serialization. The proposed accelerated critical sections mechanism reduces this limitation. ACS executes critical sections on the high-performance core of an asymmetric chip multiprocessor (ACMP), which can execute them faster than the smaller cores can.
5834868625ff05a97b0113dd	Operating mobile phones while driving has been cited [4] as a factor in crashes that have led to 995 deaths and 24,000 injuries in the US alone during the year 2009. We propose context-aware extensions that reduce the need to use a mobile phone while driving. For example, when drivers are on their way to picking up somebody, their phones will automatically notify the person to be picked up that the driver is approaching, and will soon be at the pickup location.
5834868625ff05a97b012d9b	A computer-implemented method (400) to generate an avatar, such as an avatar forming part of synthetic user generated content. The method comprises determining a rigid model based on an appearance error, a shape error and a dimensionality (425) of received images (405), and an appearance component and shape component of the rigid model. The non-rigid digital model may be a person specific active appearance model. Other aspects of include a computer system (200) and software (225).
5834868625ff05a97b012c79	In this paper, we propose a long-term motion model for visual object tracking. In crowded street scenes, persistent occlusions are a frequent challenge for tracking algorithm and a robust, long-term motion model could help in these situations. Motivated by progresses in robot motion planning, we propose to construct a set ofplausible'plans for each person, which are composed of multiple long-term motion prediction hypotheses that do not include redundancies, unnecessary loops or collisions with other objects.
5834868725ff05a97b013d9d	The dissociation of non-histone proteins from chromatin by alkaline pH was studied using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A significant degree of selectivity of dissociation was observed. This selectivity may provide a new method for fractionating non-histone proteins.
5834868725ff05a97b013dd4	The binding and internalization of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated insulin by nonactivated and phytohemagglutinin-activated circulating human lymphocytes was measured by flow cytometry. In confirmation of previous results, negligible binding or internalization was observed for unstimulated cells, while activated lymphocytes showed significant insulin binding. The majority of this insulin was demonstrated to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and acidified within 60 min after addition of insulin.
5834868625ff05a97b012c8d	We describe a family of recently developed heuristicbased algorithms used for path planning in the real world. We discuss the fundamental similarities between static algorithms (eg A*), replanning algorithms (eg D*), anytime algorithms (eg ARA*), and anytime replanning algorithms (eg AD*). We introduce the motivation behind each class of algorithms, discuss their use on real robotic systems, and highlight their practical benefits and disadvantages.
5834868625ff05a97b012e15	Large scale outdoor robotic systems call for a supporting software environment during the phases of their development and operation. In this article we describe the support infrastructure designed for Project AURORA's robotic airship. This includes tools for pilot training, for design and test of control and navigation methods, for airship visualization, and for information sharing over the Internet.
5834868725ff05a97b013de5	We show that the basic semidefinite programming relaxation value of any constraint satisfaction problem can be computed in NC; that is, in parallel polylogarithmic time and polynomial work. As a complexity-theoretic consequence we get that MIP1 [k, c, s]⊆ PSPACE provided s/c≤(. 62− o (1)) k/2k, resolving a question of Austrin, Håstad, and Pass. Here MIP1 [k, c, s] is the class of languages decidable with completeness c and soundness s by an interactive proof system with k provers, each constrained to communicate just 1 bit.
5834868625ff05a97b012089	A system is described for acquiring multi-view video of a person moving through the environment. A real-time tracking algorithm adjusts the pan, tilt, zoom and focus parameters of multiple active cameras to keep the moving person centered in each view. The output of the system is a set of synchronized, time-stamped video streams, showing the person simultaneously from several viewpoints.
5834868625ff05a97b012e51	Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of microns. To achieve these tasks, surgeons use tools of diameter 0.9 mm or less to access the eye's interior structures. The level of force required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile threshold, requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback. However, both of these methods can lead to tissue damage.
5834868625ff05a97b012090	An effective data reduction technique based on vector quantization is introduced for nonparametric classifier design. Two new nonparametric classifiers are developed, and their performance is evaluated using various examples. The new methods maintain a classification accuracy that is competitive with that of classical methods but, at the same time, yields very high data reduction rates.
5834868625ff05a97b012091	This paper presents a framework for reasoning about the future motion of multiple objects in a road scene. Unlike previous approaches, we do not look for known dangerous configurations of objects, but rather we reason about the future paths of all objects in the scene, and assess their danger. Monte Carlo path planning is used to generate a probability distribution for the possible future motion of every car in the scene. This framework can be used to either control the car, or to display warnings for the driver.
5834868625ff05a97b012cb5	We analyze distributed optimization algorithms where parts of data and variables are distributed over several machines and synchronization occurs asynchronously. We prove convergence for the general case of a nonconvex objective plus a convex and possibly nonsmooth penalty. We demonstrate two challenging applications, l1-regularized logistic regression and reconstruction ICA, and present experiments on real datasets with billions of variables using both CPUs and GPUs.
5834868625ff05a97b012cb7	Although sleep and wake can be easily distinguished by using EEG, how to detect a drowsy state before subject falls asleep is of more importance in avoiding fatal consequences in accidents behind steering wheel caused by low level vigilance. Starting with the classical problem of difference between wake and sleep, we propose a method based on probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA) and succeed in detecting drowsiness distinguished from wake and sleep based on EEG.
5834868625ff05a97b0114b4	We examine the problems with automated recommendation systems when information about user preferences is limited. We equate the problem to one of content similarity measurement and apply techniques from Natural Language Processing to the domain of movie recommendation. We describe two algorithms, a naïve word-space approach and a more sophisticated approach using topic signatures, and evaluate their performance compared to baseline, gold standard, and commercial systems.
5834868625ff05a97b0114b6	We describe a model of virtual humans to be used in training for non-team interactions, such as negotiating with people from other organizations. The virtual humans build on existing task, dialogue, and emotion models, with an added model of trust, which are used to understand and produce interactional moves. The model has been implemented within an agent in the SASO-ST system, and some example dialogues are given, illustrating the necessity for building social bonds.
5834868625ff05a97b012cbf	In this paper we investigate the performance of different types of rectified activation functions in convolutional neural network: standard rectified linear unit (ReLU), leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU), parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) and a new randomized leaky rectified linear units (RReLU). We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task. Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results.
5834868625ff05a97b0114b7	In this paper, we address the issue of deciding when to stop active learning for building a labeled training corpus. Firstly, this paper presents a new stopping criterion, classification-change, which considers the potential ability of each unlabeled example on changing decision boundaries. Secondly, a multi-criteria-based combination strategy is proposed to solve the problem of predefining an appropriate threshold for each confidence-based stopping criterion, such as max-confidence, min-error, and overall-uncertainty.
5834868625ff05a97b0130b6	This paper describes an introductory robotics course where the Lego Mindstorms NXT kits are used as the robot platform. The aims, scope, and the contents of the course are presented and the design of the laboratory sessions is explained in detail. Finally, the term project of the course, for which the students were expected to design an autonomous robot to navigate in a maze to reach its goal and climb up a pole to complete the task, is elaborated from the students' point of view.
5834868625ff05a97b01167b	In the last few years, Facial Expression Synthesis (FES) has been a flourishing area of research driven by applications in character animation, computer games, and human computer interaction. This paper proposes a photo-realistic FES method based on Bilinear Kernel Reduced Rank Regression (BKRRR). BKRRR learns a high-dimensional mapping between the appearance of a neutral face and a variety of expressions (eg smile, surprise, squint). There are two main contributions in this paper:(1) Propose BKRRR for FES.
5834868725ff05a97b014085	Image segmentation is an essential step in many image analysis pipelines and many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. However, they are often evaluated subjectively or based on a small number of examples. To fill this gap, we hand-segmented a set of 97 fluorescence microscopy images (a total of 4009 cells) and objectively evaluated some previously proposed segmentation algorithms.
5834868625ff05a97b0130d5	RoboAKUT is a multi-agent rescue team developed at the Artificial Intelligence Lab of the Computer Engineering Department of Bogazici University. Our primary goal is to build a rescue team based on market paradigm and show that this method can be successfully implemented in highly dynamic, multi tasking and multi-robot environment. In addition to the general coordination issues we also work on multi-agent path planning which is not addressed by many of the teams.
5834868725ff05a97b013f7e	Over the last three years of using the Garnet system to create dozens of large-scale user interfaces, we have observed that the style of programming in Garnet is quite different from that in conventional objectoriented systems. In Garnet, programmers combine pre-defined objects into collections, use constraints to define the relationships among them, and then attach pre-defined “Interactor” objects to cause the objects to respond to input. The result is a declarative style of programming where the programmer rarely writes methods.
5834868725ff05a97b013e98	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868625ff05a97b012efe	Numerous tools have been proposed to help developers fix software errors and inefficiencies. Widely-used techniques such as memory checking suffer from overheads that limit their use to pre-deployment testing, while more advanced systems have such severe performance impacts that they may require special-purpose hardware. Previous works have described hardware that can accelerate individual analyses, but such specialization stymies adoption; generalized mechanisms are more likely to be added to commercial processors.
5834868625ff05a97b012f07	Today's languages, systems, and architectures include considerable support for generality and programmability. Systems are built to enable simple implementation of a broad class of programs, and to provide an acceptable level of performance and efficiency. The profusion of high-level languages, runtime and system support for tasks like garbage collection and virtualization, and architectural mechanisms like virtual memory speak to the importance placed by system designers on supporting programmability for a broad class of programs.

Threadsteading offers a glimpse at a future in which humans can engage in realtime, playful interaction with fabrication machines.
5834868625ff05a97b013084	We are investigating a subset of notification displays we refer to as ambient displays. Ambient displays are peripheral, aesthetically pleasing displays of information which support awareness of some data. Our work focuses on design guidelines and evaluation methodologies for developing successful ambient displays. We call a display successful when it is acceptable to users (they want it in their environment), and it changes their awareness of or behavior with respect to some information.

5834868625ff05a97b0131bb	Rapport has been identified as an important function of human interaction to increase task performances. In this paper we leverage existing literature and a corpus of peer tutoring data to develop a framework able to explain how humans in dyadic interactions build, maintain, and break rapport through the use of specific conversational strategies that function to fulfil specific social goals, and that are instantiated in particular verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
5834868625ff05a97b0131fb	In this paper, we present the results of our experimental effort in one form of impulsive manipulation: tapping. Our previous work studied the mechanics of tapping a planar object which then slides on a support surface, coming to rest due to friction. This work addresses the practical issues in creating a system which uses this mode of manipulation. We begin with the design of tapping devices-end effecters designed to deliver an impulse to an object, and report some of the issues we have found to be important in their design.
5834868725ff05a97b014256	We propose a new efficient automatic verification technique, Athena, for security protocol analysis. It uses a new efficient representation–our extension to the Strand Space Model, and utilizes techniques from both model checking and theorem proving approaches. Athena is fully automatic and is able to prove the correctness of many security protocols with arbitrary number of concurrent runs. The run time for a typical protocol from the literature, like the Needham–Schroeder protocol, is often a fraction of a second.
5834868725ff05a97b014258	We propose a primitive, called Pioneer, as a first step towards verifiable code execution on untrusted legacy hosts. Pioneer does not require any hardware support such as secure co-processors or CPU-architecture extensions. We implement Pioneer on an Intel Pentium IV Xeon processor. Pioneer can be used as a basic building block to build security systems. We demonstrate this by building a kernel rootkit detector.
5834868625ff05a97b01328f	When designing for or discussing privacy, it is critical to identify the conditions that create a system's or phenomenon's privacy implications. We present a set of interdependent dimensions that, when applied to the analysis of a privacy-related system or phenomenon, can expose the factors that determine the role of privacy therein. This can help focus the scope of discourse and the design of privacy in the HCI and ubiquitous computing communities.
5834868625ff05a97b013290	Although the accuracy and robustness of sketch recognizers have been steadily improving, there are still many issues involved in using them in applications. This paper details our experiences with using sketch recognizers from three different perspectives—end-users, user interface designers, and programmers—and describes some of the open research problems in each of these areas.
5834868725ff05a97b014321	How can we correlate the neural activity in the human brain as it responds to typed words, with properties of these terms (like 'edible','fits in hand')? In short, we want to find latent variables, that jointly explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. This is one of many settings of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem.
5834868725ff05a97b014362	Traditional connectionist models place an emphasis on learned weights. Based on neurobiological evidence, a new approach is developed and experimentally shown to be more robust for disambiguating novel combinations of stimuli. It does not require variable weights and avoids many training related issues. This approach is compared with traditional weight-learning methods. The network is better able to function in different scenarios and can recognize multiple stimuli even if it is only trained on single stimuli.
5834868625ff05a97b0133a9	Early, reliable detection of outbreaks of disease, whether natural (eg, West Nile virus) or bioterrorist-induced (eg, anthrax and smallpox), is a critical problem today. It is important to detect outbreaks early in order to provide the best possible medical response and treatment, as well as to improve the chances of identifying the source. A primary goal of this project is to develop new Bayesian models and inference algorithms that then are applied to monitor electronically available healthcare data to achieve early, reliable detection of outbreaks.
5834868625ff05a97b011712	Following the recent adoption by the machine translation community of automatic evaluation using the BLEU/NIST scoring process, we conduct an in-depth study of a similar idea for evaluating summaries. The results show that automatic evaluation using unigram co-occurrences between summary pairs correlates surprising well with human evaluations, based on various statistical metrics; while direct application of the BLEU evaluation procedure does not always give good results.
5834868725ff05a97b0146ef	Large real-world graph (aka network, relational) data are omnipresent, in online media, businesses, science, and the government. Analysis of these massive graphs is crucial, in order to extract descriptive and predictive knowledge with many commercial, medical, and environmental applications. In addition to its general structure, knowing what stands out, ie anomalous or novel, in the data is often at least, or even more important and interesting.
5834868625ff05a97b011a6a	We present acoustic barcodes, structured patterns of physical notches that, when swiped with eg, a fingernail, produce a complex sound that can be resolved to a binary ID. A single, inexpensive contact microphone attached to a surface or object is used to capture the waveform. We present our method for decoding sounds into IDs, which handles variations in swipe velocity and other factors. Acoustic barcodes could be used for information retrieval or to triggering interactive functions. They are passive, durable and inexpensive to produce.
5834868625ff05a97b0131aa	We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared translation task. We participated in two language pairs, German–English and Hindi–English. Our innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree transla-tion, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create “synthetic trans-lation options” that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the training data, and a method of combining the out-put of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.
5834868625ff05a97b0119f5	Partial evaluation is a program specialization technique that allows to optimize programs for which partial input is known. We show that partial evaluation can be used with advantage to speed up as well symbolic execution of programs. Interestingly, the input required for partial evaluation comes from symbolic execution itself which makes it natural to interleave partial evaluation and symbolic execution steps in a software verification setup.
5834868725ff05a97b015953	Non-reciprocated relationships, such as all workers knowing the president of the company but only a few of the workers being known by the president, and non-symmetric relationships, such as workers thinking that they know the president and thinking that the president does not know them, are endemic to most social situations. While such inconsistencies may be expected in relationships such as giving advice and lending money, they are rarely expected to occur in seemingly symmetric relationships such as friendship.
5834868625ff05a97b012301	Sim-U-Sketch is an experimental sketch-based interface we developed for Matlab®'s Simulink® software package. With this tool, users can construct functional Simulink models simply by drawing sketches on a computer screen. To support iterative design, Sim-U-Sketch allows users to interact with their sketches in real time to modify existing objects and add new ones. The system is equipped with a domain-independent, trainable symbol recognizer that can learn new symbols from single prototype examples.
5834868725ff05a97b014281	We contribute a novel approach to understand, dialogue, plan, and execute complex sentences to command a mobile service robot. We define a complex command as a natural language sentence consisting of sensing-based conditionals, conjunctions, and disjunctions. We introduce a flexible templatebased algorithm to extract such structure from the parse tree of the sentence. As the complexity of the command increases, extracting the right structure using the template-based algorithm decreases becomes more problematic.
5834868625ff05a97b011a4d	Background Latent HIV-1 reservoirs are identified as one of the major challenges to achieve HIV-1 cure. Currently available strategies are associated with wide variability in outcomes both in patients and CD4+ T cell models. This underlines the critical need to develop innovative strategies to predict and recognize ways that could result in better reactivation and eventual elimination of latent HIV-1 reservoirs.
5834868625ff05a97b012305	This paper describes a new approach to industrial styling design that combines the advantages of pen-based sketching with concepts from variational design to facilitate rapid and fluid development of 3D geometry. The approach is particularly useful for designing products that are primarily stylistic variations of existing ones. The input to the system is a 2D concept sketch of the object, and a generic 3D wireframe template. In the first step, the underlying template is aligned with the input sketch using a camera calibration algorithm.
5834868725ff05a97b014299	Limited memory bandwidth and long access latency are serious GPU performance bottlenecks. For emerging applications that are inherently error resilient, this paper proposes to predict the values of safe-to-approximate loads and drop a certain fraction of the cache misses with predicted values to improve performance and energy efficiency.
5834868725ff05a97b0147a7	The multiple gamma function Γ n, defined by a recurrence-functional equation as a generalization of the Euler gamma function, was originally introduced by Kinkelin, Glaisher, and Barnes around 1900. Today, due to the pioneer work of Conrey, Katz and Sarnak, interest in the multiple gamma function has been revived. This paper discusses some theoretical aspects of the Γ n function and their applications to summation of series and infinite products.
5834868725ff05a97b0147a9	This result is shocking because it can be used to generate the nth base-16 digit of 7r without having to look at any prior digits. And, so long as n is less than a billion or so, the entire computation can be carried out with 16-digit numbers. This is a radical idea, since all previous algorithms for the nth digit of 7r required the computation of all previous digits, and the use of d-digit arithmetic in the computation. For more details of the fairly easy argument that leads from the BBP formula to an algorithm for far-out hex digits of 7r see [1] or [2].
5834868625ff05a97b010fad	This paper discusses a need to provide adaptive navigation support for students accessing large numbers of interactive examples in Web-enhanced education. We introduce the system NavEx that is able to provide adaptive annotation of programming examples without any need of manual indexing. NavEx uses innovative algorithms for prerequisite/outcome indexing of learning material and an efficient knowledge-based approach for adaptive annotation.
5834868725ff05a97b0147e8	Many applications involve repeatedly computing the optimal, maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration of a graphical model as the model changes, often slowly or incrementally over time, eg, due to input from a user. Small changes to the model often require updating only a small fraction of the MAP configuration, suggesting the possibility of performing updates faster than recomputing from scratch. In this paper we present an algorithm for efficiently performing such updates under arbitrary changes to the model.
5834868625ff05a97b011b09	A camera system has a neural network for calibration of image distortion. The neural network learns the conversion from image coordinates with distortion to image coordinates with substantially reduced distortion, whereby the neural network provides image coordinates having substantially reduced distortion. In a learning process of the neural network, a relatively simple camera model is used to provide an instruction signal to the neural network according to sample data provided from the real camera.
5834868625ff05a97b010fd0	Fast similarity search is one of the key techniques in many large scale learning and data mining applications. Recently, hashing-based methods, which create compact and efficient codes that preserve data distribution, have received considerable attention due to their promising theoretical and empirical results. An ideal hashing method 1) can naturally have out-of-sample extension; 2) has very low computational complexity; and 3) has significant improvement over linear search in the original space in terms of accuracy.
5834868625ff05a97b013407	We present a framework that couples the syntax and semantics of natural language sentences in a generative model, in order to develop a semantic parser that jointly infers the syntactic, morphological, and semantic representations of a given sentence under the guidance of background knowledge. To generate a sentence in our framework, a semantic statement is first sampled from a prior, such as from a set of beliefs in a knowledge base. Given this semantic statement, a grammar probabilistically generates the output sentence.
5834868725ff05a97b01482f	In this document, we describe our submission for the 2011 10GB JouleSort competition. Our system consists of a machine with a low-power desktop processor and seven flash drives, sorting the 10GB dataset in 15.55 seconds (소 0.03 s) seconds with an average power of 92.0 W (소 0.57 W). This system sorts the 10GB dataset using only 1430 Joules (소 9.9 J), providing 69944 (소 489) sorted records per Joule. This improves energy used by 36% and sorted records per Joule by 56% when compared to the winning 2010 Daytona/Indy entry.
5834868725ff05a97b014893	In this paper we present a novel data structure for sparse vectors based on Cuckoo hashing. It is highly memory efficient and allows for random access at near dense vector level rates. This allows us to solve sparse l 1 programming problems exactly and without preprocessing at a cost that is identical to dense linear algebra both in terms of memory and speed. Our approach provides a feasible alternative to the hash kernel and it excels whenever exact solutions are required, such as for feature selection.
5834868725ff05a97b0148bb	Understanding a user's motivations provides valuable information beyond the ability to recommend items. Quite often this can be accomplished by perusing both ratings and review texts. Unfortunately matrix factorization approaches to recommendation result in large, complex models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we attack this problem through succinct additive co-clustering on both ratings and reviews. Our model yields accurate and interpretable recommendations.
5834868625ff05a97b011a56	P out of another geometric shape, Q has been extensively studied in recent years. A number of variations of this problem has been addressed including P being convex or concave, cuts being line cut or ray cut, Q being a polygon or a circle etc. In this paper we give a simple linear time O (log n)-approximation algorithm for the problem where Q is a circle and n is the number of vertices of the convex polygon P. We also give a constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem which runs in O (n3) time.
5834868725ff05a97b01595c	It is proposed that the decision making process is intrinsically formulative in nature; ie, for the individual the crux of the process is in the development of a frame, a knowledge base, that can be used to make the decision, rather than the evaluation of the alternatives' per se'. A two stage model of decision making is forwarded. In the first stage the individual develops his frame. This is the critical, formulative, stage and dependent on the socio‐cultural environment. In the second stage the individual makes a decision by evaluating his frame.
5834868625ff05a97b012fbe	Individuals could drastically reduce their carbon footprint by changing daily behaviors to more sustainable practices. In order for this change to occur, individuals must be made aware of their impact and must be provided with an incentive to change their consumption patterns. In this paper we provide a literature review of the current research in the areas of energy feedback, social psychology, and social visualization to determine functionality that is important in a computer-based feedback system to motivate users.
5834868625ff05a97b011aaf	Many interactive surfaces have the ability to detect the shape of hands or objects placed on them. However, shape information is typically either condensed to individual contact points or categorized as discrete gestures. This does not leverage the full expressiveness of touch input, thus limits the actions users can perform in interactive applications. We present ShapeTouch, an exploration of interactions that directly utilize the contact shape on interactive surfaces to manipulations of objects and interactors.
5834868625ff05a97b012fc5	The proposed paper describes recent work on robots that manipulate paper on a desktop. So far we have built three. The proposed paper would outline the goals of our work on desktop robotics, describe the design of the three robots built so far, present experimental data on the performance of one of them, and outline some of the issues for future work.
5834868625ff05a97b011114	Rapport has been identified as an important function of human interaction to increase task performances. In this paper we leverage existing literature and a corpus of peer tutoring data to develop a framework able to explain how humans in dyadic interactions build, maintain, and break rapport through the use of specific conversational strategies that function to fulfil specific social goals, and that are instantiated in particular verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
5834868725ff05a97b014cb7	In this paper we present our argument that context information could be used in early stages ie, during the definition of mapping of the words into sequence of graphemes. We show that the early tagged contextual graphemes play a significant role in improving the performance of grapheme based speech synthesis and speech recognition systems.
5834868625ff05a97b011e9d	A content-based 3D neuroradiologic image retrieval system is being developed at the Robotics Institute of CMU. The special characteristics of this system include: directly dealing with multimodal 3D images (MR/CT); image similarity based on anatomical structures of the human brain; and combining both visual and collateral information for indexing and retrieval. A testbed has been implemented for using detected salient visual features for indexing and retrieving 3D images.
5834868725ff05a97b014cd5	The SOLE conecept-to-speech system uses linguistic information provided by an NLG component to improve the intonation of synthetic speech. As the text is generated, the system automatically annotates the text with linguistic information using a set of XML tags which we have developed for this purpose. The annotation is then used by the synthesis component in producing the intonation. We describe the annotation system and discuss our choice of linguistic constructs to annotate.
5834868725ff05a97b014cd7	This paper introduces a new optimization technique for moving segment labels (phone and subphonetic) to optimize statistical parametric speech synthesis models. The choice of objective measures is investigated thoroughly and listening tests show the results to significantly improve the quality of the generated speech equivalent to increasing the database size by 3 fold.
5834868625ff05a97b01139f	We present a preliminary study on unsu-pervised preposition sense disambiguation (PSD), comparing different models and training techniques (EM, MAP-EM with L 0 norm, Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at un-supervised preposition sense disambiguation. Our best accuracy reaches 56%, a significant improvement (at p<. 001) of 16% over the most-frequent-sense baseline.
5834868625ff05a97b01238b	Methods and arrangements for segmenting log records. A log file is received. Candidates for a sequential pattern within the log file are automatically discerned, and, for each candidate, a likelihood is estimated that it represents a boundary within the log file. Other variants and embodiments are broadly contemplated herein.
5834868725ff05a97b015967	Task dependencies drive the need to coordinate work activities. We describe a technique for using automatically generated archi-val data to compute coordination requirements, ie, who must coordinate with whom to get the work done. Analysis of data from a large software development project revealed that coordina-tion requirements were highly volatile, and frequently extended beyond team boundaries. Congruence between coordination re-quirements and coordination activities shortened development time.

5834868625ff05a97b011b2a	The complete set of measurements that could ever be used by a passive 3D vision algorithm is the plenoptic function or light-field. We give a concise characterization of when the light-field of a Lambertian scene uniquely determines its shape and, conversely, when the shape is inherently ambiguous. In particular, we show that stereo computed from the light-field is ambiguous if and only if the scene is radiating light of a constant intensity (and color, etc) over an extended region.
5834868725ff05a97b0143b0	Natural language provides a flexible, intuitive way for people to command robots, which is becoming increasingly important as robots transition to working alongside people in our homes and workplaces. To follow instructions in unknown environments, robots will be expected to reason about parts of the environments that were described in the instruction, but that the robot has no direct knowledge about. However, most existing approaches to natural language understanding require that the robot's environment be known a priori.
5834868725ff05a97b013e90	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868725ff05a97b015244	The PileSort module in* ORA allows a user to load a series of entities such as concepts or people's names. These entities are displayed in a deck, which can then be organized and grouped into a pile, which will contain entities that are similar to one another. The output of the PileSort module will be a network in DyNetML format. This report overviews the PileSort module, its interface, and an example usage of the PileSort module along with analysis of results using* ORA.
5834868625ff05a97b0122ab	The problem of estimating a covariance matrix in small samples has been considered by several authors following early work by Stein. This problem can be especially important in hierarchical models where the standard errors of fixed and random effects depend on estimation of the covariance matrix of the distribution of the random effects. We propose a set of hierarchical priors (HPs) for the covariance matrix that produce posterior shrinkage toward a specified structure—here we examine shrinkage toward diagonality.
5834868525ff05a97b010e6e	CiteULike (www. citeulike. org) is a social Web site designed for scholars to store, organize and share the papers that they are reading. CiteULike papers are organized around individual CiteULike users, of which there is a private library to store all the papers the users have read, the tags that the users have entered, and the virtual communities (called groups) that the users have subscribed to. However, as an open free access environment, CiteULike suffers from spam contamination, unintentional human errors and inaccurate information.
5834868625ff05a97b011a07	In human–human communication we use verbal, vocal and non-verbal signals to communicate with others. Facial expressions are a form of non-verbal communication, recognizing them helps to improve the human–machine interaction. This paper proposes an approach for recognizing the facial expressions using camera images. The proposed system tracks the human face using high-speed cameras, extracts the pose-normalized image and it is able to learn a dynamic model of the facial expressions.
5834868725ff05a97b0146a0	The rise of the multicore era is catapulting concurrency into mainstream programming. Current programming paradigms build in sequentiality, and as a result, concurrency support in those languages forces programmers into low-level reasoning about execution order. In this paper, we introduce a new programming paradigm in which concurrency is the default. Our Aeminium language uses access permissions to express logical dependencies in the code at a higher level of abstraction than sequential order.
5834868725ff05a97b0144a0	This paper describes a study in which student-created diagrams about arguments in an ill-defined domain were manually graded by two independent human graders. Findings include that the graders overall agreed with each other on their grades, but their agreement was lower than one would expect in well-defined domains, and higher for solutions of extreme quality.
5834868725ff05a97b013f8b	Marquise is a new interactive tool that allows virtually all of the user interfaces of graphical editors to be created by demonstration without programming. A “graphical editor” allows the user to create and manipulate graphical objects with a mouse. This is a very large class of programs and includes drawing programs like MacDraw, graph layout editors like MacProject, visual language editors, and many CAD/CAM programs. The primary innovation in Marquise is to allow the designer to demonstrate the overall behavior of the interface.
5834868725ff05a97b0144fb	Multiple External Representations (MERs) have been used successfully in instructional activities, including fractions. However, students often have difficulties making the connections between the MERs spontaneously. We argue that interactive fraction representations may help students in discovering relevant features and relating the MERs to one another. Support for guiding student interaction is provided by example-tracing tutors.
5834868725ff05a97b013ffd	DRAM systems achieve high performance when all DRAM banks are busy servicing useful memory requests. The degree to which DRAM banks are busy is called DRAM Bank-Level Parallelism (BLP). This paper proposes two new cost-effective mechanisms to maximize DRAM BLP. BLP-Aware Prefetch Issue (BAPI) issues prefetches into the on-chip Miss Status Holding Registers (MSHRs) associated with each core in a multi-core system such that the requests can be serviced in parallel in different DRAM banks.
5834868725ff05a97b014d05	We examine some ways in which contemporary results from neural network theory can potentially contribute to a Buddhist understanding of emptiness. We also make some general remarks about the pitfalls and benefits inherent in attempting to apply ideas from artificial intelligence to an understanding of Buddhism.
5834868725ff05a97b013877	Robot Obstacle Avoidance [2]: Nowadays, robots interact frequently with a dynamic environment outside limited manufacturing sites and in close proximity with humans. Thus, safety of motion and obstacle avoidance are vital safety features of such robots. We formally verify that our controller avoids both stationary and moving obstacles.
5834868625ff05a97b011f1a	For the average person, the Internet is still too hard to use. We report evidence from HomeNet, a field trial in Pittsburgh that tries to understand how people use the Internet. Despite our reducing technological and economic barriers to use, families had problems connecting and using the Internet. We show that help calls, however, are not a good indicator of usability, since it is the “enthusiasts” and people with instrumental tasks to accomplish who call.
5834868625ff05a97b0120f1	Motivation: Many complex disease syndromes such as asthma consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes, raising a new technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. Although a causal genetic variation may influence a group of highly correlated traits jointly, most of the previous association analyses considered each phenotype separately, or combined results from a set of single-phenotype analyses.
5834868625ff05a97b012d44	One goal of assistive robotics is to design interactive robots that can help disabled people with tasks such as fetching objects. When people do this task, they coordinate their movements closely with receivers. We investigated how a robot should fetch and give household objects to a person. To develop a model for the robot, we first studied trained dogs and person-to-person handoffs. Our findings suggest two models of handoff that differ in their predictability and adaptivity.
5834868625ff05a97b011742	Prior laboratory studies have shown that PhishGuru, an embedded training system, is an effective way to teach users to identify phishing scams. PhishGuru users are sent simulated phishing attacks and trained after they fall for the attacks. In this current study, we extend the PhishGuru methodology to train users about spear phishing and test it in a real world setting with employees of a Portuguese company. Our results demonstrate that the findings of PhishGuru laboratory studies do indeed hold up in a real world deployment.
5834868725ff05a97b01454b	Ownership domain annotations enable obtaining at compile-time the system's execution structure from the annotated program. The execution structure is sound, hierarchical (and thus more scalable) and conveys more design intent than flat object graphs obtained by existing static analyses that do not rely on annotations.
5834868725ff05a97b01539b	We describe a system for scheduling a conference based on incomplete information about available resources and scheduling constraints. We explain the representation of uncertain knowledge and related common-sense rules, which allow reasoning based on uncertain and partially missing data.
5834868625ff05a97b0129e6	For several years we have been conducting Accuracy Based Evaluations (ABE) of the JANUS speech-to-speech MT system (Gates et al., 1997) which measure quality and fidelity of translation. Recently we have begun to design a Task Based Evaluation for JANUS (Thomas, 1999) which measures goal completion. This paper describes what we have learned by comparing the two types of evaluation. Both evaluations (ABE and TBE) were conducted on a common set of user studies in the semantic domain of travel planning.
5834868725ff05a97b0147f0	In self-adjusting computation, programs respond automatically and efficiently to modifications to their data by tracking the dynamic data dependences of the computation and incrementally updating the output as needed. In this tutorial, we describe the self-adjusting-computation model and present the language Δ ML (Delta ML) for writing self-adjusting programs.
5834868725ff05a97b015a25	We extend the Burch and Dill flushing technique [6] for formal verification of microprocessors to be applicable to designs where the functional units and memories have multicycle and possibly arbitrary latency. We also show ways to incorporate exceptions and branch prediction by exploiting the properties of the logic of Positive Equality with Uninterpreted Functions [4][5]. We study the modeling of the above features in different versions of dual-issue superscalar processors.
5834868625ff05a97b012480	Abstract—Content creation is a large component of the cost of creating educational software. Estimates are that approximately 200 hours of development time are required for every hour of instruction. We present an authoring tool designed to reduce this cost as it helps to refine and maintain content. The ASSISTment Builder is a tool designed to effectively create, edit, test, and deploy tutor content. The web-based interface simplifies the process of tutor construction to allow users with little or no programming experience to develop content.
5834868625ff05a97b0117ce	The invention discloses an Ultrafast Electro-Dynamic X, Y and Theta Positioning Stage. A positioning stage made according to this invention allows light payloads to be moved with extremely high linear and angular accelerations over finite distances and angles with a plane. An important feature of this invention is a momentum-cancelling design which allows reaction forces and torques on the fixed member to approach zero, thereby, allowing for a smooth and an ultrafast performance by the positioning stage.
5834868725ff05a97b01429a	Data compression can be an effective method to achieve higher system performance and energy efficiency in modern data-intensive applications by exploiting redundancy and data similarity. Prior works have studied a variety of data compression techniques to improve both capacity (eg, of caches and main memory) and bandwidth utilization (eg, of the on-chip and off-chip interconnects). In this paper, we make a new observation about the energy-efficiency of communication when compression is applied.
5834868625ff05a97b01210d	We present the design of the Snackbot, a robot that will deliver snacks in our university buildings. The robot is intended to provide a useful, continuing service and to serve as a research platform for long-term Human-Robot Interaction. Our design process, which occurred over 24 months, is documented as a contribution for others in HRI who may be developing social robots that offer services. We describe the phases of the design project, and the design decisions and tradeoffs that led to the current version of the robot.
5834868625ff05a97b011149	Fashion and beauty videos, particularly haul videos-those that summarize a recent shopping trip-have quickly grown into a YouTube phenomenon. Creators share the fashion and beauty products they buy and detail how they use them to create a look. Today, over 50 million people devote more than 1.6 billion minutes watching these videos. Despite the size of this online practice, little research exists investigating how this new content fits within the world of fashion media.
5834868625ff05a97b011a6d	Electronic commerce has enabled a number of online pay-for-answer services. However, despite commercial interest, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how financial incentives support question asking and answering. Using 800 questions randomly selected from a pay-for-answer site, along with site usage statistics, we examined what factors impact askers' decisions to pay. We also explored how financial rewards affect answers, and if question pricing can help organize Q&A exchanges for archival purposes.
5834868625ff05a97b0132e3	Software lifeguards, or tools that monitor applications at runtime, are an effective way of identifying program errors and security exploits. Parallel programs are susceptible to a wider range of possible errors than sequential programs, making them even more in need of online monitoring. Unfortunately, monitoring parallel applications is difficult due to inter-thread data dependences. In prior work, we introduced a new software framework for online parallel program monitoring inspired by dataflow analysis, called Butterfly Analysis.
5834868725ff05a97b014400	In this work an online handwritten text recognition system for Turkish has been developed using a Tablet PC as an interface. In recent years, although there has been great developments in the Tablet PC technology, still there are no applications for recognition in Turkish language. In this work, we have developed a prototype system using Hidden Markov Models which recognizes handwritten words from a small vocabulary list. This system has achieved a recognition rate over% 90 percent.
5834868725ff05a97b0153cb	In this paper, we describe our system for the TAC KBP 2015 Event track. We focus in particular on development of multilingual event extraction through the combination of language-dependent and languageindependent features. Our system specifically handles texts in both English and Chinese, but is designed in a manner to be extendable to new languages. Our experiments on the ACE2005 corpus show promising results for future development.
5834868625ff05a97b012118	Robotic assistants soon will serve many assistive roles in our everyday lives. It is important to understand how these robots can interact with users, not just as tools, but also as social agents. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we examined cooperation in an effortful task with a robot that displayed one of two personalities. We found that a serious, caring robot induced more compliance than a playful, ejoybale robot on this task. We propose possible explanations and further research.
5834868725ff05a97b013b37	We present a novel system for performing information management in a unified manner. Users currently must manage large amounts of data which may be fragmented across file formats and applications. Our system, called Iolite, attempts to consolidate this information by automatically discovering associations within the data. Iolite uses these associations to provide a unified interface to navigate and operate on this information space.
5834868725ff05a97b013b5f	Designing useful tools for developers requires identifying and understanding an important problem developers face and designing a solution that addresses this problem. This paper describes a design process that uses data to understand problems, design solutions, and evaluate solutions' usefulness.
5834868625ff05a97b0118cb	Constraints offer the ability to describe, in a high-level and declarative fashion, a set of relationships that are to hold among data items. Given a set of values and a set of relationships between them expressed as equations, a constraint maintenance or evaluation system can be employed to automatically maintain the proper relationships between these values in the face of changes. The automatic nature of this update allows very high level specifications to be employed for a number of tasks in the user interface software domain.
5834868625ff05a97b013526	We present the SimSensei system, a fully automatic virtual agent that conducts interviews to assess indicators of psychological distress. We emphasize on the perception part of the system, a multimodal framework which captures and analyzes user state for both behavioral understanding and interactional purposes.
5834868625ff05a97b011c89	Using known camera motion to estimate depth from image sequences is an important problem in robot vision. Many applications of depth from motion, including navigation and manipulation, require algorithms that can estimate depth in an on-line, incremental fashion. This requires a representation that records the uncertainty in depth estimates and a mechanism that integrates new measurements with existing depth estimates to reduce the uncertainty over time Kalman filtering provides this mechanism.
5834868625ff05a97b013534	This article briefly explores potential synergies between the fields of virtual human and human-robot interaction research. We consider challenges in advancing the effectiveness of human-robot teams makes recommendations for enhancing this by facilitating synergies between robotics and virtual human research.
5834868625ff05a97b01353a	In this paper, we explore a multimodal approach to sensing affective state during exposure to visual narratives. Using four different modalities, consisting of visual facial behaviors, thermal imaging, heart rate measurements, and verbal descriptions, we show that we can effectively predict changes in human affect. Our experiments show that these modalities complement each other, and illustrate the role played by each of the four modalities in detecting human affect.
5834868725ff05a97b0153de	The perspective that responses are elicited by stimuli to which they have become associated or learned because they are reinforced remains strongly entrenched in psychological thought. Just what reinforcers are and how they operate, perhaps as agents that bond responses to stimuli, are unresolved issues. The most generally accepted definition of a reinforcer is that it is an event that increases the probability that a response will reoccur if it is reinforced. But that definition is circular and does not explain how reinforcement works.

5834868625ff05a97b01278e	We report serious bugs in floating-point computations for evaluating elementary functions in the Embedded GNU C Library. For instance, the sine function can return values larger than 1053 in certain rounding modes. Further investigation also exposed faulty implementations in the most recent version of the library, which seemingly fixed some bugs, but only by discarding user-specified rounding-mode requirements.
5834868725ff05a97b0144d3	While the evidence in support of guided exploratory learning over pure exploratory learning seems clear, what is lacking is a set of guidelines that specify precisely how much guidance is ideal. In this paper we describe a small pilot study in which we contrast two forms of guidance. In particular, students in one condition use a simulation environment in a highly directed manner (lead by a script) whereas students in another condition use the same simulation environment in a more exploratory manner (supported by a human tutor).
5834868725ff05a97b0153e8	We consider the task of scheduling a conference based on incomplete information about resources and constraints, and describe a mechanism for the dynamic learning of related default assumptions, which enable the scheduling system to make reasonable guesses about missing data. We outline the representation of incomplete knowledge, describe the learning procedure, and demonstrate that the learned knowledge improves the scheduling results.
5834868625ff05a97b013443	The primary motivation for this study of Japanese companies was to understand three basic aspects of their design process: a) organization of the current process, b) expectations and approaches for changes to the process, and c) role of research in enhancing industrial practice. Given these objectives, we collected data using a questionnaire and an on site interview with company personnel. The questionnaire was sent in advance of our trip to allow the companies to prepare written and verbal accounts in answering the questions.
5834868725ff05a97b014354	This report contains supporting evidence for claims put forth and explained in the paper “Statically Typed String Sanitation Inside a Python”[1], including proofs of lemmas and theorems asserted in the paper, examples, additional discussion of the paper's technical content, and errata.
5834868625ff05a97b012554	Beanstalk is an educational game for children ages 6-10 teaching balance-fulcrum principles while folding in scientific inquiry and socio-emotional learning. This paper explores the incorporation of these additional dimensions using intrinsic motivation and a framing narrative. Four versions of the game are detailed, along with preliminary player data in a 2× 2 pilot test with 64 children shaping the modifications of Beanstalk for much broader testing.
5834868625ff05a97b013213	Origami, the human art of paper sculpture, is a fresh challenge for the field of robotic manipulation, and provides a concrete example for many difficult and general manipulation problems. This paper presents some initial results, including the world's first origami-folding robot, definition of a simple class of origami for which we have designed a complete automatic planner, an analysis of the kinematics of more complicated folds, and some new theorems about foldability.
5834868725ff05a97b01435b	Injection vulnerabilities have topped rankings of the most critical web application vulnerabilities for several years [1, 2]. They can occur anywhere where user input may be erroneously executed as code. The injected input is typically aimed at gaining unauthorized access to the system or to private information within it, corrupting the system's data, or disturbing system availability. Injection vulnerabilities are tedious and difficult to prevent.
5834868725ff05a97b015007	Spoken dialog systems typically use a limited number of non-understanding recovery strategies and simple heuristic policies to engage them (eg first ask user to repeat, then give help, then transfer to an operator). We propose a supervised, online method for learning a non-understanding recovery policy over a large set of recovery strategies. The approach consists of two steps: first, we construct runtime estimates for the likelihood of success of each recovery strategy, and then we use these estimates to construct a policy.
5834868625ff05a97b0117ab	This work examines force modeling and software-based commutation for closed-loop control of planar linear motors, motivated by the need for a robust and versatile planar robot for precision assembly. The approach taken is to make measurements of the static and dynamic force capabilities of the motor as directly as possible, and determine the applicability of simple models commonly used. Measurements of force ripple, linearity with current, force reduction with skew angle, and eddy current damping forces are presented.
5834868625ff05a97b0117ac	A mobile robot having a height-to-width ratio approximating a normal adult human balances and maneuvers atop a single, spherical wheel. Dynamic balancing techniques incorporating fiber-optic gyroscopes and micro-electromechanical accelerometers measure a number of parameters which, along with data from motor shaft encoders, enable a computer to calculate the forces needed to be applied to the spherical wheel to maintain the robot upright as it maneuvers or remains in place.
5834868725ff05a97b015018	The paper presents a framework for building multilingual text-to-speech systems. It addresses the issue at three levels. First it discusses the necessary steps required to build a synthetic voice from scratch in a new language. The second concerns the building of a new voice without recording any new acoustic data, and the restrictions that imposes. The third more speculative part discusses the steps that would be necessary to allow high quality synthesis of new languages by recording only minimal amounts in that language.
5834868725ff05a97b015019	Last year the Blizzard Challenge 2005 introduced the speech synthesis community to the concept of large scale, multi-site evaluation of TTS systems using common data. In this, the second year of the Blizzard Challenge, we again tackled this task. Participation increased dramatically, out of a total of 17 initial sites that showed interest, a total of 14 sites from around the world actually submitted entries. In this paper we discuss the results, difficulties, and differences in this year's Challenge.
5834868725ff05a97b015031	Outlier removal is a straightforward technique for improving the quality of unit selection catalogs without hand correction. This paper investigates the use of phone durations as a criteria for removing bad units. Scoring conditioned on linguistic context demonstrably better than statistics based on phone class alone. The impact of voice modification is evaluated with a 444K utterance test corpus.
5834868625ff05a97b0133f7	OBJECTIVE This paper describes the evolution of a biosurveillance system that incorporates user feedback to improve system utility and usability. The system monitors national-level over-the-counter (OTC) pharmacy sales on a daily basis. We use fast spatiotemporal scan statistics to detect disease outbreaks.
5834868725ff05a97b0144df	We describe a study of naturalistic teacher guidance for an exploratory learning activity called Invention. Our study illustrates a specific pedagogical style, whereby the teacher offers little feedback and few explanations, but largely poses questions, to help students identify and remedy their own errors. These findings have informed the design of a computerized Invention Coach and may apply more broadly to other exploratory learning environments.
5834868625ff05a97b0118f5	This paper reportsl on the development of a nose-machine interface device that provides real-time gesture, position, smell and facial expression information. The DATA NOSETM2—Data AtomaTa CORNUCOPIA pNeumatic Olfactory I/O-deviSE Tactile Manipulation [Olsen86, Myers91]—allows novice users without any formal nose training to perform complex interactive tasks.
5834868625ff05a97b0118f7	The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools, from hammers to tweezers. However, despite this remarkable dexterity, gestures on today's touch devices are simplistic, relying primarily on the chording of fingers: one-finger pan, two-finger pinch, four-finger swipe and similar. We propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical tools from the real world. In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction.
5834868725ff05a97b013c4e	FCS 3.1 has undergone an extensive revision process including several months of the ISAC wide-membership commentary period and final approval by the ISAC Data Standards Task Force.

5834868625ff05a97b011710	This paper consists of three parts: a preliminary typology of summaries in general; a description of the current and planned modules and performance of the SUMMARIST automated multilingual text summarization system being built sat ISI, and a discussion of three methods to evaluate summaries.
5834868725ff05a97b015948	ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization's design structure. The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resource, and task entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. ORA contains over 50 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect.
5834868725ff05a97b015438	In the creation of synthetic computer characters, the creators shouldn't have to create or control every move of their life like human agents: for example, during the progress of a search or planning system, responding to knowledge based queries, or portraying autonomous agents during real-time virtual environment simulations. For these automated characters we must generate behavior on the basis of rules abstracted from the study of human behavior.
5834868625ff05a97b011019	This letter provides an overview of our recent work studying the impacts of price competition and congestion in the cloud marketplace. Specifically, we discuss a three-tier market model that studies a vertical marketplace where users purchase services from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, which in turn purchase computing resources from either Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers.
5834868625ff05a97b012146	A robot's appearance and behavior provide cues to the robot's abilities and propensities. We hypothesize that an appropriate match between a robot's social cues and its task improve the people's acceptance of and cooperation with the robot. In an experiment, people systematically preferred robots for jobs when the robot's humanlikeness matched the sociability required in those jobs. In two other experiments, people complied more with a robot whose demeanor matched the seriousness of the task.

5834868725ff05a97b0158ae	The GIVE Challenge is a recent shared task in which NLG systems are evaluated over the Internet. In this paper, we validate this novel NLG evaluation methodology by comparing the Internet-based results with results we collected in a lab experiment. We find that the results delivered by both methods are consistent, but the Internet-based approach offers the statistical power necessary for more fine-grained evaluations and is cheaper to carry out.
5834868725ff05a97b014155	Section 2 described mechanisms for accumulating measurements of software state. In this section, we treat the issue of conveying these measurement chains to an external entity in an authentic manner. We refer to this process as attestation, though some works use the phrase outbound authentication. We also discuss privacy concerns and mitigation strategies that arise when sharing this information with third parties.
5834868625ff05a97b01321e	This paper explores a method of manipulating a planar rigid body on a conveyor belt using a robot with just one joint. This approach has the potential of offering a simple and flexible method for feeding parts in industrial automation applications. In this paper we outline our approach, develop some of the theoretical properties, present a planner for the robot, and describe an initial implementation.
5834868725ff05a97b0145df	We propose an automated method to recover the full calibration parameters between a 3D range sensor and a monocular camera system. Our method is not only accurate and fully automated, but also relies on a simple calibration target consisting of a single circle. This allows the algorithm to be suitable for applications requiring in-situ calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a camera-lidar system and show results on 3D mapping tasks.
5834868625ff05a97b0119a7	Social media is rapidly becoming one of the mediums of choice for understanding the cultural pulse of a region; eg, for identifying what the population is concerned with and what kind of help is needed in a crisis. To assess this cultural pulse it is critical to have an accurate assessment of who is saying what in social media. However, social media is also the home of malicious users engaged in disruptive, disingenuous, and potentially illegal activity. A range of users, both human and non-human, carry out such social cyber-attacks.
5834868725ff05a97b014170	We propose a demonstration of SCION, a future Internet Architecture designed for the 21st century. We demonstrate SCION's various rich features (including DDoS defense, native multipath communication, high-speed anonymous routing) and its ease of deployment.

5834868725ff05a97b0141cd	We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous channels by leveraging next-generation network architectures. HORNET is designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network layer thus enabling a wide range of applications. Our system uses only symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state on intermediate routers. This design enables HORNET routers implemented on off-the-shelf hardware to process anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s.
5834868625ff05a97b012fa4	For the entity linking task, a three-step entity linking system is developed. Similar to some systems in KBP 2010, a list of possible candidates are first selected. Then the best candidate is identified to decide whether a link exists. In addition, a document clustering algorithm is used to group NIL queries. This system incorporates Wikipedia linking information and other textual and contextual features. Our system produces a high answer coverage and accurate linking result. However, the NIL detection system brings significant loss in the final F-score.
5834868625ff05a97b01254a	Several models were built recently in the metacognitive level of the students' interaction with Cognitive Tutors, an intelligent tutoring system based on ACT-R theory. After finding suboptimal help-seeking behavior, we built a metacognitive model of desired help-seeking behavior (Aleven et al. in press). In a different Cognitive Tutor, Baker et al.(2004) built a model that identifies misuse of the tutor.
5834868725ff05a97b014a01	Event coreference is an important task for full text analysis. However, previous work uses a variety of approaches, sources and evaluation, making the literature confusing and the results incommensurate. We provide a description of the differences to facilitate future research. Second, we present a supervised method for event coreference resolution that uses a rich feature set and propagates information alternatively between events and their arguments, adapting appropriately for each type of argument.
5834868725ff05a97b014a15	Who gets to use radio spectrum, and when, where, and how? Scheduling (who, where, when) and system configuration (how) are fundamental problems in radio communication and wireless networking. Optimization decomposition based on Lagrangian relaxation of signal quality requirements provides a mathematical framework for solving this type of combined problem. This paper demonstrates the technique as a solution to spatial reuse time-division multiple access (STDMA) scheduling with reconfigurable antennas.
5834868725ff05a97b014a1d	One of the most important components of any mobile system is the antenna; antenna design can overcome or cause a number of problems that then must be addressed at other technology layers. Modern mobile platforms are beginning to include novel antenna technology such as MIMO and beam steering; these technologies increase the complexity of evaluating the effectiveness of topology formation algorithms, routing and overall performance due to the large number of configuration states the system can contain.
5834868525ff05a97b010e43	CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results of this study shows that the 4-month administration of the association of Meriva and glucosamine can result in a faster onset of action and improved outcomes than the administration of an association of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine in patients with OA.
5834868725ff05a97b014181	Despite large-scale flooding attacks, capability-based defense schemes provide end hosts with guaranteed communication. However, facing the challenges of enabling scalable bandwidth fair sharing and adapting to attack strategies, none of the existing schemes adequately stand. In this paper we present Tumbler, a flooding attack defense mechanism that provides scalable competition-based bandwidth fairness at the Autonomous System (AS) granularity, and on-demand bandwidth allocation for end hosts in each AS.

5834868625ff05a97b0125ff	For the average person, the Internet is still too hard to use. We report evidence from HomeNet, a field trial in Pittsburgh that tries to understand how people use the Internet. Despite our reducing technological and economic barriers to use, families had problems connecting and using the Internet. We show that help calls, however, are not a good indicator of usability, since it is the “enthusiasts” and people with instrumental tasks to accomplish who call.
5834868625ff05a97b0132b9	Many context-aware services make the assumption that the context they use is completely accurate. However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. In this paper, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments.
5834868625ff05a97b012dc3	Controlling surface forces through nano/microstructure represents an important advancement in tribology. Primarily it suggests the possibility of fabricating adhesive and friction pads from a vast range of materials and processing methods, hence allowing for the production of tribological surfaces that are cheap, bio-compatible, durable, temperature resistant, and self-cleaning. Current research in this area draws inspiration from gecko lizards, which achieve rapid wall-climbing with arrays of keratinous, micron-sized fibers.
5834868725ff05a97b0150ec	Privacy policies describe high-level goals for corporate data practices; regulators require industries to make available conspicuous, accurate privacy policies to their customers. Consequently, software requirements must conform to those privacy policies. To help stakeholders extract privacy goals from policies, we introduce a semiautomated framework that combines crowdworker annotations, natural language typed dependency parses, and a reusable lexicon to improve goal-extraction coverage, precision, and recall.
5834868725ff05a97b015125	It has been observed in many instances that markets have a tendency to segment themselves into distinct sub-markets. This paper presents a multi-agent model that illustrates emergent market segmentation. The model illustrates the way local optimization processes result in an emergent global improvement of social welfare.
5834868725ff05a97b0158c9	We describe the first installment of the Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE), a new shared task for the NLG community. We motivate the design of the challenge, describe how we carried it out, and discuss the results of the system evaluation.
5834868725ff05a97b015145	Socio‐cultural cognitive maps (SCMs) are the best‐fit network model to the set of underlying node to variable data. SCM's permit objective visualization of the network, inference about the impact of changes in the underlying conditions influencing the nodes, and comparison of disparate data. This report details the process of creating and assessing these SCMs. First a general introduction is provided and then a step by step guide based on a cognitive walkthrough is presented.
5834868625ff05a97b01300e	Learning to argue in a computer-mediated and structured fashion is investigated in this research. A study was conducted to compare dyads that were scripted in their computer-mediated collaboration with dyads that were not scripted. A process analysis of the chats of the dyads showed that the scripted experimental group used significantly more words and engaged in significantly more broadening and deepening of the discussion than the non-scripted control group.
5834868625ff05a97b01152e	This installment of Notes from the Community covers new developments in interaction toolkits and platforms, security and privacy, smartphones, power consumption and battery life, and ubicomp education. It also includes a vision of ubicomp's past and future and presents works in progress on behavioral change.
5834868725ff05a97b013ece	Models of predictive coding frame perception as a generative process in which expectations constrain sensory representations. These models account for expectations about how a stimulus will move or change from moment to moment, but do not address expectations about what other, distinct stimuli are likely to appear based on prior experience. We show that such memory-based expectations in human visual cortex are related to the hippocampal mechanism of pattern completion.
5834868725ff05a97b014af2	PAC learning typically assumes that the training and test sets are drawn from the same distributions. This assumption often is violated in practice. How can machine learning algorithms be biased to output hypotheses that are robust to alterations in the test distribution? We create a framework for learning in environments where the test and training distributions di er because features in the test sets are likely to be missing or corrupted. Motivated by this framework, we present a new meta-learning algorithm, FeatureBoost.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION IN A DYNAMIC BAYES NET In a KT model, and in other dynamic Bayes net models for student modelling [Chang et al., 2006], we estimate the probability of a student knowing, learning, or forgetting the skill (s) required to perform each observed step. So, we use a latent variable to model a hidden knowledge state that changes over time, and infer it from sequential observations of the student's performance. If we know (or assume) which set of subskills a step __________________________________...
5834868625ff05a97b0135a8	We present a per-flow packet sampling method that enables the real-time classification of high-speed network traffic. Our method, based upon the partial sampling of each flow (ie, performing sampling at only early stages in each flow's lifetime), provides a sufficient reduction in total traffic (eg, a factor of five in packets, a factor of ten in bytes) as to allow practical implementations at one Gigabit/s, and, using limited hardware assistance, ten Gigabit/s.
5834868625ff05a97b0121ce	Flash ladar is a new class of range imaging sensors. Unlike traditional ladar devices that scan a collimated laser beam over the scene, flash ladar illuminates the entire scene with diffuse laser light. Recently, several companies have begun offering demonstration flash ladar units commercially. In this work, we seek to characterize the performance of two such devices, examining the effects of target range, reflectance and angle of incidence, as well as mixed pixel effects.
5834868625ff05a97b013242	The various robotic medical devices include robotic devices that are disposed within a body cavity and positioned using a support component disposed through an orifice or opening in the body cavity. Additional embodiments relate to devices having arms coupled to a device body wherein the device has a minimal profile such that the device can be easily inserted through smaller incisions in comparison to other devices without such a small profile. Further embodiments relate to methods of operating the above devices.
5834868725ff05a97b015950	While structured by social and institutional networks, disease outbreaks are modulated by physical, economical, technological, communication, health, and governmental infrastructures. To systematically reason about the nature of outbreaks, the potential outcomes of media, prophylaxis, and vaccination campaigns, and the relative value of various early warning devices, social context, and infrastructure, must be considered. Numerical models provide a cost-effective ethical system for reasoning about such events.
5834868625ff05a97b0129dc	We present the Carnegie Mellon University Stat-XFER group submission to the WMT 2010 shared translation task. Updates to our syntax-based SMT system mainly fell in the areas of new feature formulations in the translation model and improved filtering of SCFG rules. Compared to our WMT 2009 submission, we report a gain of 1.73 BLEU by using the new features and decoding environment, and a gain of up to 0.52 BLEU from improved grammar selection.
5834868625ff05a97b0129dd	This paper describes the French-English translation system developed by the Avenue research group at Carnegie Mellon University for the Seventh Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (NAACL WMT12). We present a method for training data selection, a description of our hierarchical phrase-based translation system, and a discussion of the impact of data size on best practice for system building.
5834868725ff05a97b0159c9	Modeling human understanding of natural language requires a model of the processes underlying human thought. No two people think exactly alike; different people subscribe to different beliefs and are motivated by different goals in their activities. A theory of subjective understanding has been proposed to account for subjectively-motivated human thinking ranging from ideological belief to human discourse and personality traits. A process-model embodying this theory has been implemented in a computer system, POLITICS.
5834868725ff05a97b014744	Modern buildings consist of hundreds of sensors and actuators for monitoring and operation of systems such as HVAC, light and security. To enable portable applications in next generation smart buildings, we need models and standardized ontologies that represent these sensors across diverse types of buildings. Recent research has shown that extracting information such as sensor type with available metadata and timeseries data analysis is difficult due to heterogeneity of systems and lack of support for interoperability.
5834868725ff05a97b0149b0	We provide efficient algorithms for learning disjunctions in the semi-supervised setting under a natural regularity assumption introduced by (Balcan & Blum, 2005). We prove bounds on the sample complexity of our algorithms under a mild restriction on the data distribution. We also give an active learning algorithm with improved sample complexity and extend all our algorithms to the random classification noise setting.
5834868725ff05a97b01376a	An important activity in collaborative writing is communicating about changes to texts,, This paper reports on a software system, ji'exible cliff, that finds and reports differences (“cliffs”) between versions of texts. The system is flexible, allowing users to control several aspects of its operation including what changes are reported and how they are shown when they are reported. We argue that such flexibility is necessary to support users' different social and cognitive needs.
5834868725ff05a97b014bc8	Kearns, Mansour, and Singh (2000) presented an algorithm, called Iterated Gradient Ascent (IGA), for two-player, two-action general-sum games, for which they proved that the average reward converges to that of a Nash equilibria. In this paper, we extend this algorithm to n-action games, and establish that IGA is a marginal best response against a large class of algorithms. We also compare and contrast marginal best response, Nash equilibria, and correlated equilibria, in order to compare IGA with other algorithms.
5834868625ff05a97b0135b5	We describe a general statistical and computational framework for the detection of anomalous spatial clusters, based on the spatial scan statistic [1]. Much of this material has been adapted from [2], to which we refer the reader for a more detailed discussion. We focus here on the purely spatial cluster detection task; for extensions to space-time cluster detection, the reader is referred to [3] and the references contained therein.
5834868625ff05a97b011185	A method for providing personalized news to a consumer is provided that includes receiving news from a plurality of external sources. A subset of the received news is identified based on a consumer profile for the consumer. The identified news is stored. The stored news is prioritized. At least a portion of the prioritized news is provided to the consumer.
5834868725ff05a97b015bae	We outline a learning framework that aims at identifying useful contextual cues for knowledge-based word sense disambiguation. The usefulness of individual context words is evaluated based on diverse lexico-statistical and syntactic information, as well as simple word distance. Experiments using two different knowledge-based methods and benchmark datasets show significant improvements due to context modeling, beating the conventional window-based approach.

5834868725ff05a97b0159ce	The authors extend existing supervised-learning and unsupervised-clustering algorithms to allow document classification based on the information content and temporal aspects of news events. They've adapted several IR and machine learning techniques for effective event detection and tracking. The article discusses our research using manually segmented documents.
5834868725ff05a97b0158fd	Since the beginning of the SAIBA effort to unify key interfaces in the multi-modal behavior generation process, the Behavior Markup Language (BML) has both gained ground as an important component in many projects worldwide, and continues to undergo further refinement. This paper reports on the progress made in the last year in further developing BML. It discusses some of the key challenges identified that the effort is facing, and reviews a number of projects that already are making use of BML or support its use.
5834868725ff05a97b014ab2	Inspired by work in semi-conservative collection, we have implemented a mostly-copying collector for an object-oriented language, including support for object pinning. Our collector efficiently manages fragmentation by measuring page residency and determining where copying can be most effective. This work in progress will form the foundation of our ongoing work in real-time collection.
5834868725ff05a97b014abc	We point out that a number of standard sample complexity bounds (VC-dimension, PAC-Bayes, and others) are all related to the number of bits required to communicate the labels given the unlabeled data for a natural communication game. Motivated by this observation, we give a general sample complexity bound based on this game that allows us to unify these different bounds in one common framework.
5834868625ff05a97b0135ed	We present a competitive online game called Search War, which collects data that is useful for improving Web search. Specifically, as a by product of gameplay, players will provide, for a given web page, an evaluation of its relevance to a particular search query as well as its most salient purpose.
5834868625ff05a97b011d57	Abstract—We have developed, built and tested a wearable device made to monitor, record and assist people in their daily lives, also known as First Person Vision device. It consists of a scene camera and a non-active lighting eye camera as well as audio and movements sensors. It is built to be worn on any type of eyeglasses and optimized for shape, size and weight. The resulting data are recorded on-board or transmitted to an external computer for further processing. Some images are captured and used successfully in vision algorithms.
5834868725ff05a97b014ac6	This paper gives an overview over the present state of the art in speech synthesis and its relationship to spoken output in education systems. The paper specifically looks at the use in general totorial systems, use in language learning and supporting new languages, and in voice conversion techniques that can produce speech similar to a specific speaker.
5834868625ff05a97b011d68	Optical flow is calculated for each patch on the basis of two images, and then a region having low confidence and a region having high confidence are separated depending on confidence of the optical flow, and the optical flow in the region having low confidence is interpolated using the optical flow in its surrounding regions.
5834868725ff05a97b01383f	This paper describes STAGE, a learning approach to automatically improving search performance on optimization problems. STAGE learns an evaluation function which predicts the outcome of a local search algorithm, such as hillclimbing or WALKSAT, as a function of state features along its search trajectories. The learned evaluation function is used to bias future search trajectories toward better optima. We present positive results on six large-scale optimization domains.
5834868725ff05a97b015bd1	We report serious bugs in floating-point computations for evaluating elementary functions in the Embedded GNU C Library. For instance, the sine function can return values larger than 1053 in certain rounding modes. Further investigation also exposed faulty implementations in the most recent version of the library, which seemingly fixed some bugs, but only by discarding user-specified rounding-mode requirements.

5834868625ff05a97b0135f5	This brief technical note concerns the question of when class hierarchies can be useful for improving accuracy of learned Bayesian classi ers. We show that the obvious hierarchical naive Bayes classi er is in fact equivalent to the standard non-hierarchical classi er under reasonable assumptions.
5834868625ff05a97b0111c5	This paper describes a method for increasing trust in a TV show recommender. We look for people in common between programs users watch and new programs that are highly rated by our TV show recommender. We then present these to users in a conversational sentence, helping them decide if they want to try the new show. This method has been implemeted in our current TV show recommender interface and will be tested in the near future.
5834868725ff05a97b015be0	BDDs (aBDDs) are obtained from ordinary BDDs by merging BDD nodes whose abstract values coincide. We discuss four types of abstract BDDs (called S-type, 0-type, 1-type and∨-type aBDDs) which have found applications in many CAD-related areas such as equivalence checking, variable ordering and model checking. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method.
5834868625ff05a97b0111d8	The present invention provides techniques for tracking objects in sports programs and for selecting an appropriate camera view. Generally, in response to preferences selected by a user, a particular object in a sporting event is tracked. Not only is the object tracked, but statistical data about the object is compiled and may be displayed, depending on user preferences. Additionally, a user can select particular cameras to view or can select certain portions of the playing field to view.
5834868625ff05a97b013604	The goal of the study was to identify the neural representation of a noun's meaning in one language based on the neural representation of that same noun in another language. Machine learning methods were used to train classifiers to identify which individual noun bilingual participants were thinking about in one language based solely on their brain activation in the other language. The study shows reliable (p<. 05) pattern-based classification accuracies for the classification of brain activity for nouns across languages.
5834868725ff05a97b014b14	The notion of exploiting data dependent hypothesis spaces is an exciting new direction in machine learning with strong theoretical foundations [66]. A very practical motivation for these techniques is that they allow us to exploit unlabeled data in new ways [2]. In this work we investigate a particular technique for combining “native” features with features derived from a similarity function. We also describe a novel technique for using unlabeled data to define a similarity function.
5834868625ff05a97b013610	The problem of concept learning, or forming a general description of a class of objects given a set of examples and non-examples, is viewed here as a search problem. Existing programs that generalize from examples are characterized in terms of the classes of search strategies that they employ. Several classes of search strategies are then analyzed and compared in terms of their relative capabilities and computational complexities.
5834868625ff05a97b01361e	We present a novel approach for multi-robot distributed and incremental inference over variables of interest, such as robot trajectories, considering the initial relative poses between the robots and multi-robot data association are both unknown. Assuming robots share with each other informative observations, this inference problem is formulated within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization, performed by each robot separately, alternating between inference over variables of interest and multi-robot data association.
5834868625ff05a97b0111f8	This paper is concerned with community discovery in textual interaction graph, where the links between entities are indicated by textual documents. Specifically, we propose a Topical Link Model (TLM), which leverages Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) to introduce hidden topical variable of the links. Other than the use of links, TLM can look into the documents on the links in detail to recover sound communities. Moreover, TLM is a nonparametric model, which is able to learn the number of communities from the data.

5834868725ff05a97b015c0b	Model checking has been successfully employed for verification of industrial hardware systems. Recently, model checking techniques have also enjoyed limited success in verifying software systems, viz., device drivers. However, there are several hurdles which must be overcome before model checking can be used to handle industrial-scale software systems. This article reviews some of the prominent model checking techniques being used for verification of software and summarizes the existing challenges in the field.
5834868725ff05a97b013935	Looks at how the SPID (statistically planned incremental deliveries) approach combines critical chain planning with incremental development and rate monitoring to help software developers meet project deadlines. SPID focuses on how best to organize a project to guarantee delivery of at least a working product with an agreed subset of the total functionality by the required date.
5834868625ff05a97b011206	This paper presents an end-to-end framework for task-oriented dialog systems using a variant of Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN). The model is able to interface with a relational database and jointly learn policies for both language understanding and dialog strategy. Moreover, we propose a hybrid algorithm that combines the strength of reinforcement learning and supervised learning to achieve faster learning speed. We evaluated the proposed model on a 20 Question Game conversational game simulator.
5834868625ff05a97b01362c	We explore logistic regression classifier (LogReg) and deep neural network (DNN) on the DCASE 2016 Challenge for task 3, ie, sound event detection in real life audio. Our models use the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and their deltas and accelerations as detection features. The error rate metric favors the simple logistic regression model with high activation threshold on both segment-and event-based contexts. On the other hand, DNN model outperforms the baseline in frame-based context.
5834868625ff05a97b012abf	Background: A major complication of severe acute pancreatitis is the vascular leak syndrome, which can result in intravascular volume depletion and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Angiopoietin-2 is an endothelial cell autocrine peptide, released by local injury and leading to destabilization of endothelial cells with increased vascular permeability.
5834868725ff05a97b014cbb	In this paper we present a general model for text analysis of Asian languages (Chinese and Japanese). That is a method for mapping strings of characters to strings of identified trivially pronounceable words. This work is based on the English Non-Standard Word analysis model suitably augmented to deal with both the lack of spaces between words in Japanese and Chinese and addressing the issues of homographs. Results are present for the sub-components of the process.
5834868725ff05a97b014cf0	Existing statistical approaches to natural language problems are very coarse approximations to the true complexity of language processing. As such, no single technique will be best for all problem instances. Many researchers are examining ensemble methods that combine the output of successful, separately developed modules to create more accurate solutions. This paper examines three merging rules for combining probability distributions: the well known mixture rule, the logarithmic rule, and a novel product rule.
5834868625ff05a97b013640	Huge amount of videos on the Internet have rare textual information, which makes video retrieval challenging given a text query. Previous work explored semantic concepts for content analysis to assist retrieval. However, the human-defined concepts might fail to cover the data and there is a potential gap between these concepts and the semantics expected from user's query. Also, building a corpus is expensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automatic framework to discover the semantic concepts.
5834868725ff05a97b014b41	This paper describes a method of analysing words through morphological decomposition when the lexicon is incomplete. The method is used within a text-to-speech system to help generate pronunciations of unknown words. The method is achieved within a general morphological analyser using Koskenniemi two-level rules.
5834868725ff05a97b014b45	This paper describes the latest version of the SOLE concept-to-speech system, which uses linguistic information provided by a natural language generation system to improve the prosody of synthetic speech. We discuss the types of linguistic information that prove most useful and the implications for text-to-speech systems.
5834868725ff05a97b014b4d	The Blizzard Challenge was started in 2005 as a way to evaluate different corpus speech synthesis techniques on a common data set. It has been noted that it is very hard to evaluate different speech synthesis techniques when different size and quality databases are used to build a voice. To remove the variable of database size and speaker quality, we proposed a common database that all participants would use.
5834868725ff05a97b014b64	Human communication literature states that people with different culture backgrounds act differently in conversations. Currently most virtual agents are designed for a single targeted popular culture. We implemented two versions of a virtual agent targeting American and Chinese cultures. We found that users from different culture context express engagement differently.
5834868725ff05a97b014b69	At the Cocosda meeting in September 1997 in Rhodes, Greece it was decided to set up a TTS server website. The above authors constitute a committee that will describe, design and make operational such a TTS website. The TTS server will permit immediate access to a variety of systems, whereas a text server will allow controlled access to a variety of texts. The prototype version of this website, running at LDC, is presented. Presently 8 text-tospeech systems are accessible.
5834868725ff05a97b014b77	This paper gives a computational description of Japanese morphology. The description is given in terms of the Edinburgh/Cambridge Dictionary and Morphological Analyser system (MAP) which is part of the Alvey Natural Language Tools. This paper exists for two reasons rstly as a description of Japanese Morphology but also as a description of how more complex morphological systems can be described within the analyser system.
5834868725ff05a97b01367d	Speech-user interfaces offer truly hands-free, eyes-free interaction, have unmatched throughput rates, and are the only plausible interaction modality for illiterate users across the world, but they are not yet developed in abundance to support every type of user, language, or acoustic scenario. Two approaches present exciting opportunities for future research.

5834868725ff05a97b014b7f	This paper studies two ways for helping non-specialist users develop speech systems from limited data for new languages. Focused web re-crawling finds additional examples of text matching the domain as specified by the user. This improves the language model and cuts word error rate nearly in half. Iterative voice building with interleaved lexicon construction uses the voice from a previous iteration to help construct an improved voice. 4.5 hours of the user's time reduces transcription error rate from 32% to 4%.
5834868725ff05a97b013685	Data compression can be an effective method to achieve higher system performance and energy efficiency in modern data-intensive applications by exploiting redundancy and data similarity. Prior works have studied a variety of data compression techniques to improve both capacity (eg, of caches and main memory) and bandwidth utilization (eg, of the on-chip and off-chip interconnects). In this paper, we make a new observation about the energy-efficiency of communication when compression is applied.
5834868725ff05a97b01369a	The present invention provides a prefetch system for use with a cache memory associated with a database employing indices. In one embodiment, the prefetch system includes a search subsystem configured to prefetch cache lines containing an index of a node of a tree structure associated with the database. Additionally, the prefetch system also includes a scan subsystem configured to prefetch cache lines based on an index prefetch distance between first and second leaf nodes of the tree structure.
5834868725ff05a97b014b92	The Tongues speech-to-speech translation system was developed for the US Army chaplains, with fairly stringent constraints on time, budget, and available data. The resulting prototype was required to undergo a quite realistic field test. We describe the development and architecture of the system, the field test, and our analysis of its results. The system performed quite well, especially given its development constraints.
5834868725ff05a97b014b9c	This paper proposes the use of situation theory as a basic semantic formalism for defining general semantic theories. ASTL, a computational situation theoretic language, is described which goes some way to offering such a system. After a general description of Discourse Representation Theory an encoding of DRT in ASTL is given. Advantages and disadvantages of this method are then discussed.
5834868725ff05a97b014bb0	Qatar is a worldwide leader in liquid natural gas (LNG) production and is poised to lead the world in gas-to-liquids (GTL) production with the commissioning of the Pearl GTL facility. Unfortunately, Qatar's gas fields contain non-negligible quantities of corrosive and toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), resulting in the ongoing need for expensive and labor intensive pipe inspection to detect and monitor areas of corrosion. Such inspection is critical to plant integrity, worker safety, and to ensure the economic productivity of the facility.
5834868625ff05a97b011620	A method of objectively quantifying assessments of joints having arthritis for purposes of assessment, diagnosis and treatment. The objective measurements utilize known imaging modalities including 3D scanning, thermal imaging, visible and near-infrared imaging and two-dimensional imaging to quantify swelling, heat distribution, erythema, and range or motion. The objective measurements can be combined in various ways to assess the extent of the disease and can be used to adjust treatment protocols.
5834868725ff05a97b0156ca	Robust reasoning requires learning from problem solving episodes. Past experience must be compiled to provide adaptation to new contingencies and intelligent modification of solutions to past problems. This paper presents a comprehensive computational model of analogical reasoning that transitions smoothly between case replay, case adaptation, and general problem solving, exploiting and modifying past experience when available and resorting to general problem-solving methods when required.
5834868725ff05a97b0156ce	The field of machine learning strives to develop methods and techniques to automate the acquisition of new information, new skills, and new ways of organizing existing information. This article reviews the major approaches to machine learning in symbolic domains, illustrated with occasional paradigmatic examples.
5834868725ff05a97b013a8a	Many programming by demonstration (PBD) systems elaborate on the idea of macro recording, and they allow users to extend existing applications. Few, however, allow new interfaces to be created from scratch because they do not provide a means of demonstrating when a recorded macro should be invoked. This paper discusses stimulus-response systems that allow both the when (stimulus/event) and the what (response macro) to be demonstrated.
5834868625ff05a97b012b70	We present a novel extension of normal form games that we call biased games. In these games, a player's utility is influenced by the distance between his mixed strategy and a given base strategy. We argue that biased games capture important aspects of the interaction between software agents. Our main result is that biased games satisfying certain mild conditions always admit an equilibrium. We also tackle the computation of equilibria in biased games.
5834868725ff05a97b015455	We introduce a novel centrality metric, the neighbor vector centrality. It is a measurement of node importance with respect to the degree distribution of the node neighbors. This centrality is explored in the context of several networks. We use attack vulnerability simulation to compared our approach with three standard centrality approaches. While for real-world network our method outperforms the other three metrics, for synthetic networks it shows a slightly weak properties but still a good measure overall.

The goal of ow work is to use range data from an ENhi laser range finder to build a three-dimensional description of the environment. We describe techniques for building both low-level description, such as obsfacle maps or terrain maps, av well as higher level description using model-bared object recognition. We have integrated these techniques in the NAW qstm [IO].
5834868725ff05a97b01547a	Multi-agent dynamic-networks simulations are emerging as a powerful technique for reasoning about complex socio-cultural systems at sufficient fidelity that they can support policy development. Within these models the way in which the agents are modeled and the fidelity of the system are critical. Basic principles guiding the development and use of these models to support policy development are described.
5834868725ff05a97b013fa7	Everyone knows that designing and implementing human-computer interface is difficult and time-consuming. However, there is little discussion of why this is true. Should we expect that a new method is around the corner that will make the design easier? Will the next generation of user interface toolkits make the implementation trivial? No. This article discusses reasons why user interface design and implementation are inherently difficult tasks and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
5834868625ff05a97b012f5a	The adaptive fusion of video and audio is one of the fundamental pursuits of audio visual speech recognition (AVSR). In this paper the use of a high dimensional secondary classifier on the word likelihood scores from both the audio and video modalities is investigated for the purposes of adaptive fusion. Results are presented that lie above or equal to the boundary of catastrophic fusion across a number of audio noise levels.
5834868625ff05a97b012d41	Similarly, User models can be useful for improving dialogue management. In this paper we analyze human-robot dialogues that occur during uncontrolled interactions and estimate relations between the initial dialogue turns and patterns of discourse that are indicative of such user traits as persistence and politeness. The significant effects shown in this preliminary study suggest that initial dialogue turns may be useful in modeling a user's interaction style.
5834868625ff05a97b011169	Here we present findings of a needs validation study of 18-25 year old women and their wardrobes. Based on their feedback, we developed a prototype system that allows for borrowing and sharing of information about clothing via Facebook. The novelty of our interface lies in its combining RFID tags and social networking. In doing so we bridge the material and virtual realms and demonstrate the importance of material culture for ubiquitous computing.

For each language track, we tune a standard phrase-based SMT system to a variety of metrics including BLEU, TER, and several variations of METEOR. We select a balanced Tuning version of METEOR that performs well across tracks as the tuning metric for our official submissions.
5834868625ff05a97b0129d1	By adopting a “first-things-first” approach we overcome a number of challenges inherent in developing NLP Systems for resource-scarce languages. By first gathering the necessary corpora and lexicons we are then enabled to build, for Mapudungun, a spelling-corrector, morphological analyzer, and two Mapudungun-Spanish machine translation systems; and for Quechua, a morphological analyzer as well as a rule-based Quechua-Spanish machine translation system.
5834868625ff05a97b0129d8	In this paper, we describe an approach to analysis for spoken language translation that combines phrase-level grammar-based parsing and automatic domain action classification. The job of the analyzer is to transform utterances into a shallow semantic task-oriented interlingua representation. The goal of our hybrid approach is to provide accurate real-time analyses and to improve robustness and portability to new domains and languages.

5834868725ff05a97b0137c3	We propose a fast 3D model acquisition system that aligns intensity and depth images, and reconstructs a textured 3D mesh. 3D views are registered with shape alignment based on intensity gradient constraints and a global registration algorithm. We reconstruct the 3D model using a new cubic ray projection merging algorithm which takes advantage of a novel data structure: the linked voxel space. Finally, we present experiments to test the accuracy of our approach on 3D face modeling using real-time stereo images.

5834868725ff05a97b014bd4	We consider an extension of the standard on-line model to settings in which an on-line algorithm has free time between successive requests in an input sequence. During this free time, the algorithm may perform operations without charge before receiving the next request. For instance, in planning the motion of re trucks, there may be time in between res that one could use to reposition the trucks in anticipation of the next re. We prove both upper and lower bounds on the power of deterministic and randomized algorithms in this model.
5834868725ff05a97b015ba5	Block-LDA is a topic modeling approach to perform data fusion between entity-annotated text documents and graphs with entity-entity links. We evaluate Block-LDA in the yeast biology domain by jointly modeling PubMed® articles and yeast protein-protein interaction networks. The topic coherence of the emergent topics and the ability of the model to retrieve relevant scientific articles and proteins related to the topic are compared to that of a text-only approach that does not make use of the protein-protein interaction matrix.

TransCenter is free, open source, and platform independent software.
5834868725ff05a97b0156e0	A methodology is presented for component-based machine translation (MT) evaluation through causal error analysis to complement existing global evaluation methods. This methodology is particularly appropriate for knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) systems. After a discussion of MT evaluation criteria and the particular evaluation metrics proposed for KBMT, we apply this methodology to a large-scale application of the KANT machine translation system, and present some sample results.
5834868725ff05a97b015c4e	Varied sources of error contribute to the challenge of facial action unit detection. Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else; a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples.
5834868725ff05a97b0156e1	Summary Classifying biological data is a common task in the biomedical context. Predicting the class of new, unknown information allows researchers to gain insight and make decisions based on the available data. Also, using classification methods often implies choosing the best parameters to obtain optimal class separation, and the number of parameters might be large in biological datasets.
5834868725ff05a97b0153d9	We consider the problem of converting a set of numeric data points into a smoothed approximation of the underlying probability distribution.

5834868625ff05a97b0123e8	In this paper we describe a trainable object detector and its instantiations for detecting faces and cars at any size, location, and pose. To cope with variation in object orientation, the detector uses multiple classifiers, each spanning a different range of orientation. Each of these classifiers determines whether the object is present at a specified size within a fixed-size image window. To find the object at any location and size, these classifiers scan the image exhaustively.

5834868625ff05a97b01312d	Combining peer tutoring with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) holds the promise of augmenting the current benefits of the ITS. We designed and implements a peer tutoring approach as a addition to the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA), an ITS for high school algebra. We then used 30 students to evaluate the potential of the peer tutoring addition to increase learning. Although students learned and interacted positively. peer tutors lacked the necessary expertise to adequately help their tutees.
5834868625ff05a97b013131	Chemistry students often learn to solve problems by applying well-practiced procedures, but such a mechanical approach is likely to hinder conceptual understanding. We have developed a system aimed at promoting conceptual learning in chemistry by having dyads collaborate on problems in a virtual laboratory (VLab), assisted by a collaboration script. We conducted a small study to compare an adaptive and a non-adaptive version of the system, with the adaptive version controlled by a human wizard.
5834868625ff05a97b0122dc	Sketching has long been an essential medium of design cognition, recognized for its ability to fluidly represent design concepts across a range of formality and styles.

5834868625ff05a97b01242c	This thesis deals with the development and analysis of motion planning algorithms for high dimensional systems: humanoid robots and digital actors. Several adaptations of generic randomized motion planning methods are proposed and discussed. A first contribution concerns the use of linear dimensionality reduction techniques to speed up sampling algorithms. This method identifies on line when a planning process goes through a narrow passage of some configuration space, and adapts the exploration accordingly.
5834868725ff05a97b0156e4	We describe a Machine Translation (MT) approach that is specifically designed to enable rapid development of MT for languages with limited amounts of online resources. Our approach assumes the availability of a small number of bi-lingual speakers of the two languages, but these need not be linguistic experts. The bi-lingual speakers create a comparatively small corpus of word aligned phrases and sentences (on the order of magnitude of a few thousand sentence pairs) using a specially designed elicitation tool.

5834868625ff05a97b012a94	We present a novel parser combination scheme that works by reparsing input sentences once they have already been parsed by several different parsers. We apply this idea to dependency and constituent parsing, generating results that surpass state-of-the-art accuracy levels for individual parsers.
5834868725ff05a97b01570d	Most successful automated formal verification tools are based on a bit-level model of computation, where a set of Boolean state variables encodes the system state.

5834868725ff05a97b014bdf	We consider a setting where n buyers, with combinatorial preferences over m items, and a seller, running a priority-based allocation mechanism, repeatedly interact. Our goal, from observing limited information about the results of these interactions, is to reconstruct both the preferences of the buyers and the mechanism of the seller. More specifically, we consider an online setting where at each stage, a subset of the buyers arrive and are allocated items, according to some unknown priority that the seller has among the buyers.

5834868725ff05a97b01542d	The Saturn sold 9.4 million units worldwide.[3] While its installed base in the United States ended at 2 million,[5] its installed base in Japan was more than 6 million units.[citation needed] While it was popular in Japan, the Saturn failed to gain a similar market share in North America and Europe against its main competitors: Sony's PlayStation and later the Nintendo 64.
5834868625ff05a97b013431	Micro reading in machine reading can be compared to deep reading in human reading. Deep reading has been defined as a set of processes that enable comprehension and that include inferential and deductive reasoning, analogical skills, critical analysis, reflection, and insight. In this paper, we sketch what we envision to be a viable approach to micro reading. The proposed approach leverages the knowledge that has been acquired by the machine readers that have been developed to date.
5834868625ff05a97b011cd3	Here we accelerate computations that reduce CT metal artifacts by observing that metal projects to only a fraction of the X-ray detectors in each projection, and thus computations should focus on these metal “mask” regions. We propose that the penalized maximum likelihood optimization method for artifact reduction needs to be solved only within the metal mask, using the remaining non-mask regions as a constraint; we show that our approach leads to a 10x speedup.
5834868625ff05a97b013562	The LSST will survey the sky with a cadence of several visits per month spaced by approximately a week. This time sampling enables a detailed census of Solar System objects ranging from over a million Main Belt Asteroids, to 20,000 Trans Neptunian Objects and even potentially hazardous asteroids. The challenge in identifying all potential asteroid associations is that it can be very computationally expensive (due to the many potential tracks that must be tested in order to isolate true orbits).

5834868625ff05a97b01127f	It is not enough for natural language text simply to be generated, it must also be layed ouit in an appropriate format. Different modes of text (plain text, itemized lists, enumerations, inserts, etc.) are used systematically in order to convey information additional to the primary content of the text. In this paper we apply and extend ideas from earlier work on the automatic allocation of presentation media to given information, and on text planning, to the problem of text layout.

The positive effects of such questions vanished during the second half of the siudi in 2IKI3 We hypothesize why.
5834868625ff05a97b011e0f	We propose an approach to identify and segment objects from scenes that a person (or robot) encounters in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Images collected in those cluttered scenes contain multiple objects. Each image provides only a partial, possibly very different view of each object. An object instance discovery program must be able to link pieces of visual information from multiple images and extract the consistent patterns. Most papers on unsupervised discovery of object models are concerned with object categories.
5834868625ff05a97b0112a5	This paper describes CMU's system for the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (TEDL) task at TAC-KBP 2015.

The results show that our system achieves competitive results for Chinese and Spanish.
5834868725ff05a97b014dfc	After finding all exactly-matching phrases (single words are not matched), subsentential alignment is attempted to find the proper portion of the translated sentence for the source phrase. If this fails to find a sufficiently good alignment, the match is discarded and the next one examined.
5834868625ff05a97b012ae9	The von Mises model encodes a multivariate circular distribution as an undirected probabilistic graphical model. Presently, the only algorithm for performing inference in the model is Gibbs sampling, which becomes inefficient for large graphs. To address this issue, we introduce an Expectation Propagation based algorithm for performing inference in the von Mises graphical model. Our approach introduces a moment-matching technique for trigonometric functions to approximate the Expectation Propagation messages efficiently.
5834868725ff05a97b014e05	The Tongues speech-to-speech translation system was developed for the US Army chaplains, with fairly stringent constraints on time, budget, and available data.

The system performed quite well, especially given its development constraints.
5834868725ff05a97b015890	We develop an efficient representation and a pre-unification algorithm in the style of Huet (1975) for the linear/spl lambda/-calculus/spl lambda//sup/spl rarr//spl rArr/0&T/which includes intuitionistic functions (/spl rarr/), linear functions (/spl rArr/), additive pairing (&), and additive unit (T). Applications lie in proof scorch, logic programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We also show that, surprisingly, a similar pre-unification algorithm does not exist for certain sublanguages.
5834868625ff05a97b0134ae	This abstract summarizes how we improved task choice-picking a story to read-in successive versions of a Reading Tutor that listens to elementary students read aloud. We wanted to motivate children to spend time on the Reading Tutor by giving them some choice in what to read, without spending too much time picking stories. We also wanted them to read plenty of new text, so as to build vocabulary and decoding skills.

5834868725ff05a97b015740	The paper describes a new technique for extracting clock level finite state machines (FSMs) from transistor netlists using symbolic simulation. The transistor netlist is preprocessed to produce a gate level representation of the netlist. Given specifications of the circuit clocking and input and output timing, simulation patterns are derived for a symbolic simulator. The result of the symbolic simulation and extraction process is the next state and output function of the equivalent FSM, represented as Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.
5834868725ff05a97b015c85	This paper investigates the effect of meta-cognitive help in the context of learning by teaching. Students learned to solve algebraic equations by tutoring a teachable agent, called SimStudent, using an online learning environment, called APLUS. A version of APLUS was developed to provide meta-cognitive help on what problems students should teach, as well as when to quiz SimStudent. A classroom study comparing APLUS with and without the meta-cognitive help was conducted with 173 seventh to ninth grade students.
5834868625ff05a97b012b82	We argue that synthesizing operations on recursive linked data structures is not as hard as it appears and is, in fact, within reach of current SAT-based synthesis techniques-with the addition of a simple approach that we describe to decompose the problem into smaller parts. To generate smaller pieces of code, ie, shorter routines, is obviously easier than large and complex routines, and, also, there is more potential for automating the code synthesis.
5834868625ff05a97b012c55	Mobile manipulators have brought a new level of flexibility to traditional automation tasks such as tabletop manipulation, but are not yet capable of the same speed and reliability as industrial automation. We present approaches to 3D perception and manipulator motion planning that enable a general purpose robotic platform to recognize and manipulate a variety of objects at a rate of one pick-and-place operation every 6.7 s, and work with a conveyor belt carrying objects at a speed of 33 cm/s.
5834868725ff05a97b014e2f	A semantic and pragmatic interpreter that combines automatic and interactive disambiguation is described. This augmentor has an interactive disambiguation component that is called upon to aid automatic disambiguation when automated strategies prove inadequate. In addition to interactive disambiguation, the augmentor also provides the user interface for the KBMT-89 project.
5834868625ff05a97b012f80	For facial expression recognition systems to be applicable in the real world, they need to be able to detect and track a previously unseen person's face and its facial movements accurately in realistic environments. A highly plausible solution involves performing a “dense” form of alignment, where 60-70 fiducial facial points are tracked with high accuracy. The problem is that, in practice, this type of dense alignment had so far been impossible to achieve in a generic sense, mainly due to poor reliability and robustness.
5834868625ff05a97b0134fa	A computerized method for optimizing parameters is described. A system can initialize a group of parameters to respective values within a set of allowable models and bound a partition function across a number of variable pairs to generate a plurality of bounds. The system can also determine new values for the group of parameters that minimize a sum of the plurality of bounds. The system can set the group of parameters to the new values and optimize the parameters by iteratively performing the bounding, determining and setting.
5834868625ff05a97b011bd9	Abstract—Time-to-collision provides vital information for obstacle avoidance and for the visual navigation of a robot. The original contribution of this paper is to demonstrate with sequences of real images that time-to-oollision can be robustly and accurately recovered with a single calibrated camera, using ﬁrst order models of the motion ﬁeld.
5834868625ff05a97b013501	A method for assessing suicide risk for a human subject including receiving recorded voice data of the subject; and classifying the subject as suicidal or non-suicidal based upon a computerized analysis of one or more nonverbal characteristics of the speech data, especially features associated with a breathy phonation type. The analysis of the nonverbal characteristics of the voice data can include an analysis of acoustic characteristics of speech, and/or an analysis of prosodic and voice quality-related features of the voice data.
5834868625ff05a97b01111e	A new, interactive, television program profile interface and method are described. The interface is used to capture and display the likes and dislikes of a television viewer in multi-axis format. The weighting of the viewer's preferences proportionately changes over time. Those preferences are illustrated in bar graph format with respect to time or other axes. The viewer interacts with the graphical representations by time traversing the preferential chart, and providing necessary modifications and updates.
5834868625ff05a97b012b89	We introduce recurrent neural network grammars, probabilistic models of sentences with explicit phrase structure. We explain efficient inference procedures that allow application to both parsing and language modeling. Experiments show that they provide better parsing in English than any single previously published supervised generative model and better language modeling than state-of-the-art sequential RNNs in English and Chinese.
5834868725ff05a97b015782	Compute-intensive applications are emerging in intelligent home, retail store and automotive industries. These applications are becoming more sophisticated with new features rich in audio, video, image, and machine learning capabilities that demand heavy computations.

5834868725ff05a97b013704	How can an automated tutor assess children's spoken responses despite imperfect speech recognition? We address this challenge in the context of tutoring children in explicit strategies for reading comprehension. We report initial progress on collecting, annotating, and mining their spoken responses. Collection and annotation yield authentic but sparse data, which we use to synthesize additional realistic data. We train and evaluate a classifier to estimate the probability that a response mentions a given target.

5834868625ff05a97b0135ce	A computer program which generates empirical rules associating 13 C NMR shifts with local structural environments is described. The program uses a heuristic method to search for common structural features for those carbon atoms exhibiting similar shifts. Rules have been generated by our program from a combined set of acyclic amine and paraffin data. Examples of these rules are presented, and their performance as a tool for structure elucidation is examined.

5834868625ff05a97b011c08	Systems and method for generating three dimensional (3D) models of bones are described. In one embodiment, a method of generating a 3D model of a bone can include determining contours of the bone based two dimensional (2D) images of the bone and, based on the contours, modifying a 3D template model of the bone to generate a 3D model of the bone.
5834868625ff05a97b011126	A sorting mechanism sorts results utilizing one or more sort keys selected based upon the user task context, the content type relating to the items being sorted, and/or user-preferences. Intuitive or default sort keys such as program/song title are selected based on the user's objectives as inferred from task parameters or user selection of primary sort keys, but may be changed by the user, with the results are displayed in an ordered listing based on the sorting with the selected sort keys.
5834868625ff05a97b012941	In this paper, we discuss a haptically enhanced broadcasting system. Four stages of a proposed system are briefly analyzed: scene capture, edit, transmission, and display with haptic interaction. In order to show usefulness of the proposed system, a potential home shopping scenario is implemented.
5834868725ff05a97b01496e	Driven by curiosity and our own three diverse smartphone application usage datasets, we sought to unpack the nuances of mobile device use by revisiting two recent Mobile HCI studies [1, 17]. Our goal was to add to our broader understanding of smartphone usage by investigating if differences in mobile device usage occurred not only across our three datasets, but also in relation to prior work. We found differences in the top-10 apps in each dataset, in the durations and types of interactions as well as in micro-usage patterns.
5834868725ff05a97b0145ec	This paper explores log-based query expansion (QE) models for Web search. Three lexicon models are proposed to bridge the lexical gap between Web documents and user queries. These models are trained on pairs of user queries and titles of clicked documents. Evaluations on a real world data set show that the lexicon models, integrated into a ranker-based QE system, not only significantly improve the document retrieval performance but also outperform two state-of-the-art log-based QE methods.

5834868625ff05a97b0112ed	The Seventh International Workshop on Natural Language Generation was held from 21 to 24 June 1994 in Kennebunkport, Maine. Sixty-seven people from 13 countries attended this 4-day meeting on the study of natural language generation in computational linguistics and AI. The goal of the workshop was to introduce new, cutting-edge work to the community and provide an atmosphere in which discussion and exchange would flourish.
5834868625ff05a97b011e47	Many elders experience cognitive decline as they get older. Occasional lapses in memory, attention, or decision-making are a normal part of aging, but consistent cognitive problems may be the first signs of progressive neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Cognitive decline usually manifests itself first as changes in an individual's functional ability, that is, the ability to carry out everyday activities such as preparing a meal, taking medication, using the telephone, and doing housework.

5834868725ff05a97b013719	A long-standing challenge for knowledge tracing is how to update estimates of multiple subskills that underlie a single observable step. We characterize approaches to this problem by how they model knowledge tracing, fit its parameters, predict performance, and update subskill estimates. Previous methods allocated blame or credit among subskills in various ways based on strong assumptions about their relation to observed performance. LRDBN relaxes these assumptions by using logistic regression in a Dynamic Bayes Net.
5834868725ff05a97b015cb0	Because of polysemy, distant labeling for information extraction leads to noisy training data. We describe a procedure for reducing this noise by using label propagation on a graph in which the nodes are entity mentions, and mentions are coupled when they occur in coordinate list structures. We show that this labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers are used on the distantly-labeled data.

5834868725ff05a97b014ade	The Dialog Research Center at Carnegie Mellon (DialRC) is organizing the REAL Challenge. The goal of the REAL Challenge (dialrc. org/realchallenge) is to build speech systems that are used regularly by real users to accomplish real tasks. These systems will give the speech and spoken dialog communities steady streams of research data as well as platforms they can use to carry out studies. It will engage both seasoned researchers and high school and undergrad students in an effort to find the next great speech applications.
5834868725ff05a97b013706	We describe a transformational derivation system that semi-automatically derives a simplified version of Mycin's therapy selection algorithm. It uses general transformation rules to explicitly integrate the multiple, sometimes conflicting goals that govern the design of heuristic algorithms. The generality of its transformations is demonstrated by using them to derive a variation based on formulating and integrating the same design goals differently.
5834868625ff05a97b0135a5	This paper describes a bio-surveillance system designed to detect anomalous patterns in pharmacy retail data.

Fast space-time scan statistics are used to detect disease outbreaks, and user feedback is incorporated to improve system utility and usability.
5834868625ff05a97b01118a	A display mechanism for showing search results, which is well-suited to displaying programming events on an electronic program guide, selectively aggregates items in result lists according to features having identical or similar values. Each aggregated item is represented by a respective symbol. A user interface may be provided to permit the selective expansion of the symbols. The resulting list has much less repetition than a list according to the prior art in which each search result is shown explicitly.
5834868725ff05a97b01375c	The use of networks of computers for human communication is surprising and fascinating. Electronic mail (email) becomes an important tool of any organization whose members spend a lot of time using computers. This paper reports on the state of email activity at Carnegie Mellon where thousands of students, faculty, and staff have been using the Andrew system during its development over the last few years. There is some analysis of why and how email works and what it will take for it to become more widespread.

As a first step, we overview the issues and available tools in three key areas of virtual human research: face-to-face conversation, emotions and personality, and human figure animation. Assembling a virtual human is still a daunting task, but the building blocks are getting bigger and better every day.
5834868725ff05a97b014e76	Linguistic labels such as high, medium, and low are commonly used in different applications. Researchers in psychometrics argue that before adding new labels to applications, the labels must be empirically evaluated. In this paper, we explain the process of selecting labels for a security assessment application. We also show how we evaluate the labels empirically using a sample population from Amazon Mechanical Turk users.
5834868725ff05a97b015cbc	In this paper, we propose a single low-dimensional representation of a large collection of table and hyponym data, and show that with a small number of primitive operations, this representation can be used effectively for many purposes. Specifically we consider queries like set expansion, class prediction etc. We evaluate our methods on publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web.
5834868725ff05a97b013ce1	The authors present a multimodal approach to interactive recovery from speech recognition errors for the design of speech user interfaces. They propose a framework to compare various error recovery methods, arguing that a rational user will prefer interaction methods which provide an optimal trade off between accuracy, speed and naturalness. They describe a prototypical implementation of multimodal interactive error recovery and present results from a preliminary evaluation in form filling and speech to speech translation tasks.
5834868725ff05a97b01375f	People use computers to accomplish tasks. Consequently, understanding human capabilities and tasks is as important to the design of computer systems as understanding computer technologies. The School of Computer Science (SCS) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has become home to an interdisciplinary community that performs research on HCI issues, develops systems using HCI methods of design and evaluation, and trains students in the theory and skills necessary to become HCI professionals.
5834868625ff05a97b012d42	Previous research has shown that design features that support privacy are essential for new technologies looking to gain widespread adoption. As such, privacy-sensitive design will be important for the adoption of social robots, as they could introduce new types of privacy risks to users. In this paper, we report findings from our preliminary study on users' perceptions and attitudes toward privacy in human-robot interaction, based on interviews that we conducted about a workplace social robot.

5834868725ff05a97b014284	Speech technologies nowadays available on mobile devices show an increased performance both in terms of the language that they are able to capture and in terms of reliability. The availability of performant speech recognition engines suggests the deployment of vocal interfaces also in consumer robots. In this paper, we report on our current work, by specifically focussing on the difficulties that arise in grounding the user's utterances in the environment where the robot is operating.
5834868625ff05a97b012310	If the machines of some type A have enough resources to (i) solve problems that no machine of type B can solve, and (ii) simulate any unary two-way deterministic finite automaton that has access to a linearly-bounded counter, then typically no recursive function can upper bound the increase in the size of description when a machine of type A is replaced by an equivalent machine of type B.
5834868625ff05a97b01266a	It is difficult to build intelligent tutoring systems in the domain of programming due to the complexity and variety of possible answers. To simplify this process, we have constructed a languageindependent canonicalized model for programming solutions. This model allows for much greater overlap across different students than a basic text model, which enables more self-sustaining hint generation methods in programming tutors.

5834868725ff05a97b01446e	Open collaborative authoring systems such as Wikipedia are growing in use and impact. This research examines how to create a collaborative authoring community for educational resources. We describe and evaluate a novel tool for community authoring of worked examples, in the task of making instruction for a specific math skill. Participants were professional teachers (math and non-math) and amateurs. We find that while there are differences by teaching status, all three groups made contributions of worth.
5834868625ff05a97b01307d	Human routines are blueprints of behavior, which allow people to accomplish purposeful repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their day to how they drive through an intersection. People express their routines through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines.
5834868725ff05a97b013769	This paper reports research to define a set of interaction parameters that collaborative writers will find useful. Our approach is to provide parameters of interaction and to locate the decision of how to set the parameters with the users. What is new in this paper is the progress we have made outlining task management parameters, notification, scenarios of use, as well as some implementation architectures.
5834868725ff05a97b013d1a	Dividing a program into segments and executing each segment at the core best suited to run it can improve performance and save power. When consecutive segments run on different cores, accesses to intersegment data incur cache misses. Data Marshaling eliminates such cache misses by identifying and marshaling the necessary intersegment data when a segment is shipped to a remote core.

5834868725ff05a97b014eec	In this article, the task of acquisition of subsentential paraphrases is discussed and several automatic techniques are presented. We describe an evaluation methodology to compare these techniques and some of their combinations. This methodology is applied on two corpora of sentential paraphrases obtained by multiple translations. The conclusions that are drawn can be used to guide future work for improving existing techniques.
5834868725ff05a97b0137a9	We have developed an interactive virtual audience platform for public speaking training. Users' public speaking behavior is automatically analyzed using audiovisual sensors. The virtual characters display indirect feedback depending on user's behavior descriptors correlated with public speaking performance. We used the system to collect a dataset of public speaking performances in different training conditions.
5834868725ff05a97b014eee	In this work, we present a scenario where contextual targeted paraphrasing of sub-sentential phrases is performed automatically to support the task of text revision. Candidate paraphrases are obtained from a preexisting repertoire and validated in the context of the original sentence using information derived from the Web. We report on experiments on French, where the original sentences to be rewritten are taken from a rewriting memory automatically extracted from the edit history of Wikipedia.
5834868625ff05a97b012276	According to the definition used by Box & Tiao (1973) for a likelihood to be 'data translated'it must have location form in terms of a sufficient statistic. In contrast to Jeffreys's arguments for a uniform prior, theirs does not cover cases such as the Cauchy location family, and is in this sense stronger than the group-theoretic criterion of invariance. Their definition is easily modified to cover such cases through the introduction of an ancillary statistic, and their argument in favour of a uniform prior then becomes group-theoretic.

Scientific literature that has used the model is listed as well as representative examples of real-world use within organizations. The report also defines the input and output variables and describes the various input and output files used with Construct. System requirements and performance characteristics are provided. Illustrative examples furnish a minitutorial on how to run virtual experiments with Construct.
5834868625ff05a97b01227a	It has been observed that spike count correlation between two simultaneously recorded neurons often increases with the length of time interval examined. Under simple assumptions that are roughly consistent with much experimental data, we show that this phenomenon may be explained as being due to excess trial-to-trial variation. The resulting formula for the correlation is able to predict the observed correlation of two neurons recorded from primary visual cortex as a function of interval length.
5834868625ff05a97b012d55	We present the design of the Snackbot, a robot that will deliver snacks in our university buildings. The robot is intended to provide a useful, continuing service and to serve as a research platform for long-term Human-Robot Interaction. Our design process, which occurred over 24 months, is documented as a contribution for others in HRI who may be developing social robots that offer services. We describe the phases of the design project, and the design decisions and tradeoffs that led to the current version of the robot.
5834868625ff05a97b012f1e	Energy harvesting enables intermittently powered devices to compute without built-in power. But frequent power failures, combined with nonvolatile memory intended to protect computational state, introduce strange control flow that turns sequential code into unwieldy concurrent code: programs must grapple with their own state from previous interrupted runs. This paper describes the broken time machine problem for these devices and outlines potential solutions from the perspective of safe concurrent programming.

5834868725ff05a97b01591a	ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization's design structure. The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resources, and tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. ORA contains over 100 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect.
5834868625ff05a97b012726	Public opinion researchers and other social scientists are accus-tomed to interviewing a respondent and then once they have the data, forgetting about what effect such an interview might have upon the respondent. For most respondents, however, an interview is a very unusual event and could have important consequences for his or her future attitudes and behavior. Yet, so far as we know, only one social scientist has examined the behavior of respondents after being interviewed.
5834868625ff05a97b012dff	Three formulations for the problem of an elastica adhering to a rigid surface are discussed and compared. These include stationary principles, the surface integral of Eshelby's energy-momentum tensor, and the material (configurational) force balance. The configuration at static equilibrium is predicted in closed form for a pair of structures that arise in nano-and microscale applications.
5834868725ff05a97b0158d8	Rosebud is a user-interface prototype which elicits storytelling by child users though interaction with a computationally-augmented physical artifact. In particular, Rosebud links children's stories to their toys, such that toy and computer augment one another. The toy engages children in a familiar mode of interaction, while the computer makes a previously passive object active. The children are able to write, edit, collaborate, and share their stories, activities which have particular attraction for female users.
5834868625ff05a97b011e6d	A robot's appearance and behavior provide cues to the robot's abilities and propensities. We hypothesize that an appropriate match between a robot's social cues and its task will improve people's acceptance of and cooperation with the robot. In an experiment, people systematically preferred robots for jobs when the robot's humanlikeness matched the sociability required in those jobs. In two other experiments, people complied more with a robot whose demeanor matched the seriousness of the task.
5834868625ff05a97b012e61	Providing drivers with comprehensive assistance systems has long been a goal for the automotive industry. The challenge is on many fronts, from building sensors, analyzing sensor data, automated understanding of traffic situations and appropriate interaction with the driver. These issues are discussed with the example of a collision warning system for transit buses.
5834868625ff05a97b01277a	Most of the problems reported by the software industry concerning software development can be traced to lack of coordination. Coordination is a key aspect of development, especially when project size and complexity begins to increase. Unfortunately, too much emphasis has been placed on formal communication during coordinating activities. Developers will have to incorporate informal communication to compensate for project uncertainties.
5834868725ff05a97b0144cb	Educators and researchers have long recognized the importance of formative feedback for learning. Formative feedback helps learners understand where they are in a learning process, what the goal is, and how to reach that goal. While experimental and observational research has illuminated many aspects of feedback, modern interactive learning environments provide new tools to understand feedback and its relation to various learning outcomes.
5834868725ff05a97b0141cb	Group communication is inherently a social activity. However, existing protocols for group key establishment often fail to consider important social dynamics. This paper examines the human requirements for wireless group key establishment. We identify seven social and situational factors which impact group formation. Using these factors, we examine the requirements of four common classes of group communications. Each scenario imposes a unique set of requirements on wireless group key establishment.
5834868625ff05a97b012854	As a response to the rise of paparazzi, the expanse of digital cameras and the resulting erosion of privacy, Anti-Paparazzi Fashion devices offer the power to control identity in public. In this paper, we reveal the technologies that allow these devices to be wearable, effective and fashionable, providing an ondemand, always-ready source of identity protection.
5834868625ff05a97b013575	Accurate network traffic classification is an important task. We intend to develop an intelligent classification system by learning the types of service inside a network flow using machine learning techniques. Previous work used Bayesian methods for traffic classification. In this paper we propose a further plan to identify a fine-grained traffic classification scheme through combining a series of techniques.

5834868725ff05a97b0141fc	Bluetooth Simple Pairing and Wi-Fi Protected Setup specify mechanisms for exchanging authentication credentials in wireless networks. Both Simple Pairing and Protected Setup support multiple setup mechanisms, which increases security risks and hurts the user experience. To improve the security and usability of these specifications, we suggest defining a common baseline for hardware features and a consistent, interoperable user experience across devices.
5834868725ff05a97b013756	Speeches given by decision makers within Central Banks are subject to frequent and careful analysis. However, a systematic process for their evaluation has remained elusive. This paper introduces a methodology for a systematic process in the form of a semantic network that can be used to augment existing approaches. The approach suggests a correlation between the new systematic method and public market securities data.
5834868725ff05a97b0151d7	Distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks have emerged as a prevalent way to compromise the availability of networks/servers, which imposed financial losses for e-commerce businesses. Many defenses that mitigate the effect of ongoing DDOS attacks have been proposed. However, none of the defenses have been widely deployed on the Internet infrastructure at this point because of a lack of understanding in the economic incentives inherent in providing the defenses as well as uncertainty in current defenses.
5834868625ff05a97b012379	This paper presents preliminary development of autonomous sensor-guided behaviors for a six-legged dynamical robot (RHex). The behaviors represent the exteroceptive closed-loop locomotion strategies for this system. Simple motion models for RHex are described and used to deploy controllers for inertial straight line locomotion and visual line following. Results are experimentally validated on the robot.
5834868625ff05a97b0123e6	An apparatus for facilitating the implantation of an artificial component in one of a hip joint, a knee joint, a hand and wrist joint, an elbow joint, a shoulder joint, and a foot and ankle joint. The apparatus includes a pre-operative geometric planner and a pre-operative kinematic biomechanical simulator in communication with the pre-operative geometric planner.
5834868725ff05a97b014490	In this library, the COBWEB and COBWEB/3 algorithms are implemented. These systems accept a stream of instances, which are represented as dictionaries of attributes and values (where values can be nominal for COBWEB and either numeric or nominal for COBWEB/3), and learns a concept hierarchy. The resulting hierarchy can be used for clustering and prediction.
5834868725ff05a97b015ccf	We give an algebraic quantifier elimination algorithm for the first-order theory over any given finite field using Gröbner basis methods. The algorithm relies on the strong Nullstellensatz and properties of elimination ideals over finite fields. We analyze the theoretical complexity of the algorithm and show its application in the formal analysis of a biological controller model.
5834868725ff05a97b014c8b	Within-speaker pronunciation variation is a well-known phenomenon; however, attempting to capture and predict a speaker's choice of pronunciations has been mostly overlooked in the field of speech synthesis. We propose a method to utilize acoustic modeling techniques from speech recognition in order to detect a speaker's choice between full and reduced pronunciations.
5834868625ff05a97b012e9d	Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical investigations. However, the gap between dropout's training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis.
5834868625ff05a97b011336	Biomedical information extraction tasks are often more complex and contain uncertainty at each step during problem solving processes. We present an adaptive information extraction framework and demonstrate how to explore uncertainty using feedback integration.
5834868725ff05a97b01432b	This is a preliminary descriptive study of a new form of digital content: 3D-printable designs of physical things. We introduce a new dataset collected from one of the most popular sites for publishing and sharing physical object designs. We describe the data and its properties, and present an interactive visualization to facilitate further exploration of this space.
5834868625ff05a97b013233	Many manipulator operations eliminate uncertainty in the locations and shapes of objects by purely mechanical means. Rather than relying on sensors, or on auxiliary parts-feeding machinery, these operations use the intrinsic mechanics of the task environment to eliminate uncertainty. Effective use of these operations requires that a planner be able to analyze the mechanics of a given task.
5834868725ff05a97b0152df	Project Argus addresses the problem of obtaining novel intelligence from large, constantly incrementing collections of structured data like shipping records, financial transfers, or hospital admission records. Structured data already provides intelligence analysts with a huge amount of important information. The ever-increasing capabilities of techniques to discern structure in currently unstructured data like text, image, and voice ensure that handling structured data will only become more important for intelligence analysis.
5834868725ff05a97b014156	Here we introduce a variety of open-source software projects that are highly relevant to bootstrapping trust. At the time of this writing many interesting software packages are available, including a full Linux distribution and several LiveCDs that facilitate experimentation without modifying anything on one's hard drive. These software packages are an excellent starting place for gaining a deeper understanding of the capabilities of existing hardware and software to bootstrap trust.

5834868625ff05a97b012779	1. As the Internet has changed communication, commerce, and the distribution of information, so too it is changing psychological research. Psychologists can observe new or rare phenomena online and can do research on traditional psychological topics more efficiently, enabling them to expand the scale and scope of their research. Yet these opportunities entail risk both to research quality and to human subjects. Internet research is inherently no more risky than traditional observational, survey, or experimental methods.
5834868625ff05a97b011bf2	The Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University has been conducting work in the area of autonomous mobile robots under DARPA funding. The goals of this work are: to develop core perception technology for the navigation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) in outdoor environment, to develop planning, architecture and systems-building tools for the integration of the core technology in unmanned systems, and to demonstrate autonomous systems for outdoor navigation. Substantial progress has been achieved in all three areas.
5834868625ff05a97b0127ae	Satirical irony is a very important language phenomena. Its recognition is of great importance to sentiment analysis. However, researches on this topic are still quite rare and existing studies have problems such as unclear definition and unclear objects of study. To solve these problems, we first give clear definitions of satirical irony. Then we discuss in what level satirical irony occurs. Finally, we propose some features of satirical irony.
5834868725ff05a97b014408	We present a constraint-based case frame lexicon architecture for bi-directional mapping between a syntactic case frame and a semantic frame. The lexicon uses a semantic sense as the basic unit and employs a multi-tiered constraint structure for the resolution of syntactic information into the appropriate senses and/or idiomatic usage. Valency changing transformations such as morphologically marked passivized or causativized forms are handled via lexical rules that manipulate case frames templates.
5834868725ff05a97b014f00	Today's social-coding tools foreshadow a transformation of the software industry, as it relies increasingly on open libraries, frameworks, and code fragments. Our vision calls for new intelligently transparent services that support rapid development of innovative products while helping developers manage risk and issuing them early warnings of looming failures. Intelligent transparency is enabled by an infrastructure that applies analytics to data from all phases of the life cycle of open source projects, from development to deployment.
5834868625ff05a97b012d72	This paper describes CMU's system for the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (TEDL) task at TAC-KBP 2015. Our system is a unified graph-based approach which is able to do concept disambiguation and entity linking simultaneously, leveraging the ontology built on Freebase. The results show that our system achieves competitive results for Chinese and Spanish.
5834868625ff05a97b012f27	Shared-memory multicore and multiprocessor systems are nondeterministic, which frustrates debugging and complicates testing of multithreaded code, impeding parallel programming's widespread adoption. The authors propose fully deterministic shared-memory multiprocessing that not only enhances debugging by offering repeatability by default, but also improves the quality of testing and the deployment of production code. They show that determinism can be provided with little performance cost on future hardware.
5834868725ff05a97b01381c	In order to find the optimal control of continuous state-space and time reinforcement learning (RL) problems, we approximate the value function (VF) with a particular class of functions called the barycentric interpolators. We establish sufficient conditions under which a RL algorithm converges to the optimal VF, even when we use approximate models of the state dynamics and the reinforcement functions.
5834868625ff05a97b011ed2	Measuring vehicle motion and orientation is very important for not only automated vehicle control but obstacle detection. This paper describes a new approach to measure vehicle motion and orientation, which is essential information for detecting small obstacles with a single CCD camera. This paper also introduces the possibility of measuring road gradient and dips on road surfaces using optical flow.
5834868625ff05a97b012d91	Progress in soft robotics, wearable computing, and programmable matter demands a new class of ultrasoft electronics for tactile control, contact detection, and deformation mapping. This next generation of sensors will remain electrically functional under extreme deformation without influencing the natural mechanics of the host system. Ultrasoft strain and pressure sensing has previously been demonstrated with elastomer sheets (eg. PDMS, silicone rubber) embedded with microchannels of conductive liquid (mercury, eGaIn).
5834868625ff05a97b012f3a	ABSTRACT: The extraction of lip contour features is difficult and computationally expensive. In this paper we explore the desirable alternative of estimating the contour from area features (ie. mouth grey-scale image) directly via a non-linear stochastic mapping technique. Results are presented on our own speaker dependent database to demonstrate this method and explain why it performs better than previous techniques.
5834868725ff05a97b015665	AutoMap is software for computer-assisted Network Text Analysis (NTA). NTA encodes the links among words in a text and constructs a network of the links words. AutoMap subsumes classical Content Analysis by analyzing the existence, frequencies, and covariance of terms and themes.
5834868725ff05a97b01441e	We demonstrate a web-based, languageindependent annotation framework used for manual correction of a large Arabic corpus. Our framework provides intuitive interfaces for annotating text and managing the annotation process. We describe the details of both the annotation and the administration interfaces as well as the back-end engine. We also show how this framework is able to speed up the annotation process by employing automated annotators to fix basic Arabic spelling errors.
5834868625ff05a97b011d98	This paper presents the structure and performance of the newly developed fingerprint imaging system, and the outline of the image processing for the quantification of incipient slip. Incipient slip, that is considered to have direct relation with slip perception, is visualized as distortion of a fingerprint pattern. A force sensor for the contact force measurements are also newly developed. Thus this system enables highly accurate incipient slip and fingertip contact force measurements.
5834868625ff05a97b011d99	This paper describes an online 3D reconstruction system from stereo image sequences to obtain a dense local world model for robot navigation. The proposed method consists of three components: 1) stereo depth map calculation, 2) correspondence calculation in time sequential images by tracking raw image features, 3) 6DOF camera motion estimation by RANSAC and integrate depth map into 3D reconstructed model. We examined and evaluated our method in a motion capture environment for comparison.
5834868725ff05a97b01566e	Radar‐Soar, an artificial organization composed of intelligent agents, is crafted out of multiple interconnected modules—one of each agent, one of the organizational design (structure plus process), and one of the task. Each agent is based on a sophisticated model of cognition, ie, Soar. Using Radar‐Soar we demonstrate how insight into organizational (and so social) behavior can be gained using computational models that take a meso‐approach to organizations.
5834868725ff05a97b014444	This paper summarizes the development process of a wordnet for Turkish as part of the Balkanet project. After discussing the basic method-ological issues that had to be resolved during the course of the project, the paper presents the basic steps of the construction process in chronological order. Two applications using Turkish wordnet are summarized and links to resources for wordnet builders are provided at the end of the paper.
5834868725ff05a97b015cf2	This paper is a survey of several techniques that have proven useful in establishing compatibility among behaviorally similar programs (eg, system upgrades, object sub-and supertypes, system components produced by different vendors, etc.). We give a comparative analysis of the techniques by evaluating their applicability to various aspects of the compatibility problem1.
5834868625ff05a97b012d9f	In this technical document we present a proof on the uniqueness of group sparse coding through the block ACS theorem. Leveraging the original ACS theorem of Hillar and Sommer for sparse coding, we demonstrate a similar uniqueness property holds for the task of group sparse coding.
5834868725ff05a97b014f22	In this note, we prove that the concept class of rank-r decision trees (defined by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler) is contained within the class of r-decision lists (defined by Rivest). Each class if known to be learnable in polynomial time in the PAC model, for constant r. One result of this note, however, is that the simpler algorithm of Rivest can be used for both.
5834868725ff05a97b014f38	We point out that a number of standard sample complexity bounds (VC-dimension, PAC-Bayes, and others) are all related to the number of bits required to communicate the labels given the unlabeled data for a natural communication game. Motivated by this observation, we give a general sample complexity bound based on this game that allows us to unify these different bounds in one common framework.
5834868725ff05a97b015d06	Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with five-year survival rates less than 5% due to rare detection in early stages. Identification of genes that are directly correlated to pancreatic cancer survival is crucial for pancreatic cancer diagnostics and treatment. However, no existing GWAS or transcriptome studies are available for addressing this problem. We apply lasso penalized Cox regression to a transcriptome study to identify genes that are directly related to pancreatic cancer survival.
5834868725ff05a97b014436	Morphological processes in a language can be effectively used to enrich individual wordnets with semantic relations. More importantly, morphological processes in a language can be used to discover less explicit semantic relations in other languages. This will both improve the internal connectivity of individual wordnets and also the overlap across different wordnets. Using morphology to improve the quality of wordnets and to automatically prepare synset glosses are two other possible applications.
5834868625ff05a97b012dd8	We performed compression tests to dense vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) arrays using a home-made mini-loading test platform. Effective spring constants and compressive moduli of the MWCNT arrays are derived from the force-displacement relations. The effective compressive moduli are found to be~ 0.2 MPa independent of nanotube lengths. A simplified continuum mechanics model is developed to explain the experimental observations.
5834868725ff05a97b0144c4	The development of graphical argument models is an active and growing area of research in Artificial Intelligence and Law. The aim is to develop models which may be readily used by legal professionals and novices to produce and parse arguments. If this goal is to be realized it is important to develop models that human reasoners can manipulate and assess consistently. We report on an ongoing study of graph agreement in the context of the LARGO system.
5834868625ff05a97b01338d	Facial expression and head pose are rich sources of information which provide an important communication channel for interaction. A crucial initial step in many a ect sensing, face recognition and human behaviour understanding systems is the estimation of head pose and tracking of facial feature points. The availability of accurate and a ordable depth cameras leads us to explore this new channel for facial tracking.
5834868725ff05a97b015676	In an attempt to systematically address what factors affect organizational performance, we built a dynamic computational framework for examining organizational performance in which organizations are composed of intelligent adaptive agents. Using this framework the user can contrast organizations with different designs, existing in different task environments, and subject to different stresses. We demonstrate the value of this model by examining how training and stress affect organizational performance.
5834868725ff05a97b0144ec	Several models were built recently in the metacognitive level of the students' interaction with Cognitive Tutors, an intelligent tutoring system based on ACT-R theory. After finding suboptimal help-seeking behavior, we built a metacognitive model of desired help-seeking behavior (Aleven et al. in press). In a different Cognitive Tutor, Baker et al.(2004) built a model that identifies misuse of the tutor.
5834868725ff05a97b0138e0	A framework is presented for constructing knowledge-based aids for design problems. In particular, we describe the organization of an interactive knowledge-based consultant for VLSI design (called VEXED¿ an acronym for VLSI expert editor), and a prototype implementation of VEXED. The paper focuses on the principles underlying the design of VEXED, and on several lessons and research issues that have arisen from implementing and experimenting with this prototype.
5834868625ff05a97b012f56	Recently, the use of chromatic segmentation has come very much into vogue for mouth tracking. Our recent work has endeavored to show under what conditions and representations chromatic segmentation works. Results are presented showing that, for some members of the population, chromatic segmentation does not work satisfactorily, irrespective of recording conditions. A suitability metric is proposed that can give a quantitative measure on how well chromatic mouth tracking will work for a given subject.
5834868725ff05a97b014fa4	As more computers have incorporated some form of parallelism, the emphasis in algorithm design has shifted from sequential algorithms to parallel algorithms, that is, algorithms in which multiple operations are performed simultaneously. As a consequence, our understanding of parallel algorithms has increased remarkably over the past ten years. The most important developments in the field have occurred in three broad areas: parallel models of computation, parallel algorithmic techniques, and parallel complexity theory.
5834868725ff05a97b013dc1	Early cancer diagnosis and evaluation of cancer progression during treatment are two important factors for clinical therapy. In this study we propose a novel approach which automatically compares the subcellular location of proteins between normal and cancerous tissues in order to identify proteins whose distribution is modified by oncogenesis. This study analyzes 258 proteins in 14 different cancer tissues and their corresponding normal tissues using images provided by the tissue microarray collection of the Human Protein Atlas.
5834868625ff05a97b012fe1	Adding student collaboration to an intelligent tutoring system could leverage the benefits of both approaches. We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.
5834868625ff05a97b011739	Although the accuracy and robustness of sketch recognizers have been steadily improving, there are still many issues involved in using them in applications.

5834868725ff05a97b01597f	This paper presents our system and results for the Feed Distillation task in the Blog track at TREC 2007. Our experiments focus on two dimensions of the task:(1) a large-document model (feed retrieval) vs. a small-document model (entry or post retrieval) and (2) a novel query expansion method using the link structure and link text found within Wikipedia.
5834868725ff05a97b014fbc	Many important phenomena in science and engineering, including our motivating problem of microstructural blood flow, can be modeled as flows with dynamic interfaces. The major challenge faced in simulating such flows is resolving the interfacial motion. Lagrangian methods are ideally suited for such problems, since interfaces are naturally represented and propagated. However, the material description of motion results in dynamic meshes, which become hopelessly distorted unless they are regularly regenerated.
5834868725ff05a97b013afd	The goal of the SEEUP 2009 workshop is to discuss end-user programming with a specific focus on the software engineering that is required to make it a more disciplined process, while still hiding the complexities of greater discipline from the end user. The main topic is the understanding of the problems and needs of the real end users of end-user programming and a discussion of the software engineering and supporting technology that would have to be in place to address these problems and needs.
5834868625ff05a97b011755	One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that facilitates dynamic delivery of service profiles to a client. During operation, the system performs a discovery operation to allow the client to discover new services on a network. If a new service is discovered for which the client does not possess a service profile, the client to obtains the service profile from the new service and subsequently installs it, thereby enabling the client to interact with the new service.
5834868625ff05a97b0130e0	This paper describes an introductory robotics course where the Lego Mindstorms NXT kits are used as the robot platform. The aims, scope, and the contents of the course are presented and the design of the laboratory sessions is explained in detail. Finally, the term project of the course, for which the students were expected to design an autonomous robot to navigate in a maze to reach its goal and climb up a pole to complete the task, is elaborated from the students' point of view.
5834868625ff05a97b0130e6	Multi-robot systems become more popular since a team of relatively simple robots may achieve a complex goal more effectively than a single complex robot if a proper design paradigm is used. Two main advantages of multi-robot systems over single robot systems are their robustness and higher performance due to parallel execution. Multi-robot systems have a wide application area from mine sweeping to planetary exploration and from soccer playing to search and rescue operations in disaster areas.
5834868725ff05a97b013b46	The aim of this paper is to describe the implementation of a lowpower, low-cost 16-bit RISC microcontroller that will act as the core of a stand-alone security system. The controller is designed to provide moderate-high security at very low cost and to be able to operate independent of a database. It is designed using 1.5-µm SCMOS process from MOSIS and operates at a frequency of 12.5 MHz.
5834868625ff05a97b012adb	Background Probabilistic models have gained widespread acceptance in the systems biology community as a useful way to represent complex biological systems. Such models are developed using existing knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the system, experimental observations, and inferences drawn from statistical analysis of empirical data. A key bottleneck in building such models is that some system variables cannot be measured experimentally. These variables are incorporated into the model as numerical parameters.

5834868625ff05a97b012ae6	Multi-dimensional (or multi-way) analysis have evinced considerable interest within the datamining community. In this technical report, we describe the development and implementation of a python based library to perform multi-way analysis. Our results show that the python implementation runs comparable to the MATLAB implementation. The implementation is available from http://pytensor. googlecode. com/.
5834868625ff05a97b012aef	Exhaustive state space exploration based verification of embedded system designs remains a challenge despite three decades of active research into Model Checking. On the other hand, simulation based verification of even critical embedded system designs is often subject to financial budget considerations in practice. In this paper, we suggest an algorithm that minimizes the overall cost of producing an embedded system including the cost of testing the embedded system and expected losses from an incompletely tested design.

5834868725ff05a97b014f78	In this survey, we review work in machine learning on methods for handling data sets containing large amounts of irrelevant information. We focus on two key issues: the problem of selecting relevant features, and the problem of selecting relevant examples. We describe the advances that have been made on these topics in both empirical and theoretical work in machine learning, and we present a general framework that we use to compare different methods. We close with some challenges for future work in this area.

The hierarchical roadmap can almost completely cover the traversable areas in the environment. The mobile robot path planner...
5834868625ff05a97b011fa2	Metaprogramming (MP) is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data or that do part of the work during compile time that is otherwise done at run time. In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually.
5834868625ff05a97b013451	Learning Apprentice Systems are interactive knowledge-based consultant systems that directly confront the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck by learning from their users. This paper discusses the notion of Learning Apprentice Systems in general, and summarizes our efforts to develop a specific Learning Apprentice in the domain of VLSI design.
5834868725ff05a97b0157cc	Automatic shadow detection is a very important pre-processing step for many remote sensing applications, particularly for images acquired with high spatial resolution. In complex urban environments, shadows may occupy a significant portion of the image. Ignoring these regions would lead to errors in various applications, such as atmospheric correction and classification. To better understand the radiative impact of shadows, a physical study was conducted through the simulation of a synthetic urban canyon scene.

Intelligent transparency is enabled by an infrastructure that applies analytics to data from all phases of the life cycle of open source projects, from development to deployment.
5834868725ff05a97b013a08	This paper describes some of the results from the project entitled “New Parameterization for Emotional Speech Synthesis” held at the Summer 2011 JHU CLSP workshop. We describe experiments on how to use articulatory features as a meaningful intermediate representation for speech synthesis. This parameterization not only allows us to reproduce natural sounding speech but also allows us to generate stylistically varying speech.
5834868725ff05a97b014d2a	Detecting dyslexia is crucial so that people who have dyslexia can receive training to avoid associated high rates of academic failure. In this paper we present Dytective, a game designed to detect dyslexia. The results of a within-subjects experiment with 40 children (20 with dyslexia) show significant differences between groups who played Dytective. These differences suggest that Dytective could be used to help identify those likely to have dyslexia.
5834868725ff05a97b014d54	A system and method for automatically generating exploits, such as exploits for target code, is described. In some implementations, the system received binary code and/or source code of a software applications, finds one or more exploitable bugs within the software application, and automatically generates exploits for the exploitable bugs.

5834868625ff05a97b011f32	The Internet has impelled scholars to expand their views of organization. In 2005, Organization Studies called for papers about online communities that would stretch the field of organization studies. The articles in this special issue use empirical research and theory to re-examine fundamental questions of organizational boundaries, community, and member motivation.
5834868625ff05a97b01179a	Industrial Sawyer motor technology has existed for nearly three decades, traditionally being operated as open-loop positioners. Such systems can attain micron level motion resolution and open-loop repeatability of 10/spl mu/m. This paper outlines a optical sensing technique for Sawyer motors which is capable of sub-micron resolution. Such a sensor can easily be integrated into a motor enabling closed-loop control and sub-micron repeatability.
5834868625ff05a97b01228d	For a scalar random-effect variance, Browne and Draper (2005) have found that the uniform prior works well. It would be valuable to know more about the vector case, in which a second-stage prior on the random effects variance matrix ${\\bf D} $ is needed. We suggest consideration of an inverse Wishart prior for ${\\bf D} $ where the scale matrix is determined from the first-stage variance.
5834868725ff05a97b014580	Injection vulnerabilities have topped rankings of the most critical web application vulnerabilities for several years [1, 2]. They can occur anywhere where user input may be erroneously executed as code. The injected input is typically aimed at gaining unauthorized access to the system or to private information within it, corrupting the system's data, or disturbing system availability. Injection vulnerabilities are tedious and difficult to prevent.
5834868725ff05a97b01458c	Software frameworks contain many internal constraints which plugins cannot break. These constraints are relative to the context of the plugin, and they can involve multiple framework objects. This work creates a lightweight mechanism specifying semantic constraints on the framework and checking plugins against this specification.
5834868725ff05a97b0157e5	Objective. A traditional goal of neural recording with extracellular electrodes is to isolate action potential waveforms of an individual neuron. Recently, in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), it has been recognized that threshold crossing events of the voltage waveform also convey rich information. To date, the threshold for detecting threshold crossings has been selected to preserve single-neuron isolation. However, the optimal threshold for single-neuron identification is not necessarily the optimal threshold for information extraction.
5834868725ff05a97b0157e6	With the demand for telecommunications bandwidth increasing every year, much research and development is going into the devices necessary to expand a fiber's information carrying capacity. One method of performing this task, using wavelength division multiplexing, is already being implemented on quite a broad scale. Naturally, this approach requires sources, detectors, and filters which can be used to pick precisely the proper wavelength, and so the demand for these devices continues to increase at a rapid rate.
5834868725ff05a97b0157eb	To successfully guide limb movements, the brain takes in sensory information about the limb, internally tracks the state of the limb, and produces appropriate motor commands. It is widely believed that this process uses an internal model, which describes our prior beliefs about how the limb responds to motor commands. Here, we leveraged a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus monkeys and novel statistical analyses of neural population activity to gain insight into moment-by-moment internal model computations.
5834868625ff05a97b011fee	SugarJ is a Java-based programming language that provides extensible surface syntax, static analyses, and IDE support. SugarJ extensions are organized as libraries; conventional import statements suffice to activate and compose language extensions. We illustrate how programmers can use SugarJ to modularly extend Java's syntax, semantic analyses and IDE support.
5834868725ff05a97b0145a5	We consider the task of generating transliterated word forms. To allow for a wide range of interacting features, we use a conditional random field (CRF) sequence labeling model. We then present two innovations: a training objective that optimizes toward any of a set of possible correct labels (since more than one transliteration is often possible for a particular input), and a k-best reranking stage to incorporate nonlocal features. This paper presents results on the Arabic-English transliteration task of the NEWS 2012 workshop.
5834868725ff05a97b013b6f	“Floor control” is the protocol which determines which user has control and how to take turns when multiple people share a limited resource such as a single cursor in a synchronous task. First, we provide a new analysis and classification of floor control mechanisms. We then studied eight collaborative conditions in a highly-collaborative computer-based task, where all the subjects were colocated. We studied doing the task without a computer, compared to seven techniques where each user had an input device.
5834868725ff05a97b015047	This work presents a reliable and efficient method for building limited domain speech synthesis voices. By constructing databases close to the targeted domain of the speech application, unit selection synthesis techniques can be used to reliably give very high quality synthesis within domain. In addition to a high quality result we include the techniques and processes required to build such voices often allowing new voices in limited but quite complex domains such as dialog systems to be created in under a week.
5834868725ff05a97b013aae	Interactions is a timely new quarterly magazine of applied human-computer interaction (as it influences system, hardware and software design). It will provide practicing members of the user interface, software, and systems design/development communities with access to the leading practices in the computer-human interface field. The magazine provides timely and useful information about the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive systems and user interface tools, techniques, and products.
5834868725ff05a97b013ac3	Power wheelchair joysticks have been used to control a mouse cursor on desktop computers, but they offer no integrated text entry solution, confining users to point-and-click or point-and-dwell with on-screen keyboards. But on-screen keyboards reduce useful screen real-estate, exacerbate the need for frequent window management, and impose a second focus of attention. By contrast, we present two integrated gestural text entry methods designed for use from power wheelchairs: one for joysticks and the other for touchpads.
5834868725ff05a97b0158ca	We describe the second installment of the Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE-2), a shared task for the NLG community which took place in 2009--10. We evaluated seven NLG systems by connecting them to 1825 users over the Internet, and report the results of this evaluation in terms of objective and subjective measures.
5834868625ff05a97b0121bd	This report describes the state space model which forms the core technology of an integrated autonomous navigation system incorporating perception, control, and position estimation called RANGER. The high speed local navigation problem is formulated as an optimal control problem in state space. This report concentrates on the trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance and sensor stabilization, aspects of the system. These algorithms form the basis of RANGER's Controller object.
5834868725ff05a97b0145c8	Qatar is a worldwide leader in liquid natural gas (LNG) production and is poised to lead the world in gas-to-liquids (GTL) production with the commissioning of the Pearl GTL facility. Unfortunately, Qatar's gas fields contain non-negligible quantities of corrosive and toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), resulting in the ongoing need for expensive and labor intensive pipe inspection to detect and monitor areas of corrosion. Such inspection is critical to plant integrity, worker safety, and to ensure the economic productivity of the facility.
5834868725ff05a97b0158d7	Narrative might well be considered a solution to a problem of general human concern, namely, the problem of how to translate knowing into telling, the problem of fashioning human experience into a form as-similable to structures of meaning that are generally human rather than culture-speciﬁc.
5834868625ff05a97b012e14	This article presents perception and navigation systems for a family of autonomous orchard vehicles. The systems are customized to enable safe and reliable driving in modern planting environments. The perception system is based on a global positioning system (GPS)-free sensor suite composed of a twodimensional (2-D) laser scanner, wheel and steering encoders, and algorithms that process the sensor data and output the vehicle's location in the orchard and guidance commands for row following and turning.
5834868725ff05a97b0145e3	Systems, methods, and computer storage media having computer-executable instructions embodied thereon for rewriting queries and labeling word pairs. Queries are received and alternate words are identified for word pairs (ie, query words and alternate words). Word pair links are presented to users and indicators are received based on actions taken by the users. Labels are assigned to the word pairs based on the indicators and communicated to a classifier.
5834868625ff05a97b0121ed	“Transportation into a narrative world” is an experience of cognitive, emotional, and imagery involvement in a narrative. Transportation theory (Green & Brock, 2000, 2002) provides a lens for understanding the concept of media enjoyment. The theory suggests that enjoyment can benefit from the experience of being immersed in a narrative world, as well as from the consequences of that immersion. Consequences implied by transportation theory include connections with characters and self-transformations.
5834868625ff05a97b012444	We present a novel authoring infrastructure1 for accelerating the rate of content creation for coached practice environments. In an initial authoring stage, the tool supports quick authoring of scaffolded problems, drawing upon principles established in prior intelligent tutoring authoring research. However, in contrast to earlier approaches, the result of this stage is a structured template than can be used to generate a multitude of variations on the same problem concept.
5834868725ff05a97b013f35	Computer graphics and computer vision techniques deal with acquiring, interpreting and presenting the rich visual world around us. These are exciting multi-disciplinary fields of research with a wide spectrum of applications that can impact our daily lives. However, most of the computer generated imagery today represents scenes with clear atmospheres, neglecting light scattering effects. Analogously, most computer vision systems have not enjoyed success when deployed in uncontrolled outdoor environments.

5834868625ff05a97b01249c	We present a model–developed using Contextual Inquiry–of how prototype intelligent tutors are deployed into classrooms, focusing on how field technical personnel can serve as vital conduits for information and negotiation between ITS researchers and school personnel such as teachers and principals.
5834868725ff05a97b013c86	This paper presents an overview of the tools provided by KANTOO MT system for controlled source language checking, source text analysis, and terminology management. The steps in each process are described, and screen images are provided to illustrate the system architecture and example tool interfaces.
5834868725ff05a97b014002	An instruction window that can tolerate latencies to DRAM memory is prohibitively complex and power hungry. To avoid having to build such large windows, runahead execution uses otherwise-idle clock cycles to achieve an average 22 percent performance improvement for processors with instruction windows of contemporary sizes. This technique incurs only a small hardware cost and does not significantly increase the processor's complexity.
5834868725ff05a97b01401f	Phase-change may enable continued scaling of main memories, but PCM has higher access latencies, incurs higher power costs, and wears out more quickly than DRAM. This article discusses how to mitigate these limitations through buffer sizing, row caching, write reduction, and wear leveling, to make PCM a viable dream alternative for scalable main memories.
5834868725ff05a97b01504c	In this paper, we describe a statistical approach to both an articulatory-to-acoustic mapping and an acoustic-to-articulatory inversion mapping without using phonetic information. The joint probability density of an articulatory parameter and an acoustic parameter is modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on a parallel acoustic–articulatory speech database. We apply the GMM-based mapping using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, which has been proposed for voice conversion, to the two mappings.
5834868725ff05a97b015063	We present our approach for tackling the iUnit ranking and iUnit summarization subtasks of MobileClick2. We first conduct intent discovery based on latent topic modeling. Our iUnit ranking method exploits the discovered intents and considers the importance of an iUnit in each Web content document. We further develop our iUnit summarization model using the outcome from the iUnit ranking subtask. Our result submitted to the iUnit ranking subtask demonstrates superior performance.
5834868725ff05a97b014ffe	We describe the development of a robust and flexible Thai speech recognizer as integrated into our English-Thai speech-to-speech translation system. We focus on the discussion of the rapid deployment of ASR for Thai under limited time and data resources, including rapid data collection issues, acoustic model bootstrap, and automatic generation of pronunciations. Issues relating to the translation and overall system will be reported elsewhere.
5834868625ff05a97b0134f6	This workshop covers real-time computational techniques for the recognition and interpretation of human affective and social behaviour, and techniques for synthesis of believable social behaviour supporting real-time adaptive human-agent and human-robot interaction in real-world environments.
5834868725ff05a97b015001	The speed with which pronunciation dictionaries can be bootstrapped depends on the efficiency of learning algorithms and on the ordering of words presented to the user. This paper presents an active-learning word selection strategy that is mindful of human limitations. Learning rates approach that of an oracle system that knows the final LTS rule set.
5834868725ff05a97b015004	This paper describes some of the results from the project entitled “New Parameterization for Emotional Speech Synthesis” held at the Summer 2011 JHU CLSP workshop. We describe experiments on how to use articulatory features as a meaningful intermediate representation for speech synthesis. This parameterization not only allows us to reproduce natural sounding speech but also allows us to generate stylistically varying speech.

5834868725ff05a97b015123	Computational analysis is significantly impacting the way groups, teams, organizations, markets, institutions and societies are managed and the way individual, organizational, market, and policy decisions are made and evaluated. Computational analysis is dramatically re-shaping the way we think and reason about organizational design and strategy, commerce, organizational learning, new organizational forms, information technology product development, innovation and diffusion, and adaptation at all levels.
5834868625ff05a97b012c3c	Opening and navigating through doors remains a challenging problem, particularly in cluttered environments and for spring-loaded doors. Passing through doors, especially spring-loaded doors, requires making and breaking contacts with the door and preventing the door from closing while passing through. In this work, we present a planning framework that handles non-spring and spring-loaded doors, in cluttered or confined workspaces, planning the approach to the door, pushing or pulling it open, and passing through.
5834868725ff05a97b015012	This paper discusses the efforts in collecting speech databases for Indian languages–Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. We discuss relevant design considerations in collecting these databases, and demonstrate their usage in speech synthesis. By releasing these speech databases in the public domain without any restrictions for non commercial and commercial purposes, we hope to promote research and developmental activities in building speech synthesis systems in Indian languages.
5834868725ff05a97b015014	This paper describes the latest version of the SOLE concept-to-speech system, which uses linguistic information provided by a natural language generation system to improve the prosody of synthetic speech. We discuss the types of linguistic information that prove most useful and the implications for text-to-speech systems.
5834868725ff05a97b015024	As part of improved support for building unit selection voices, the Festival speech synthesis system now includes two algorithms for automatic labeling of wavefile data. The two methods are based on dynamic time warping and HMM-based acoustic modeling. Our experiments show that DTW is more accurate 70% of the time, but is also more prone to gross labeling errors. HMM modeling exhibits a systematic bias of 15 ms. Combining both methods directs human labelers towards data most likely to be problematic.
5834868725ff05a97b0154c2	The increasing amount of online content motivated the development of multi-document summarization methods. In this work, we explore straightforward approaches to extend single-document summarization methods to multi-document summarization. The proposed methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries, and achieves state of the art results.
5834868725ff05a97b0154cf	By adopting a “first-things-first” approach we overcome a number of challenges inherent in developing NLP Systems for resource-scarce languages. By first gathering the necessary corpora and lexicons we are then enabled to build, for Mapudungun, a spelling-corrector, morphological analyzer, and two Mapudungun-Spanish machine translation systems; and for Quechua, a morphological analyzer as well as a rule-based Quechua-Spanish machine translation system.
5834868725ff05a97b0154d7	Abstract—When astronomers analyze sky images, they need to identify the newly observed celestial objects in the catalog of known objects. We have developed a technique for indexing catalogs, which supports fast retrieval of closely matching catalog objects for every object in new images. It allows processing of a sky image in less than a second, and it scales to catalogs with billions of objects.
5834868725ff05a97b015c90	In this paper we present two studies exploring social and affective responses to political information. We hypothesize that people treat messages from in-group sources differently than they do messages from out-group sources. Evidence from two experiments indicates not only a link between affective reactions and social sharing behavior, but also that subjects treat information from in-group sources differently than they do information from outgroup sources.
5834868625ff05a97b012573	The possibility of leveraging technology to support children's learning in the real world is both appealing and technically challenging. We have been exploring factors in tangible games that may contribute to both learning and enjoyment with an eye toward technological feasibility and scalability. Previous research found that young children learned early physics principles better when interactively predicting and observing experimental comparisons on a physical earthquake table than when seeing a video of the same.

5834868625ff05a97b0135b8	Recent advances in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offer a significant new approach to studying semantic representations in humans by making it possible to directly observe brain activity while people comprehend words and sentences. In this study, we investigate how humans comprehend adjective-noun phrases (eg strong dog) while their neural activity is recorded. Classification analysis shows that the distributed pattern of neural activity contains sufficient signal to decode differences among phrases.

5834868625ff05a97b0130fc	Human behavior is complex, but structured along individual and social lines. Robotic systems interacting with people in uncontrolled environments need capabilities to correctly interpret, predict and respond to human behaviors. This paper discusses the scientific, technological and application challenges that arise from the mutual interaction of robotics and computational human behavior understanding. We supply a short survey of the area to provide a contextual framework and describe the most recent research in this area.
5834868725ff05a97b013e30	This article accompanies a tutorial talk given at the 40th ACM STOC conference. In it, we give a brief introduction to Fourier analysis of boolean functions and then discuss some applications: Arrow's Theorem and other ideas from the theory of Social Choice; the Bonami-Beckner Inequality as an extension of Chernoff/Hoeffding bounds to higher-degree polynomials; and, hardness for approximation algorithms.
5834868625ff05a97b011b6f	A content-based 3D neuroradiologic image retrieval system is being developed at the Robotics Institute of CMU. The special characteristics of this system include: 1) directly dealing with multimodal 3D images (MR/CT); 2) image similarity based on anatomical structures of the human brain; 3) combining both visual and collateral information for indexing and retrieval. A testbed has been implemented for using detected salient visual features for indexing and retrieving 3D images.

5834868725ff05a97b0154df	This paper describes the two Story Link Detection systems Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed, and examines why their performance on the evaluation data was considerably worse than expected while performance on an alternate evaluation set matched the performance on the training data.
5834868725ff05a97b0154e6	This paper presents the CMU submission to the 2008 TREC blog distillation track. Similar to last year's experiments, we evaluate different retrieval models and apply a query expansion method that leverages the link structure in Wikipedia. We also explore using a corpus that combines several different representations of the documents, using both the feed XML and permalink HTML, and apply initial experiments with spam filtering.
5834868625ff05a97b0125f8	The authors describe how France introduced the Minitel information highway network in 1982, and now 80 percent of the French nation's businesses and 20 percent of its citizens use it. Network addresses are equivalent to 800 freephone numbers in the United States, but Minitel still manages to run at a profit.
5834868725ff05a97b0154ea	We are applying machine learning and crowdsourcing to cybersecurity, with the purpose to develop a toolkit for detection of complex cyber threats, which are often undetectable by traditional tools. It will serve as an “extra layer of armor” that supplements the standard defenses. The initial results include (1) an architecture for sharing security warnings among users and (2) machine learning techniques for identifying malicious websites. The public release of the developed system is available at http://cyberpsa. com.
5834868625ff05a97b0125fa	In modern crowdsourcing markets, requesters face the challenge of training and managing large transient workforces. Requesters can hire peer workers to review others' work, but the value may be marginal, especially if the reviewers lack requisite knowledge. Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task domain by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion.
5834868725ff05a97b0154f8	We evaluate the feasibility of applying currently available research tools to the problem of cross lingual QA. We establish a task baseline by combining a cross lingual IR system with a monolingual QA system in a very short amount of time. A higher precision strategy involves applying the monolingual QA system to an automatically translated question, assumed to be correct. A higher coverage strategy consists of a term weighted proximity measure with varied query expansion, tuned for each individual question type.
5834868725ff05a97b015544	Formal Verification is a “hot topic” for the user and vendor community. It has moved from the research community to the industrial domain in a very short time. Everyone wants to know more about how effective the techniques are. This experienced user panel will attempt to address your concerns in an open and frank way. They will give their personal opinions and not the commercial hype that so often heralds a new era.
5834868725ff05a97b013e96	Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation systems produce semantically accurate translations, but typically require massive knowledge acquisition. This paper describes KANT, a system that reduces this requirement to produce practical, scalable, and accurate KBMT applications. First, the set of requirements is discussed, then the full KANT architecture is illustrated, and finally results from a fully implemented prototype are presented.
5834868625ff05a97b01201d	At the beginning of this book, in Example 1.1 (p. 3), we described the activity of a neuron recorded from the supplementary eye field. Interpreting Fig. 1.1 we said that, toward the end of each trial, the neuron fired more rapidly under one experimental condition than under the other.
5834868625ff05a97b012021	Multiple linear regression is a powerful method of exploring relationships between a response Y and a set of potential explanatory variables x_1, ..., x_p, but it has an obvious limitation: it assumes the predictive relationship is, on average, linear. In addition, in its standard form it assumes that the noise contributions are homogeneous and follow, roughly, a normal distribution.

5834868625ff05a97b012032	We observed that ensembles of VTA neurons encode information about ongoing behavior in real-time. As rats executed varying numbers of actions to obtain the same reward, the firing rates of different neurons were preferentially tuned to low, medium, or high numbered bins of actions, allowing information about ongoing behavior to be decoded from the ensemble activity. This ensemble code could be used to organize and sustain behavioral responses.
5834868725ff05a97b014e50	Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a leading algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium in large zero-sum imperfect-information games. CFR is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly traverses the game tree, updating regrets at each information set. We introduce an improvement to CFR that prunes any path of play in the tree, and its descendants, that has negative regret. It revisits that sequence at the earliest subsequent CFR iteration where the regret could have become positive, had that path been explored on every iteration.
5834868725ff05a97b015cac	Until recently, collecting network data of any size was a challenge and limited much of the research to analyzing relatively small networks (less than 1000 nodes). Many of our analytic tools worked fine on networks of this size. Now, however, with the help of new information technologies, we find ourselves having access to very large data sets, perhaps on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes to even billions of nodes. This large size has outstripped our ability to perform even rudimentary analysis on the networks as a whole.
5834868725ff05a97b013c77	This paper describes a prototype system which captures semantic knowledge from domain text using controlled language. The KANTOO system is used to analyze input sentences from college-level science textbooks, producing sentence-level meaning representations (interlingua). The interlingua expressions are mapped into F-logic statements, which are be stored in a separate knowledge base to support reasoning in the domain.
5834868625ff05a97b011956	We propose a novel approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on incremental smoothing, that is suitable for real-time applications in large-scale environments. The main advantages over filter-based algorithms are that we solve the full SLAM problem without the need for any approximations, and that we do not suffer from linearization errors. We achieve efficiency by updating the square-root information matrix, a factored version of the naturally sparse smoothing information matrix.
5834868625ff05a97b01309e	We propose a framework for assessing the sustainability of interactive technologies. Our goal is to initiate steps towards a common standard of measurement for sustainability in the HCI community. This could help motivate green competition, raise consumer awareness, and acknowledge environmental leadership. In this paper we summarize our methodology, our results, and discuss how the framework can be integrated for testing within the HCI community.

5834868725ff05a97b015562	The logic of Counters, Lambdas, and Uninterpreted functions (CLU) is a subset of first-order logic satisfying the twin properties that 1) the validity of a CLU formula can be decided by generating a Boolean formula and using a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) checker to show the formula is unsatisfiable, and 2) it has sufficient expressive power to construct models of a variety of interesting software and hardware systems. We describe this logic and show its modeling capabilities.
5834868725ff05a97b0155b8	Concurrent traces are sequences of computational steps where independent steps can be permuted and executed in any order. We study the problem of matching on concurrent traces. We outline a sound and complete algorithm for matching traces with one variable standing for an unknown subtrace.
5834868625ff05a97b0127cd	Current technology is more than capable of providing a secure authentication process, but users are limited in their ability to remember difficult passwords or make judgments about security. In this thesis, both of these problems were tackled in the design of a new picture-password system. Studies in computer security, password usability, and cognitive psychology were referenced throughout the design process.
5834868725ff05a97b0155d1	Rapport has been identified as an important function of human interaction to increase task performances. In this paper we leverage existing literature and a corpus of peer tutoring data to develop a framework able to explain how humans in dyadic interactions build, maintain, and break rapport through the use of specific conversational strategies that function to fulfil specific social goals, and that are instantiated in particular verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
5834868625ff05a97b013574	Many classification algorithms suffer from a lack of human interpretability. Using such classifiers to solve real world problems often requires blind faith in the given model. In this paper we present a novel approach to classification that takes into account interpretability and visualization of the results. We attempt to efficiently discover the most relevant snapshot of the data, in the form of a two-dimensional scatter plot with easily understandable axes. We then use this plot as the basis for a classification algorithm.
5834868725ff05a97b014588	Relating software architecture to implementation is essential for effective software development and evolution. However, significant gaps exit between abstract architecture models and the more concrete models supported by implementation tools, making it difficult to ensure that an architecture and implementation are consistent.
5834868725ff05a97b013db4	Fluorescence microscopy is growing dramatically both in terms of technical capabilities and the volume of images generated. Online repositories have been created to provide public access to images and opportunities for joint research for many scientists 1. This has reintroduced challenges faced when sequence and structure databases were being established: developing fast and effective means of searching for records (images) either by context (such as which protein is labeled) or content (such as which pattern it displays).
5834868625ff05a97b011c75	Face alignment is a computer vision technology for identifying the geometric structure of human faces in digital images. Given the location and size of a face, it automatically determines the shape of the face components such as eyes and nose. A face alignment program typically operates by iteratively adjusting a deformable model, which encodes the prior knowledge of face shape or appearance, to take into account the low-level image evidences and find the face that is present in the image.
5834868625ff05a97b012802	Content creation is a large component of the cost of creating educational software. Estimates are that approximately 200 hours of development time are required for every hour of instruction. We present an authoring tool designed to reduce this cost as it helps to refine and maintain content. The ASSISTment Builder is a tool designed to effectively create, edit, test, and deploy tutor content. The Web-based interface simplifies the process of tutor construction to allow users with little or no programming experience to develop content.
5834868625ff05a97b011c83	A motor driven vehicle for traversing the interior of a pipe or conduit accommodates itself to variations in the interior contour of the pipe and automatically positions itself on the longest axis of any cross section of the pipe. It comprises a pair of two-wheeled trucks each pivotally connected to an end of a stretcher member which urges the trucks away from each other against diametrically opposite paths of travel on the pipe wall. Each truck has a driving wheel and a swivelling wheel, the driving wheels being diagonally opposite each other.
5834868725ff05a97b0155f7	We describe an implemented system which automatically generates and animates conversations between multiple human-like agents with appropriate and synchronized speech, intonation, facial expressions, and hand gestures. Conversations are created by a dialogue planner that produces the text as well as the intonation of the utterances. The speaker/listener relationship, the text, and the intonation in turn drive facial expressions, lip motions, eye gaze, head motion, and arm gesture generators.
5834868625ff05a97b012109	A recent study by Festinger and Maccoby (1964) demonstrated that distraction raises the effectiveness of a communication. This effect may obtain because the distraction interferes with (subvocal) counter-arguing or because the distraction requires more effort to listen and thus arouses dissonance. The present experiment was designed to test these alternative hypotheses, S s were exposed to 4 counter-attitudinal communications. Interference during the communication and credibility of the communicator were orthogonally manipulated.
5834868725ff05a97b013cc0	This panel discusses what demonstrational interfaces are, how they can be used, and when and whether they will become more popular. For more information on demonstrational interfaces, you might refer to survey articles [4, 5], or the three papers in this conference on demonstrational interfaces (by Cypher, Stasko, and Myers). Some other references are listed below.
5834868725ff05a97b014eb7	In this paper, we prove almost tight bounds on the size of sound monotone switching networks accepting permutations sets of directed trees. This roughly corresponds to proving almost tight bounds bounds on the monotone memory efficiency of the directed ST-connectivity problem for the special case in which the input graph is guaranteed to have no path from s to t or be isomorphic to a specific directed tree.
5834868725ff05a97b013f78	Power wheelchair joysticks have been used to control a mouse cursor on desktop computers, but they offer no integrated text entry solution, confining users to point-and-click or point-and-dwell with on-screen keyboards. But on-screen keyboards reduce useful screen real-estate, exacerbate the need for frequent window management, and impose a second focus of attention. By contrast, we present two integrated gestural text entry methods designed for use from power wheelchairs: one for joysticks and the other for touchpads.
5834868625ff05a97b011cac	Using known camera motion to estimate depth from image sequences is an important problem in robot vision. Many applications of depth from motion, including navigation and manipulation, require algorithms that can estimate depth in an on-line, incremental fashion. This requires a representation that records the uncertainty in depth estimates and a mechanism that integrates new measurements with existing depth estimates to reduce the uncertainty over time. Kalman filtering provides this mechanism.

5834868725ff05a97b015620	Long before children receive formal instruction in reading and writing, they participate in a world filled with language. Research in emergent literacy emphasizes the importance of these early experiences with oral and written language as a foundation for later literacy.
5834868625ff05a97b011cdc	An urban operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) demands a high level of autonomy for tasks presented in a cluttered environment. While fixed-wing UAVs have been well suited for long-endurance missions at a high altitude, their navigation inside an urban area brings more challenges in motion planning and control. The inability to hover and low agility in motion cause more difficulties on planning a feasible path in a compact region, and a limited payload allows only low-grade sensors for state estimation and control.
5834868625ff05a97b011ced	Abstract—Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are blood-forming stem cells that give rise to all blood cell types and are routinely used in therapies today. However, HSCs have a limited capability to expand ex vivo. This paper presents an automated tracking method that will facilitate the study and expansion of HSCs by monitoring the behavior of the cells in vitro under serum-free media conditions using phase contrast microscopy. The proposed method exploits a data-association approach that consists of detection and tracking modules.
5834868725ff05a97b015682	AutoMap is an advanced text mining system. It operates in 4 modes. First, it can do classical content analysis; ie concepts and their frequency. Second, it extracts the semantic network; ie concepts and their relation to each other. Third, it cross classifies the concepts into their ontological categories such as agents and locations which results in meta-network. This includes, eg the social network. Fourth, it utilizes post processing to infer various aspects of sentiment.
5834868725ff05a97b0143ad	We describe a system for scheduling a conference based on incomplete information about available resources and scheduling constraints. We explain the representation of uncertain knowledge, describe a local-search algorithm for generating near-optimal schedules, and give empirical results of automated scheduling under uncertainty.
5834868725ff05a97b015413	In this paper we present a new data structure for representing Boolean functions and an associated set of manipulation algorithms. Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee and Akers, but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation.
5834868725ff05a97b0143fe	We present a short survey and exposition of some of the important aspects of Turkish that have proven challenging for natural language processing. Most of the challenges stem from the complex morphology of Turkish and how morphology interacts with syntax. We also provide a short overview of the major tools and resources developed for Turkish natural language processing over the last two decades.
5834868625ff05a97b011d82	This paper presents the principle, structure and performance of a newly developed MR-compatible force sensor. It employs a new optical micrometry that enables highly accurate and highly sensitive displacement measurement. The sensor accuracy is better than 1.0%, and the maximum displacement of the detector is about 10 μm for a range of the applied force from 0 to 6 N.
5834868725ff05a97b015032	Currently, speech synthesizers are controlled by a multitude of proprietary tag sets. These tag sets vary substantially across synthesizers and are an inhibitor to the adoption of speech synthesis technology by developers. SABLE is an XML/SGML-based markup scheme for text-to-speech synthesis, developed to address the need for a common TTS control paradigm. This paper presents an overview of the SABLE v0. 2 specification, and provides links to websites with further information on SABLE.
5834868725ff05a97b013fad	Creativity support tools is a research topic with high risk but potentially very high payoff. The goal is to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower users to be not only more productive but also more innovative. Potential users include software and other engineers, diverse scientists, product and graphic designers, architects, educators, students, and many others. Enhanced interfaces could enable more effective searching of intellectual resources, improved collaboration among teams, and more rapid discovery processes.
5834868725ff05a97b014162	Forwarding accountability mechanisms pinpoint the sending/forwarding properties of traffic to the entities that send and forward the traffic along a path. In this paper, we take flooding attacks as a use case and describe a proposal to hold senders accountable for the sending rates of their flows. Furthermore, we describe the corresponding challenges, potential solutions, and briefly present the literature in the area of forwarding accountability.
5834868725ff05a97b014364	This article presents a new approach to designing brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) that explicitly accounts for both the uncertainty of neural signals and the important role of sensory feedback. This approach views a BCI as the means by which users communicate intent to an external device and models intent as a string in an ordered symbolic language. This abstraction allows the problem of designing a BCI to be reformulated as the problem of designing a reliable communication protocol using tools from feedback information theory.
5834868725ff05a97b01530a	AI research at CMU is closely integrated with other activities in the Computer Science Department, and to a major degree with ongoing research in the Psychology Department. Although there are over 50 faculty, staff and graduate students involved in various aspects of AI research, there is no administratively (or physically) separate AI laboratory. To underscore the interdisciplinary nature of our AI research, a significant fraction of the projects listed below are joint ventures between computer science and psychology.
5834868725ff05a97b01530c	A number of projects at the Carnegie-Mellon University Computer Science Department address issues in Natural Language Processing. Since several of these projects share rescarchers and a similar view of the world, we have listed them in a single summary. Our general interests are in robust man-machine interfaces and the modelling of human dialogs.
5834868625ff05a97b011ddf	The complete set of measurements that could ever be used by a stereo algorithm is the plenoptic function or light-field. We give a concise characterization of when the light-field of a Lambertian scene uniquely determines its shape, and, conversely, when stereo is inherently ambiguous. We show that stereo computed from the complete light-field is ambiguous if and only if the scene is radiating light of a constant intensity (and color) over an extended region.
5834868625ff05a97b011de2	Abstract—The goal of the CMU Planetary Rover project is to prototype an autonomous mobile robot for planetary exploration. We have constructed a six-legged walking robot, called the Ambler, that features orthogonal legs, an overlapping gait, and a scanning laser rangeﬁnder to model terrain. To enable the Ambler to walk over rugged terrain, we have combined perception, planning, and real-time control into a comprehensive robotic system.
5834868725ff05a97b0156a5	Since subsentential alignment is critically important to the translation quality of an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system which operates by finding and combining phrase-level matches against the training examples, we recently decided to develop a new alignment algorithm for the purpose of improving the EBMT system's performance. Unlike most algorithms in the literature, this new Symmetric Probabilistic Alignment (SPA) algorithm treats the source and target languages in a symmetric fashion.
5834868725ff05a97b0156a6	We present initial work on a general-purpose system for the analysis of incomplete and uncertain data, integrated with Excel. We explain the representation of main types of uncertainty, and outline tools for the analysis of uncertain data and planning of additional data collection.
5834868725ff05a97b0156aa	We describe the representation of uncertain knowledge in a conference-scheduling system, which may include incomplete information about available resources, conference events, and scheduling constraints. We then explain the use of this incomplete knowledge in the evaluation of schedule quality.
5834868625ff05a97b011df8	An array of light sources transmit a series of light beams onto an object and the reflected light beams are focussed on a light responsive transducer. The output signals of the transducer are processed to determine the location and orientation of the object. The location and orientation information in turn is available to control the operation of a tool or manipulator relative to the object.
5834868725ff05a97b0156ab	We consider the task of scheduling a conference based on incomplete data about available resource and scheduling constraints, and describe a procedure for automated elicitation of additional data. This procedure is part of an interactive system for scheduling under uncertainty, which identifies critical missing information, generates related questions to the human administrator, and uses answers to improve the schedule.
5834868725ff05a97b015c24	Two quantitative classifiers for assigning attachment status from infant interactive behavior ratings were evaluated. One classifier included crying, agreed an average of 83% with trained coders, but over-classified infants as secure. The second classifier excluded crying, achieved an 86% agreement rate, and reproduced original distributions.
5834868625ff05a97b0129e2	We describe a system which enhances the experience of museum visits by providing users with language-technology-based information retrieval capabilities. The system consists of a cross-lingual search engine, augmented by state of the art semantic expansion technology, specifically designed for the domain of the museum (history and archaeology of Israel). We discuss the technology incorporated in the system, its adaptation to the specific domain and its contribution to cultural heritage appreciation.
5834868725ff05a97b0156b6	This paper analyzes principles of human conversation based on the conversational goals of the participants. Several conversational rules are proposed that seem crucial to the process of interpreting and generating conversations. These rules, as well as other aspects of the conversation process, are embodied in MICS, a computer program that generates one side of a conversation. The process model underlying MICS, and some illustrative output, are presented.
5834868725ff05a97b0156b7	We describe a system for scheduling a conference based on incomplete information about available resources and scheduling constraints.

5834868625ff05a97b0129e9	This paper describes our submissions, cmu-heafield-combo, to the ten tracks of the 2011 Workshop on Machine Translation's system combination task. We show how the combination scheme operates by flexibly aligning system outputs then searching a space constructed from the alignments. Humans judged our combination the best on eight of ten tracks.
5834868725ff05a97b0141a0	Log-based PKI enhancements propose to improve the current TLS PKI by creating public logs to monitor CA operations, thus providing transparency and accountability. In this paper we take the first steps in studying the deployment process of log-based PKI enhancements in two ways. First, we model the influences that parties in the PKI have to incentivize one another to deploy a PKI enhancement, and determine that potential PKI enhancements should focus their initial efforts on convincing browser vendors to deploy.
5834868725ff05a97b015340	Tax noncompliance is socially harmful, as it can reduce revenues, distort labor markets, and undermine state stability by feeding perceptions of cheating and fraud. Reducing noncompliance can be facilitated if one understands the basis for that noncompliance. Kinsey (1984) defined noncompliance with tax laws as the “failure, intentional or unintentional, of taxpayers to meet their tax obligation.” Estimates of errors place the number of returns containing either an intentional or inadvertent error, or both, above 50 percent.
5834868625ff05a97b013277	Individuals could drastically reduce their carbon footprint by changing daily behaviors to more sustainable practices. In order for this change to occur, individuals must be made aware of their impact and must be provided with an incentive to change their consumption patterns. In this paper we provide a literature review of the current research in the areas of energy feedback, social psychology, and social visualization to determine functionality that is important in a computer-based feedback system to motivate users.
5834868725ff05a97b01534f	Numerous measures of organizational structure have been developed. The goal is to develop a small meaningful and predictive set. Work in this area, however, has been hampered by a lack of a standard categorization schema. Such a schema is presented herein. This schema is based on the recognition that many aspects of organizational structures can be represented as graphs.
5834868625ff05a97b01327b	This paper describes initial work on the Domisilica project at Georgia Tech. We are exploring the dual augmentation of physical and virtual worlds in Domisilica and applying this novel concept to support home life beyond the boundaries of the actual house. We will demonstrate the concepts of dual augmentation through one particular appliance, CyberFridge, which serves as an inventory management and communications link between physical and virtual worlds.
5834868725ff05a97b0141f8	We present OASIS, a CPU instruction set extension for externally verifiable initiation, execution, and termination of an isolated execution environment with a trusted computing base consisting solely of the CPU. OASIS leverages the hardware components available on commodity CPUs to achieve a low-cost, low-overhead design.
5834868725ff05a97b0145bc	Given a small polygon S, a big simple polygon B and a positive integer k, it is shown to be NP-hard to determine whether k copies of the small polygon (allowing translation and rotation) can be placed in the big polygon without overlap. Previous NP-hardness results were only known in the case where the big polygon is allowed to be non-simple. A novel reduction from Planar-Circuit-SAT is presented where a small polygon is constructed to encode the entire circuit.
5834868725ff05a97b015041	This paper describes our work with Let's Go, a telephonebased bus schedule information system that has been in use by the Pittsburgh population since March 2005. Results from several studies show that while task success correlates strongly with speech recognition accuracy, other aspects of dialogue such as turn-taking, the set of error recovery strategies, and the initiative style also significantly impact system performance and user behavior.
5834868725ff05a97b01466d	AliasJava is a type annotation system that extends Java to express how data is confined within, passed among, or shared between objects in a software system.

5834868725ff05a97b014ef0	This paper describes a study on the impact of the original signal (text, speech, visual scene, event) of a text pair on the task of both manual and automatic sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition. A corpus of 2,500 annotated sentences in English and French is described, and performance on this corpus is reported for an efficient system combination exploiting a large set of features for paraphrase recognition. A detailed quantified typology of sub-sentential paraphrases found in our corpus types is given.
5834868725ff05a97b014ef3	We present our correction annotation guidelines to create a manually corrected nonnative (L2) Arabic corpus. We develop our approach by extending an L1 large-scale Arabic corpus and its manual corrections, to include manually corrected non-native Arabic learner essays. Our overarching goal is to use the annotated corpus to develop components for automatic detection and correction of language errors that can be used to help Standard Arabic learners (native and non-native) improve the quality of the Arabic text they produce.
5834868725ff05a97b015ce3	We compare two learning algorithms for generating contextual assumptions in automated assume-guarantee reasoning. The CDNF algorithm implicitly represents contextual assumptions by a conjunction of DNF formulae, while the OBDD learning algorithm uses ordered binary decision diagrams as its representation. Using these learning algorithms, the performance of assume-guarantee reasoning is compared with monolithic interpolation-based Model Checking in parametrized hardware test cases.
5834868725ff05a97b014ca6	This paper describes building of the basic components, particularly speech recognition and synthesis, of a speech-tospeech translation system.

5834868725ff05a97b014cb0	This paper describes CMU's entry for the Blizzard Challenge 2007. Our eventual system consisted of a hybrid statistical parameter generation system whose output was used to do acoustic unit selection. After testing a number of varied systems, this system proved the best in our internal tests. This paper also explains some of the limitations we see in our techniques. The CMU system is identified as D in the result charts.

5834868625ff05a97b012ac9	The von Mises model encodes a multivariate circular distribution as an undirected probabilistic graphical model. Presently, the only algorithm for performing inference in the model is Gibbs sampling, which becomes inefficient for large graphs. To address this issue, we introduce an Expectation Propagation based algorithm for performing inference in the von Mises graphical model. Our approach introduces a moment-matching technique for trigonometric functions to approximate the Expectation Propagation messages efficiently.
5834868725ff05a97b014cbc	The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University has, for the past several years, conducted a lab course in building spoken-language dialog systems. In the most recent versions of the course, we have used (commercial) web-based development environments to build systems. This paper describes our experiences and discusses the characteristics of applications that are developed within this framework.
5834868725ff05a97b01398f	In this paper, we propose a stochastic differential equation-based exploration algorithm to enable exploration in three-dimensional indoor environments with a payload constrained micro-aerial vehicle (MAV). We are able to address computation, memory, and sensor limitations by considering only the known occupied space in the current map. We determine regions for further exploration based on the evolution of a stochastic differential equation that simulates the expansion of a system of particles with Newtonian dynamics.
5834868625ff05a97b011f0d	Previous research has shown that design features that support privacy are essential for new technologies looking to gain widespread adoption. As such, privacy-sensitive design will be important for the adoption of social robots, as they could introduce new types of privacy risks to users. In this paper, we report findings from our preliminary study on users' perceptions and attitudes toward privacy in human-robot interaction, based on interviews that we conducted about a workplace social robot.
5834868625ff05a97b012196	A pedestrian tracking system using inertial sensors mounted on both feet is presented. Significant accuracy improvements are demonstrated, compared to single shoe tracking, by using sonar foot-to-foot range measurements to constrain heading drift. A single complementary Kalman filter fuses data from both inertial measurement units and the sonar sensor. The system is composed of commercial and custom hardware. Experimental results collected over long durations and distances are presented.
5834868625ff05a97b013130	Adding student collaboration to an intelligent tutoring system could leverage the beneﬁts of both approaches. We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.
5834868625ff05a97b013133	Computer-mediated environments provide an arena for learning to argue. We investigate to what extent student dyads' online argumentation can be facilitated with collaboration scripts that (1) prompt learners to prepare individually,(2) create conflict, and (3) encourage productive collaboration and argumentation. A process analysis of the chats of the dyads showed that the scripted treatment group used significantly more words and broadened and deepened their discussions significantly more than the unscripted group.
5834868625ff05a97b012db4	This study presents a model of a curved cantilever dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) containing liquid-phase metal electrodes utilizing universal solutions from finite nonlinear elasticity. The DEA comprises a compliant capacitor which has been prestrained some prescribed amount, affixed to a substrate, and bonded to a secondary layer of unstrained bulk elastomer. Upon release of the cured layers, internal stresses cause a bending moment and force the final configuration into a beam with some initial curvature.
5834868725ff05a97b015404	Ten papers were nominated by the Technical Program Committee as DAC Best Paper Candidates. Final decisions will be made after the papers are presented at the conference. The awards for the best paper will be presented at 11: 15am on Thursday, June 17, in Ballroom ABC.
5834868625ff05a97b0132c8	Project Argus addresses the problem of obtaining novel intelligence from large, constantly incrementing collections of structured data like shipping records, financial transfers, or hospital admission records. Structured data already provides intelligence analysts with a huge amount of important information. The ever-increasing capabilities of techniques to discern structure in currently unstructured data like text, image and voice ensure that handling structured data will only become more important for intelligence analysis.
5834868625ff05a97b013321	Scholarships totaling $8000 are given each year by the ACM SIGDA and the IEEE DATC. Awards are presented to graduate engineering and computer science schools based on proposals submitted to the SIGDA and the DATC. Awards are made to a university, who itself selects student (s) for support. The dean or other school representative receives the awards at the General Session.
5834868725ff05a97b01565f	Structural comparison (ie, the simultaneous analysis of multiple structures) is a problem which arises frequently in such diverse arenas as the study of organizational forms, social network analysis, and automated text analysis. Prior work has demonstrated the applicability of a range of standard multivariate analysis procedures to the structural comparison problem. Here, some simple algorithms are provided which elucidate several of these methods in an easily implemented form.
5834868725ff05a97b015a53	We consider four families of pancake graphs, which are Cayley graphs, whose vertex sets are either the symmetric group on n objects or the hyperoctahedral group on n objects and whose generating sets are either all reversals or all reversals inverting the first k elements (called prefix reversals). We find that the girth of each family of pancake graphs remains constant after some small threshold value of n.
5834868625ff05a97b011939	In this paper we present a method for incrementally segmenting large RGB-D maps as they are being created. Recent advances in dense RGB-D mapping have led to maps of increasing size and density. Segmentation of these raw maps is a first step for higher-level tasks such as object detection. Current popular methods of segmentation scale linearly with the size of the map and generally include all points. Our method takes a previously segmented map and segments new data added to that map incrementally online.
5834868525ff05a97b00f439	Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations outof-date.
5834868725ff05a97b014791	The method of the analytic continuation of the function given on a part of the boundary into the whole domain is applied to the Riemann hypothesis on the Zeta function zeros. Comprehensive numerical experiments have been performed with the Mathematica. The computational approach confirmed the Riemann hypothesis.
5834868725ff05a97b014793	Using the product theorem for the Mellin transform, a definite integral depending on several parameters and containing a product of two polylogarithm functions (or two logarithms in the degenerate case) is replaced by a Mellin–Barnes integral, which in turn is evaluated by residue techniques. The results are given in terms of infinite series of hypergeometric type. Some special cases for which the infinite series can be expressed in closed form are also considered.
5834868725ff05a97b01479b	The functional equation for the Hurwitz Zeta function ζ (s, a) is used to obtain formulas for derivatives of ζ (s, a) at negative odd s and rational a. For several of these rational arguments, closed-form expressions are given in terms of simpler transcendental functions, like the logarithm, the polygamma function, and the Riemann Zeta function.
5834868725ff05a97b0159e8	This paper presents optimizations for verifying systems with complex time-invariant constraints. These constraints arise naturally from modeling physical systems, eg, in establishing the relationship between different components in a system. To verify constraint-rich systems, we propose two new optimizations. The first optimization is a simple, yet powerful, extension of the conjunctivepartitioning algorithm. The second is a collection of BDD-based macro-extraction and macro-expansion algorithms to remove state variables.
5834868525ff05a97b00f6f4	With the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, we are facing an exponential increase in the amount of genomic sequence data. The success of all medical and genetic applications of next-generation sequencing critically depends on the existence of computational techniques that can process and analyze the enormous amount of sequence data quickly and accurately. Unfortunately, the current read mapping algorithms have difficulties in coping with the massive amounts of data generated by NGS.
5834868625ff05a97b011e7f	We call a function smooth if it is infinitely differentiable. The rank of a function/at x is the rank of its derivative matrix Df (x). By full rank we mean the maximal possible rank: an mxk matrix is of full rank if its rank is min {m, jfc}. When we say simply that/is of full rank, we mean it is of full rank throughout its domain.
5834868725ff05a97b015a56	We present a new technique for verification of complex hardware devices that allows both generality and a high degree of automation. The technique is based on our new way of constructing a “light-weight” completion function together with new encoding of uninterpreted functions called reference file representation.
5834868625ff05a97b012929	This paper addresses a torque control method in a high friction robot manipulator. A stiction feed-forward compensator is proposed to eliminate the control problem caused by the nonlinear friction and disturbance. In order to control a robot manipulator with unknown effects, a time-delay control method is used to control the torque. One degree of freedom flexible joint robot manipulator with a joint torque sensor is used to show the performance of the proposed control method.
5834868525ff05a97b00f446	We define a notion of local sensitivity for classes of prior densities. The local sensitivity measures how much a small change in the prior affects the posterior. We find an explicit expression for this local sensitivity and we use it as a diagnostic for robustness. We also show that the local sensitivity can be used to find simple, accurate approximations to upper and lower bounds of posterior expectations.
5834868725ff05a97b0159fb	Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) play a key role in the automated synthesis and formal verification of digital systems. They are the state-of-the-art data structure for representing switching functions in various branches of electronic design automation. In the following we discuss the properties of this data structure, characterize its algorithmic behavior, and describe some prominent applications.
5834868725ff05a97b0159fd	An N-bit RAM can be verified by simulating just O (N log N) patterns. This approach to verification is fast, requires minimal attention on the part of the user to the circuit details, and can utilize more sophisticated circuit models than other approaches to formal verification. The technique has been applied to a CMOS static RAM design using the COSMOS switch-level simulator. By simulating many patterns in parallel, a massively parallel computer can verify a 4K RAM in under 6 min.
5834868625ff05a97b012b0d	We introduce a maximum entropy-based analysis technique for extracting and characterizing rhythmic expression profiles from DNA microarray hybridization data. These patterns are clues to discovering genes implicated in cell-cycle, circadian, and other periodic biological processes. The algorithm, implemented in a program called ENRAGE (Entropy-based Rhythmic Analysis of Gene Expression), treats the task of estimating an expression profile's periodicity and phase as a simultaneous bicriterion optimization problem.
5834868625ff05a97b012a55	JANUS-II is a research system to design and test components of speech-to-speech translation systems as well as a research prototype for such a system. We focus on two aspects of the system:(1) the new features of the speech recognition component JANUS-SR, and (2) the end-to-end performance of JANUS-II, including a comparison of two machine translation strategies used for JANUS-MT (PHOENIX and GLR*).
5834868725ff05a97b0147e7	The idea of a retroactive version of a data structure is to maintain a time-ordered sequence of operations while allowing the user to revise the operation sequence by invoking and revoking (ie, inserting and deleting, respectively) operations anywhere in the sequence—including backwards in time. In many applications of retroactivity, operations depend on the outcomes of previous queries, and therefore the data structures need to identify the queries whose outcome changes when a revision is performed retroactively.
5834868625ff05a97b012a82	This paper describes our submission to the WMT10 Shared Evaluation Task and MetricsMATR10. We present a version of the Meteor-next metric with paraphrase tables for five target languages. We describe the creation of these paraphrase tables and conduct a tuning experiment that demonstrates consistent improvement across all languages over baseline versions of the metric without paraphrase resources.
5834868725ff05a97b014830	Our demo illustrates the benefit of dsync, a file transfer tool built within the Data-Oriented Transfer service, in a software synchronization scenario; dsync updates hundreds of PlanetLab nodes to the desired software version using only a single original source in real time while outperforming today's state-of-the-art systems, rsync and BitTorrent. Our demo will also highlight the effectiveness of dsync in dealing with a diverse range of operating conditions.
5834868725ff05a97b015a20	We present a collection of ideas that allows the pipeline verification method pioneered by Burch and Dill [5] to scale very efficiently to dual-issue super-scalar processors. We achieve a significant speedup in the verification of such processors, compared to the result by Burch [6], while using an entirely automatic tool. Instrumental to our success are exploiting the properties of positive equality [3][4] and the simplification capabilities of BDDs.
5834868725ff05a97b015a24	We show a reduction to propositional logic from a Boolean combination of inequalities of the form vi≥ vj+ c and vi> vj+ c, where c is a constant and vi, vj are variables of type real or integer. Equalities and uninterpreted functions can be expressed in this logic as well. We discuss the advantages of using this reduction as compared to competing methods, and present experimental results that support our claims.
5834868725ff05a97b015abf	We describe an algorithm to verify a hardware design given in Verilog using an ANSI-C program as a specification. We use SAT based Bounded Model Checking [1] in order to reduce the equivalence problem to a bit vector logic decision problem. As a case study, we describe experimental results on a hardware and a software implementation of the data encryption standard (DES) algorithm.
5834868725ff05a97b01407a	Concurrent with Riezman's report (Riezman, H. 1985, Cell. 40: 1001-1009) that fluid-phase endocytosis of the small molecule Lucifer yellow occurs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Makarow (Makarow, M. 1985. EMBO [Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.] J. 4: 1861-1866) reported the endocytotic uptake of 70-kD FITC-dextran (FD) and its subsequent compartmentation into the yeast vacuole. Samples of FD synthesized and purified here failed to label yeast vacuoles under conditions that allowed labeling using commercial FD.
5834868625ff05a97b01239d	In most software projects, resolved bugs are archived for future reference. These bug reports contain valuable information on the reported problem, investigation and resolution. When bug triaging, developers look for how similar problems were resolved in the past. Search over bug repository gives the developer a set of recommended bugs to look into. However, the developer still needs to manually peruse the contents of the recommended bugs which might vary in size from a couple of lines to thousands.
5834868725ff05a97b0140cf	Resumen Partiendo de la suite xawtv de captura y reproducción de video en entorno Linux, se ha diseñado un sistema por el que la aplicación es capaz de enviar y recibir video a través de la red usando los protocolos de transmisión UDP y RTP. Además, pueden negociarse parámetros sobre la calidad de servicio, y todo ello con una filosofía de diseño basada en plugins.
5834868725ff05a97b014171	We identify two vulnerabilities for existing highspeed network-layer anonymity protocols, such as LAP and Dovetail. First, the header formats of LAP and Dovetail leak path information, reducing the anonymity-set size when an adversary launches topological attacks. Second, ASes can launch session hijacking attacks to deanonymize destinations. HORNET addresses these problems but incurs additional bandwidth overhead and latency.
5834868625ff05a97b01261a	The value of effective collaboration has become increasingly critical for organizational performance and agility. Along with technical and managerial strategies, the workspace spatial environment needs to be recognized and studied for its impact on collaboration and interactive behavior at work. Most spatial parameters studied in the workplace research literature are workstation-scale characteristics. However, these may not sufficiently describe the variety of shared spaces in which collaborative work and interactions take place.
5834868625ff05a97b01363e	Objectives Similar to the experience in the speech research community, consumer‐created (as opposed to Broadcast‐News style) multimedia material offers a great opportunity for research on all aspects of Human‐to‐human as well as Man‐machine interaction. Speech and audio is naturally an important part of these interactions, able to link visual objects, people, and other observations across modalities; research results gathered on this offline data will inform future experiments in interactive settings (robotics, interactive agents, etc.).
5834868625ff05a97b012e52	ASAP is a position-measurement instrument developed to measure human hand tremor. It makes 1000 five-degree-of-freedom position measurements per second with 3 micron resolution over a 3cm workspace. The measurement principle is optical triangulation of modulated lights on the probe using position-sensitive-diode (PSD) sensors.
5834868625ff05a97b01221b	Software product line engineering is an efficient means to generate a set of tailored software products from a common implementation. However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semi-automatic tool support-called variability mining-to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code.
5834868725ff05a97b0154db	The inevitable proliferation of expert systems underscores the need for robust, friendly interfaces requiring minimal user training. The objective of the XCALIBUR project is to meet this need by providing natural comprehension and generation in the context of a focused mixed-initiative dialog. The XCALIBUR architecture is discussed, including its three central components (parser, generator and information manager), its methods of handling ellipsis and imperfect input, and its relation to the underlying expert system.
5834868625ff05a97b0111ce	Method and system for adjusting video and audio settings for a media output device. The system comprises a control unit having a media signal input. The media signal comprises at least one of a video and an audio component, as well as an associated informational component. The control unit extracts the informational component and adjusts at least one setting of the media output device based on the informational component.
5834868625ff05a97b012e58	CMUCL is a free, high-performance implementation of the Common Lisp programming language, which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp Standard. CMUCL features a sophisticated native-code compiler, a foreign function interface, a graphical source-level debugger, an interface to the X11 Window System, and an Emacs-like editor.
5834868625ff05a97b012a18	Many implementations of research techniques that automatically repair software bugs target programs written in C. Work that targets Java often begins from or compares to direct translations of such techniques to a Java context. However, Java and C are very different languages, and Java should be studied to inform the construction of repair approaches to target it. We conduct a large-scale study of bug-fixing commits in Java projects, focusing on assumptions underlying common search-based repair approaches.
5834868625ff05a97b01222c	An ongoing problem in revision control systems is how to resolve conflicts in a merge of independently developed revisions. Unstructured revision control systems are purely text-based and solve conflicts based on textual similarity. Structured revision control systems are tailored to specific languages and use language-specific knowledge for conflict resolution. We propose semistructured revision control systems that inherit the strengths of both: the generality of unstructured systems and the expressiveness of structured systems.
5834868725ff05a97b0139f6	Provides an overview of a speech-to-text (STT) and keyword search (KWS) system architecture build primarily on the top of the Kaldi toolkit and expands on a few highlights. The system was developed as a part of the research efforts of the Radical team while participating in the IARPA Babel program. Our aim was to develop a general system pipeline which could be easily and rapidly deployed in any language, independently on the language script and phonological and linguistic features of the language.
5834868625ff05a97b012ea9	The increasing number of mammalian genome sequences becoming available provides scientists with dramatic opportunities to computationally reconstruct ancestral mammalian genomic sequences by comparing the genomes of living descendants. In this article, we review computational genome reconstruction methods in different scales, from base-level reconstruction to chromosomal rearrangement reconstruction.
5834868625ff05a97b011246	摘要: P2P-VoD 中的跳转操作需要高效的节点搜索, 如何快速查找到“合适” 的节点给我们提出了挑战.“合适” 包含两方面因素: 1) 内容匹配; 2) 物理性能匹配. 而传统的方法大部分只涉及对前者的研究. 在本文中, 我们提出了一种层次化的搜索模型(简称Mediacoop), 不仅可以让搜索到的节点在内容上满足要求, 而且在物理性能上也能满足要求. 具体而言, Mediacoop 首先利用播放距离来索引全部节点, 再利用延迟特征优选内容上已经符合要求的节点. 在NS2 模拟器上的实验表明, Mediacoop 在用户体验和系统开销上均优于传统的方法.
5834868625ff05a97b012eca	Accurately reconstructing the large-scale gene order in an ancestral genome is a critical step to better understand genome evolution. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm for reconstructing ancestral genomic orders with duplications. The method starts from the order of genes in modern genomes and predicts predecessor and successor relationships in the ancestor. Then a greedy algorithm is used to reconstruct the ancestral orders by connecting genes into contiguous regions based on predicted adjacencies.
5834868725ff05a97b015911	A network analytic approach to the study of organizational response to crises is used to determine the existence and form of integrated crisis management units (ICMUs). ICMUs are network organizations that emerge in response to severe crises such as major oil spills, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural and man made disasters. Although ICMUs have received considerable attention from scholars in the form of empirical case studies, much remains unclear as to their nascent interorganizational structure and structural evolution.
5834868725ff05a97b01477d	We examine original solutions for two-dimensional problems of nonsteady heat conduction in the case of an orthotropic half-space with discontinuous mixed boundary conditions; these are used to develop new methods of controlling thermophysical properties in a nondestructive manner.
5834868625ff05a97b01300a	We present students with common errors of others in the context of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). We conducted two studies with students of different curriculum levels to measure the effects of learning through such erroneous examples. We report that erroneous examples with additional support can assist lower curriculum level students develop better meta-cognitive skills.
5834868725ff05a97b0147ff	We present language mechanisms for polymorphic, extensible records and their exact dual, polymorphic sums with extensible first-class cases. These features make it possible to easily extend existing code with new cases. In fact, such extensions do not require any changes to code that adheres to a particular programming style. Using that style, individual extensions can be written independently and later be composed to form larger components. These language mechanisms provide a solution to the expression problem.
5834868725ff05a97b014a7b	Mayday is an architecture that combines overlay networks with lightweight packet filtering to defend against denial of service attacks. The overlay nodes perform client authentication and protocol verification, and then relay the requests to a protected server. The server is protected from outside attack by simple packet filtering rules that can be efficiently deployed even in backbone routers.
5834868725ff05a97b014aae	Like all robot soccer teams, CMDragons' 03 (shown in Figure 1) is an integration of a number of complex components into a seamless whole. In this team description, we describe the key components for our system as used at RoboCup 2003. Specifically, we address how the system as a whole fits together and what issues must be considered for such integration. Readers should note that much of the work described here is available as an implementation in our official source code release, which can be found at http://www.
5834868625ff05a97b011d07	We present a telecentric lens that is able to gain 3D information. The proposed lens system has multiple aperture stops, which enable it to capture multidirectional parallel light rays, while a conventional telecentric lens has only one aperture stop and can capture only light rays that are perpendicular to the lens. We explain the geometry of the multiaperture telecentric system and show that correspondences fall on a line like those in a conventional stereo. As it is a single-lens sensor, we also introduce the principles of 3D reconstruction.

Regions A through F are related \nto region R as follows: A before R; B overlaps-start R; C contains R; D in R; E overlaps-end \nR; and F after R.   Figure 3: Region relations with coincident endpoints. Regions A through \nF are related to region R as follows: A just-before R; B at-start-of R; C at-end-of R; D starts-with \nR; E ends-with R; and F just-after R.   In Figure 2, the regions B, C, D, and E overlap R, but A \nand F do not. In Figure 3, all the regions overlap R.
5834868625ff05a97b01302a	Erratum: Figures 13 and 15 are transposed. parts in the plane by pushing, particularly when the parts are too large or heavy to be grasped and lifted. Unfortunately, the motion of a pushed object is generally unpredictable due to unknown support friction forces. With multiple pushing contact points, however, it is possible to find pushing directions that cause the object to remain fixed to the manipulator. These are called stable pushing directions. In this article we consider the problem of planning pushing paths using stable pushes.
5834868725ff05a97b01555a	In this issue of Critical Horizons Gerry Gill reminds us of Augustine's description of the origins of the Christian era as being between two worlds-'one dead, the other powerless to be born'. Similarly, it could be argued that as contemporaries we are also between two worlds. One of these worlds has taken form through the long history of modernity, with its assertive self-confidence and its uneasy embeddedness in traditions and forms of life that, as Weber observed, it at once both relies upon and yet desires to displace and destroy.
5834868725ff05a97b014815	Self-adjusting computation offers a language-centric approach to writing programs that can automatically respond to modifications to their data (eg, inputs). Except for several domain-specific implementations, however, all previous implementations of self-adjusting computation assume mostly functional, higher-order languages such as Standard ML. Prior to this work, it was not known if self-adjusting computation can be made to work with low-level, imperative languages such as C without placing undue burden on the programmer.
5834868625ff05a97b0112a6	We describe CMU LTI's participation in the KBP 2015 Event Track. We officially participated in Task 1: Event Nugget Detection track and Task 3: Event Coreference track. Our system rank high in both tracks. We found that our combined system is competitive but have room to improve. In addition, we have conducted follow up experiments by creating a simple piplined system, and We found it competitive comparing to the official submissions.
5834868725ff05a97b015973	This paper studies the effects of boosting in the context of different classification methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classifier. We identify the inductive biases of each classifier and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not effective in improving the performance of the base classifiers on common categories.

5834868725ff05a97b014b4f	We describe Ayudame, a system designed to recognize and translate Spanish emergency calls for better dispatching. We analyze the research challenges in adapting speech translation technology to 9-1-1 domain. We report our initial research in 9-1-1 translation system design, ASR experiments, and utterance classification for translation.
5834868625ff05a97b011d70	In this paper, we present a sensor guided ablation procedure of highly motile left atrium. It uses a system which automatically registers the 4D heart model with the position sensor on the catheter, and visualizes the heart model and the position of the catheter together in real time. With this system clinicians can easily map the motile left atrium shape and see where the catheter is inside it, therefore greatly improve the efficiency of the ablation operation.
5834868725ff05a97b014b76	This paper describes the formal power of feature grammars such as Generalised Phrase Structured Grammars (GPSG) 1]. It shows how such grammars relate to context-free grammar (Chomsky type 2) and which extensions cause the formalism to increase in power to context-sensitive grammar and beyond. Also, it describes how any Turing machine can be implemented as a feature grammar showing that the power of such grammars is beyond context-free. Finally some discussion is given on the relevance of the these results.
5834868725ff05a97b0136e4	This paper argues that “hardware compilers”(broadly construed as systems that automate any part of the VLSI design process) should be classified not simply by their input and output languages, but by how they treat the various kinds of decisions made in the design process. It examines several aspects of decision making and attempts to classify some hardware compiler efforts with respect to this framework.
5834868725ff05a97b0136ef	The ability to log tutorial interactions in comprehensive, longitudinal, finegrained detail offers great potential for educational data mining–but what data is logged, and how, can facilitate or impede the realization of that potential. We propose guidelines gleaned over 15 years of logging, exploring, and analyzing millions of events from Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor and its predecessors.
5834868625ff05a97b011d7e	Using images to interface machines and humans offers an exciting new application domain for image understanding (IU). This article describes two such applications: digital libraries that bring visual data to the user, and virtualized reality that brings users to the visual data. The digital library calls on IU techniques such as scene segmentation and content analysis, and joins together natural language analysis and IU. Virtualized reality uses precise, dense, and video-rate stereo reconstruction techniques.
5834868725ff05a97b014b96	In this paper, we describe NineOneOne (9-1-1), a system designed to recognize and translate Spanish emergency calls for better dispatching. We analyze the research challenges in adapting speech translation technology to 9-1-1 domain. We report our initial research towards building the system and the results of our initial experiments.
5834868725ff05a97b014b9a	In spoken dialog systems, dialog state tracking refers to the task of correctly inferring the user's goal at a given turn, given all of the dialog history up to that turn. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge is a research community challenge task that has run for three rounds. The challenge has given rise to a host of new methods for dialog state tracking, and also deeper understandings about the problem itself, including methods for evaluation.
5834868725ff05a97b013709	We discuss pros and cons of several ways to evaluate ASR accuracy in automated tutors that listen to students read aloud. Whether ASR is accurate enough for a particular reading tutor function depends on what ASR-based judgment it requires, the visibility of that judgment to students and teachers, and the amount of input speech on which it is based. How to tell depends on the purpose, criterion, and space of the evaluation.
5834868625ff05a97b012dd2	A novel boundary condition is introduced to calculate the adhesion of similar and dissimilar thin-walled microstructures. By casting the energy release rate for debonding in terms of a discontinuity in bending curvature at the contact boundary, it is possible to study such systems using conventional plate theory. This result is of particular importance in modeling the aggregation of heterogeneous carbon-nano-tubes or spherical cells, where the contacting microstructures have a different radius and/or bending stiffness.
5834868725ff05a97b01372c	Learning by explaining failures and avoiding similar ones thereafter is an attractive way to speed up problem solving. However, previous methods for explanation-based learning from failure can take too long to detect failures, explain them, or test the learned rules. This expense is especially critical foradaptive search, in which control knowledge acquired while solving an individual problem instance must be learned quickly enough to speed up its solution.
5834868625ff05a97b011d9f	In this paper, we present a left atrium registration system which utilizes a 3D intra-cardiac ultrasound catheter for faster (more than 700 times) and higher quality surface registration point collection than current systems and eventually improves the registration accuracy and stability. With better registration our system can greatly improve the ablation catheter navigation system which is being used in many hospitals to guide left atrium endocardium ablation procedure.
5834868625ff05a97b013038	Sensing the forces applied to the palm of a robot manipulator requires robust compliant sensors guarded against collision. The force sensing palm for the MLab Simple Hand measures three components of net contact force in a simple robust design using flexure springs and optical position sensing. The hand is calibrated in an automatic process. Measurements are included to compare performance to the theoretical model.
5834868725ff05a97b01556b	ATLAS is a front-end for UCLID. The main purpose of ATLAS is to perform semi-automatic term-level abstraction on a UCLID model. During the implementation of ATLAS we extended the UCLID language to include additional features. The extensions to the UCLID language break backward compatibility and for that reason, we explain the ATLAS-extended UCLID language before we describe how to use ATLAS.
5834868625ff05a97b0112b4	Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the enterprise of automatically producing text (in English or any other human language) from computer-internal representations of information. Usually, the process involves three stages: macroplanning (of content), microplanning (of form), and realisation (of sentences).

5834868725ff05a97b015571	There are several clever ways to determine the two's complement negation of a value represented at the bit level. These techniques are both useful, such as when one encounters the value 0xfffffffa when debugging a program, and they lend insight into the nature of the two's complement representation.
5834868725ff05a97b013b26	The main challenge of next years is to allow users of software systems, who are non-professional software developers, to create, modify or extend software artefacts. In this panel we want to discuss with the CHI community the key aspects in the area of End User Development and an associated research agenda, which should be then proposed to the main research agencies, such as NSF and EU ICT.
5834868625ff05a97b0123df	We developed Name-It, a system that associates faces and names in news videos. It processes information from the videos and can infer possible name candidates for a given face or locate a face in news videos by name. To accomplish this task, the system takes a multimodal video analysis approach: face sequence extraction and similarity evaluation from videos, name extraction from transcripts, and video-caption recognition.
5834868625ff05a97b0112db	This paper describes the Entrance Exams task at the CLEF QA Track 2015. Following the last two editions, the data set has been extracted from actual university entrance examinations including a variety of topics and question types. Systems receive a set of Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension tests where the task is to select the correct answer among a finite set of candidates, according to the given text. Questions are designed originally for testing human examinees, rather than evaluating computer systems.
5834868625ff05a97b012ba9	In this paper we present a novel data structure for sparse vectors based on Cuckoo hashing. It is highly memory efficient and allows for random access at near dense vector level rates. This allows us to solve sparse l 1 programming problems exactly and without preprocessing at a cost that is identical to dense linear algebra both in terms of memory and speed. Our approach provides a feasible alternative to the hash kernel and it excels whenever exact solutions are required, such as for feature selection.
5834868625ff05a97b012dd7	Several recent designs of soft robots feature locomotion mechanisms that entail orchestrating changes to intrinsic curvature to enable the robot׳ s limbs to either stick, adhere, or slip on the robot׳ s workspace. The resulting locomotion mechanism has several features in common with peristaltic locomotion that can be found in the animal world. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the feasibility of, and design guidelines for, a locomotion mechanism that exploits the control of intrinsic curvature on a rough surface.
5834868525ff05a97b00f746	The electromotive force induced by a moving magnetic domain wall in a nanostrip has been calculated theoretically and detected experimentally. It is found that the emf depends only on the domain wall transformation frequency through a universal Josephson type relation, which is closely related to the topological nature of the domain wall. Our experimental measurements confirm the theoretical prediction.
5834868625ff05a97b011ddc	For pt. 1 see ibid., p. 31-42 (1991). A description is given of EDDIE, the architecture for the Navlab mobile robot which provides a toolkit for building specific systems quickly and easily. Included in the discussion are the annotated maps used by EDDIE and the Navlab's road-following system, called the Autonomous Mail Vehicle, which was built using EDDIE and its annotated maps as a basis. The contributions of the Navlab project and the lessons learned from it are examined.
5834868725ff05a97b01507a	We propose a new MDS paradigm called readeraware multi-document summarization (RA-MDS). Specifically, a set of reader comments associated with the news reports are also collected. The generated summaries from the reports for the event should be salient according to not only the reports but also the reader comments. To tackle this RAMDS problem, we propose a sparse-coding-based method that is able to calculate the salience of the text units by jointly considering news reports and reader comments.
5834868725ff05a97b01557a	Parallel hashing is well-known in the folklore of parallel computing, but there has been a remarkable dearth of literature describing it in detail. Because many parallel algorithms such as histogramming, set intersection and dictionary lookup can make use of hashing as a core step, hashing is a fundamental parallel operation. This paper sheds light on the performance that may be achieved using parallel hashing algorithms and should lend credibility to their use.

5834868625ff05a97b0123f4	SUMMARY In this paper, a process is described for analysing the motion of a human target in \na video stream. Mov- ing targets are detected and their boundaries extracted. From these, a \n“star” skeleton is produced. Two motion cues are deter- mined from this skeletonization: body \nposture, and cyclic motion of skeleton segments. These cues are used to determine human activities \nsuch as walking or running, and even potentially, the target's gait. Unlike other methods, this \ndoes not require an a priori human model, or a large number of “pixels on target”.
5834868725ff05a97b01598f	The inevitable proliferation of expert systems underscores the need for robust, friendly interfaces requiring minimal user training. The objective of the XCALIBUR project is to meet this need by providing natural comprehension and generation in the context of a focused mixed-initiative dialog. The XCALIBUR architecture is discussed, including its three central components (parser, generator and information manager), its methods of handling ellipsis and imperfect input, and its relation to the underlying expert system.
5834868625ff05a97b0123f6	Given a single picture which is a projection of a three-dimensional scene onto the two-dimensional picture plane, we usually have definite ideas about the 3-D shapes of objects. To do this we need to use assumptions about the world and the image formation process, since there exist a large number of shapes which can produce the same picture.
5834868625ff05a97b012e43	We describe an indoor pedestrian tracking system developed for homeland security nuclear radiation search and mapping. The user initializes approximate position and orientation on a prior map. A low-cost body-mounted IMU is used to detect steps and heading change, and this dead-reckoned estimate is registered onto the map using a particle filter.. Experimental evaluation in two buildings with two walkers shows position accuracy of 0.5 m–2m RMS, depending on the degree of local constraint in the floorplan.

5834868625ff05a97b013577	We discuss non-parametric density estimation and regression for astrophysics problems. In particular, we show how to compute non-parametric confidence intervals for the location and size of peaks of a function. We illustrate these ideas with recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also briefly discuss non-parametric Bayesian inference.

This language still possesses the declarative semantics of pure Prolog.
5834868625ff05a97b013089	Home-energy studies suggest that providing users with real-time and cross-household feedback may nudge users toward sustainable behaviors. Although methods of comparison yield significant savings, only a limited amount of homeenergy research has explored social communication with feedback devices. Inspired by our prior energy studies in low-income communities, we present the results of a needs-validation study and provide design implications for real-time, communitybased feedback displays.
5834868625ff05a97b013583	OBJECTIVE We present T-Cube, a new tool for very fast retrieval and analysis of time series data. Using a novel method of data caching, T-Cube performs time series queries approximately 1,000 times faster than standard state-of-the-art data cube technologies. This speedup has two main benefits: it enables fast anomaly detection by simultaneous statistical analysis of many thousands of time series, and it allows public health users to perform many complex, ad hoc time series queries on the fly without inconvenient delays.
5834868625ff05a97b01358b	Detecting and counting overdensities in data is a common problem in the physical and geographic sciences. One of the most successful of recent algorithms for the counting version of the problem was introduced by Cuevas, Febrero and Fraiman [Cuevas et al., 2000], which will be referred to as the CFF algorithm. This algorithm first determines the subset of data points that are in high density regions using a non-parametric density estimator. A clustering step follows where such high density points are agglomerated.
5834868625ff05a97b013544	The goal of this paper is to analyze and model the variability in speaking styles in dyadic interactions and build a predictive algorithm for listener responses that is able to adapt to these different styles. The end result of this research will be a virtual human able to automatically respond to a human speaker with proper listener responses (eg, head nods). Our novel speaker-adaptive prediction model is created from a corpus of dyadic interactions where speaker variability is analyzed to identify a subset of prototypical speaker styles.
5834868625ff05a97b012212	The feature-interaction problem has been keeping researchers and practitioners in suspense for years. Although there has been substantial progress in developing approaches for modeling, detecting, managing, and resolving feature interactions, we lack sufficient knowledge on the kind of feature interactions that occur in real-world systems. In this position paper, we set out the goal to explore the nature of feature interactions systematically and comprehensively, classified in terms of order and visibility.
5834868625ff05a97b012246	A software product line is a family of related programs that are distinguished in terms of features. A feature implements a stakeholders' requirement. Different program variants specified by distinct feature selections are produced from a common code base. The optional feature problem describes a common mismatch between variability intended in the domain and dependencies in the implementation. When this situation occurs, some variants that are valid in the domain cannot be produced due to implementation issues.

5834868725ff05a97b015d1a	Holzmann is among a small group of researchers who are committed to developing tools, techniques, and procedures for increasing design reliability. Currently, most programs are debugged and then refined by random testing. Testing can be useful to pinpoint smaller errors, say researchers, but inadequate when it comes to identifying structural ones. And tests designed for specific scenarios may not be able to explore combinations of behavior that fall outside of anticipated patterns. The search is therefore on for additional strategies.
5834868725ff05a97b015d1b	High-level synthesis facilitates the use of formal verification methodologies that check the equivalence of the generated RTL model against the original source specification. The article provides an overview of sequential equivalence checking techniques, its challenges, and successes in real-world designs.
5834868625ff05a97b012e1f	Massive, Open, Online Courses (MOOCs) have been promoted as a means to revolutionize access to education. In this paper, we describe experiences with MOOCs for Liberian students who are connected to the iLab technology hub. We describe their motivations for participating as well as the challenges they encountered. We also describe the importance of the face-to-face learning environment provided by the iLab as a source of community support.
5834868725ff05a97b013df5	We show that given a 3-colorable graph, it is NP-hard to find a 3-coloring with (16/17+ &egr;) of the edges bichromatic. In a related result, we show that given a satisfiable instance of the 2-to-1 Label Cover problem, it is NP-hard to find a (23/24+ &egr;)-satisfying assignment.
5834868725ff05a97b0148e9	Whether evolutionary robotics (ER) controllers evolve in simulation or on real robots, realworld performance is the true test of an evolved controller. Controllers must overcome the noise inherent in real environments to operate robots efficiently and safely. To prevent a poorly performing controller from damaging a vehicle—susceptible vehicles include statically unstable walking robots, flying vehicles, and underwater vehicles—it is necessary to test evolved controllers extensively in simulation before transferring them to real robots.
5834868725ff05a97b014940	The complementarity of gene expression and protein–DNA interaction data led to several successful models of biological systems. However, recent studies in multiple species raise doubts about the relationship between these two datasets. These studies show that the overwhelming majority of genes bound by a particular transcription factor (TF) are not affected when that factor is knocked out. Here, we show that this surprising result can be partially explained by considering the broader cellular context in which TFs operate.
5834868625ff05a97b0132e1	An important activity in collaborative writing is communicating about changes to texts,, This paper reports on a software system, ji'exible cliff, that finds and reports differences (“cliffs”) between versions of texts. The system is flexible, allowing users to control several aspects of its operation including what changes are reported and how they are shown when they are reported. We argue that such flexibility is necessary to support users' different social and cognitive needs.
5834868725ff05a97b013e0b	We show that distinguishing 1/2-satisfiable Unique-Games instances from (3/8+ ε)-satisfiable instances is NP-hard (for all ε> 0). A consequence is that we match or improve the best known c vs. s NP-hardness result for Unique-Games for all values of c (except for c very close to 0). For these c, ours is the first hardness result showing that it helps to take the alphabet size larger than 2. Our NP-hardness reductions are quasilinear-size and thus show nearly full exponential time is required, assuming the ETH.

Thus the Woods2 and multiplexer results are consistent with the theory presented in Section 4.1, and indicate that, in general, it is better to do the GA in the action sets.
5834868625ff05a97b012352	This paper describes the basic control, navigation, and mapping methods and experiments a hovering autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to explore flooded cenotes in Mexico as part of the DEPTHX project. We describe the low level control system of the vehicle, and present a dead reckoning navigation filter that compensates for frequent Doppler velocity log (DVL) dropouts. Sonar data collected during autonomous excursions in a limestone quarry are used to generate a map of the quarry geometry.
5834868725ff05a97b015064	We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning constraints on unlabeled data. Both traditional supervised classification tasks and many natural semisupervised learning heuristics can be approximated by specifying the desired outcome of walks through a graph of classifiers. We demonstrate the modeling capability of this approach in the task of relation extraction, and experimental results show that the modeled constraints achieve better performance as expected.
5834868725ff05a97b015be4	AnalyticaV is a theorem proving system that is built on top of the symbolic computation system Mathematica. It was originally designed by E. Clarke and X. Zhao in the early 1990's. We describe here a redesign of the system that extends its abilities to reasoning about some aspects of number theory.
5834868625ff05a97b011ec5	This paper describes design and development of two types of 3-D ranging devices for robotic applications: both are noncontact, optical devices based on active illumination and triangulation. One is a laser scanning ranging device for medium-range (50cm). and the other is a proximity range sensor for short range (5 cm). The features of the devices are that both use analog area position sensor chips and that they provide simple, fast, accurate, non-contact visual sensing of range information.

5834868725ff05a97b015066	Knowledge bases (KBs) such as Freebase and Yago are rather incomplete, and the situation is more serious in non-English KBs, such as Chinese KBs. In this paper, we present a language-independent framework to tackle the slot-filling task by searching the Web with high-precision queries, and deriving lightweight extraction patterns. The patterns are based on string matching, and since they make no use of complex NLP resources, which may be unavailable in some languages, they are very language-independent.

5834868725ff05a97b0159b6	Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation systems produce semantically accurate translations, but typically require massive knowledge acquisition. This paper describes KANT, a system that reduces this requirement to produce practical, scalable, and accurate KBMT applications. First, the set of requirements is discussed, then the full KANT architecture is illustrated, and finally results from a fully implemented prototype are presented.
5834868725ff05a97b0159b8	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868725ff05a97b01495f	Background Time series microarray experiments are widely used to study dynamical biological processes. Due to the cost of microarray experiments, and also in some cases the limited availability of biological material, about 80% of microarray time series experiments are short (3–8 time points). Previously short time series gene expression data has been mainly analyzed using more general gene expression analysis tools not designed for the unique challenges and opportunities inherent in short time series gene expression data.
5834868525ff05a97b00f603	Abstract—We show that expander codes, when properly instantiated, are high-rate list-recoverable codes with linear-time list recovery algorithms. List recoverable codes have been useful recently in constructing efficiently listdecodable codes, as well as explicit constructions of matrices for compressive sensing and group testing. Previous list-recoverable codes with linear-time decoding algorithms have all had rate at most 1/2; in contrast, our codes can have rate 1− ε for any ε> 0.

5834868725ff05a97b013e36	The paper presents an anaphora resolution algorithm for unrestricted text. In particular, we examine portability of a knowledge-based approach of (Mitamura et al., 2002), proposed for a domain-specific task. We obtain up to 70% accuracy on unrestricted text, which is a significant improvement (almost 20%) over a baseline we set for general text. As the overall results leave much room for improvement, we provide a detailed error analysis and investigate possible enhancements.
5834868725ff05a97b015d2d	Multiple clock domains are a challenge for hardware specification and verification. We present a method for specifying the relations between multiple clocks, and for modeling the possible behaviors. We can then verify a hardware design assuming that the clocks meet these constraints. We implement our ideas in the context of SAT based bounded model checking (BMC), using ANSI-C programs to specify the functional behavior of the design.
5834868625ff05a97b012e7b	Multimedia event detection (MED) is an effective technique for video indexing and retrieval. Current classifier training for MED treats the negative videos equally. However, many negative videos may resemble the positive videos in different degrees. Intuitively, we may capture more informative cues from the negative videos if we assign them fine-grained labels, thus benefiting the classifier learning. Aiming for this, we use a statistical method on both the positive and negative examples to get the decisive attributes of a specific event.
5834868625ff05a97b012384	We describe a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method for a hovering underwater vehicle that will explore underwater caves and tunnels, a true three-dimensional (3D) environment. Our method consists of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter with a 3D evidence grid map representation. We describe a procedure for dynamically adjusting the number of particles to provide real-time performance. We also describe how we adjust the particle filter prediction step to accommodate sensor degradation or failure.
5834868725ff05a97b0159d4	Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a DARPA-sponsored initiative to investigate the state of the art in finding and following new events in a stream of broadcast news stories. The TDT problem consists of three major tasks:(1) segmenting a stream of data, especially recognized speech, into distinct stories;(2) identifying those news stories that are the first to discuss a new event occurring in the news; and (3) given a small number of sample news stories about an event, finding all following stories in the stream.
5834868725ff05a97b0159d7	Fluorescence microscopy is growing dramatically both in terms of technical capabilities and the volume of images generated. Online repositories have been created to provide public access to images and opportunities for joint research for many scientists 1. This has reintroduced challenges faced when sequence and structure databases were being established: developing fast and effective means of searching for records (images) either by context (such as which protein is labeled) or content (such as which pattern it displays).
5834868625ff05a97b012a03	This paper examines a simple model of how a provider ISP charges customer ISPs by assuming the provider ISP wants to maximize its revenue when customer ISPs have the possibility of setting up peering connections. It is shown that finding the optimal pricing is NP-complete, and APX-complete. Customers can respond to price in many ways, including throttling traffic as well as peering. An algorithm is studied which obtains a 1/4 approximation for a wide range of customer responses.
5834868625ff05a97b012c39	Incremental heuristic searches reuse their previous search efforts to speed up the current search. Anytime search algorithms iteratively tune the solutions based on available search time. Anytime D*(AD*) is an incremental anytime search algorithm that combines these two approaches. AD* uses an inflated heuristic to produce bounded suboptimal solutions and improves the solution by iteratively decreasing the inflation factor. If the environment changes, AD* recomputes a new solution by propagating the new costs.
5834868625ff05a97b011c72	Summary form only given. Detailed analysis of a human body in video, especially precise alignment of body parts, is a key technology for advanced surveillance that requires genuine understanding of people's behavior. The problem is far more difficult than whole-body detection and tracking because it has to deal with the high degree of freedom and self occlusion. This talk will discuss some recent progress in this important topic, and suggest further research.
5834868725ff05a97b015ac5	In this paper we propose a new methodology for exploiting abstraction in the context of model-checking. Our technique uses abstract BDDs as its underlying data structure. We also show that our techniques build a more re ned model than traditional compiler-based methods. We provide experimental results to show the usefulness of our method.
5834868725ff05a97b0149d3	We reduce ranking, as measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), to binary classification. The core theorem shows that a binary classification regret of r on the induced binary problem implies an AUC regret of at most 2 r. This is a large improvement over approaches such as ordering according to regressed scores, which have a regret transform of r↦ nr where n is the number of elements.
5834868725ff05a97b015acb	One of the many useful modeling features provided by TB-nets are weak time semantics. When a transition becomes enabled, it may either fire during its firing interval or expire; it is not compelled to fire. STP nets and TPNs have strong time semantics; once a transition becomes enabled it must fire at the prescribed time unless it is disabled by the removal of tokens in the meantime.
5834868725ff05a97b014a3a	We analyze distributed optimization algorithms where parts of data and variables are distributed over several machines and synchronization occurs asynchronously. We prove convergence for the general case of a nonconvex objective plus a convex and possibly nonsmooth penalty. We demonstrate two challenging applications, l1-regularized logistic regression and reconstruction ICA, and present experiments on real datasets with billions of variables using both CPUs and GPUs.
5834868625ff05a97b012c5b	In this paper, we introduce an efficient replanning algorithm for nondeterministic domains, namely what we believe to be the first incremental heuristic minimax search algorithm. We apply it to the dynamic discretization of continuous domains, resulting in an efficient implementation of the parti-game reinforcement-learning algorithm for control in high-dimensional domains.
5834868525ff05a97b00f620	This paper summarizes the discussions of a working group on computer-aided-process-planning (CAPP) in robotic-based CIM systems. The croup consisted of scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds and expertise in robotics and manufacturing. The discussion focused on defining terminology and outlining the problem scope in order to bring such a diverse group to a common level of understanding.
5834868725ff05a97b014a5d	This paper describes the design and implementation of HERD, a key-value system designed to make the best use of an RDMA network. Unlike prior RDMA-based key-value systems, HERD focuses its design on reducing network round trips while using efficient RDMA primitives; the result is substantially lower latency, and throughput that saturates modern, commodity RDMA hardware. HERD has two unconventional decisions: First, it does not use RDMA reads, despite the allure of operations that bypass the remote CPU entirely.

5834868725ff05a97b013bfc	NAND flash memory is a widely used storage medium that can be treated as a noisy channel. Each flash memory cell stores data as the threshold voltage of a floating gate transistor. The threshold voltage can shift as a result of various types of circuit-level noise, introducing errors when data are read from the channel and ultimately reducing flash lifetime. An accurate model of the threshold voltage distribution across flash cells can enable mechanisms within the flash controller that improve channel reliability and device lifetime.
5834868725ff05a97b013733	We present an implemented model for discovering a class of state-space search heuristics. First, abstractions of a state-space problem are generated by dropping information from the problem definition. An optimal solution path for any such abstracted problem gives a lower bound on the true distance to the goal. This bound can be used as an admissible evaluation function for guiding the base-level search. Moreover, if the abstracted goal is unreachable from an abstracted state, the original state can safely be pruned.
5834868625ff05a97b0131e8	We want to build a robot that learns how the world behaves, so that the robot's performance can improve over time. We have constructed a simple task domain, and conducted experiments with two learning robots. This paper describes the task domain, the design of two simple learning robots, and the experimental results obtained so far.
5834868725ff05a97b0157c9	A machine-implemented image processing method includes segmenting a scene into a background scene portion and a foreground scene portion, forming a mosaic for the background scene portion, enhancing the foreground scene portion, and constructing a composite of the background mosaic and the enhanced foreground.
5834868625ff05a97b0131fc	Parts orienting, the process of bringing parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is an important aspect of automated assembly. The most common industrial orienting systems are vibratory bowl feeders, which use the shape and mass properties of parts to orient them. Bowl feeders rely on a sequence of mechanical operations and typically do not use sensors. In this paper, we describe the use of partial information sensors along with a sequence of pushing operations to eliminate uncertainty in the orientations of parts.
5834868725ff05a97b013738	Analysis of failed problem solving efforts enables people to guide subsequent problem solving to avoid similar failures. This kind of learning while doing is essential in complex domains. We define Explanationbased Learning from Failure (ELF), a technique for achieving such a capability, and describe its prototype implementation in Failsafe, a Prolog program that learns from failure while solving floor planning problems.
5834868625ff05a97b01255d	Combining peer tutoring with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) holds the promise of augmenting the current benefits of the ITS. We designed and implements a peer tutoring approach as a addition to the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA), an ITS for high school algebra. We then used 30 students to evaluate the potential of the peer tutoring addition to increase learning. Although students learned and interacted positively. peer tutors lacked the necessary expertise to adequately help their tutees.
5834868625ff05a97b011354	This paper describes the annotation process being used in a multi-site project to create six sizable bilingual parallel corpora annotated with a consistent interlingua representation. After presenting the background and objectives of the effort, we describe the multilingual corpora and the three stages of interlingual representation being developed. We then focus on the annotation process itself, including an interface environment that supports the annotation task, and the methodology for evaluating the interlingua representation.
5834868625ff05a97b01309a	Research in the field of ambient displays has burgeoned within the past several years, but a coherent view of the design space has yet to be articulated. We present a synopsis of key design dimensions for ambient displays based on a survey of existing ambient displays. This paper presents our findings, referencing representative work for each design component, and in the process introduce research areas and display designs not yet investigated.
5834868725ff05a97b01568b	The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, a validation study on Construct-TM is conducted to show that modeling the actual and cognitive knowledge networks of a group can produce agent interactions within the model that correlate significantly with the communication network obtained from empirical data. Second, empirically grounded theory is produced by combining empirical data with simulation experiments run on empirically validated models.
5834868725ff05a97b013bf6	Compute-intensive applications are emerging in intelligent home, retail store and automotive industries. These applications are becoming more sophisticated with new features rich in audio, video, image, and machine learning capabilities that demand heavy computations. We present the EMERALD (EMERging Applications and algorithms for Low power Device) workload suite. We profile the workloads to show the hotspot functions that are candidates for hardware accelerators.
5834868625ff05a97b011eca	In recent years, Binford's generalized cylinders have become a commonly used shape representation scheme in computer vision. However, research involving generalized cylinders has been hampered by a lack of analytical results at all levels, even including a lack of a precise definition of these shapes. In this paper, a definition is presented for Generalized Cylinders and for several subclasses. Straight Generalized Cylinders, with a linear axis, are important because the natural object-centered coordinates are not curved.
5834868625ff05a97b012964	The Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle in an input directed graph, is among the fundamental problems whose approximability is not well understood. One can efficiently find an O (logn)-factor approximation, and efficient constant-factor approximation is ruled out under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). We give a simpler proof that Feedback Vertex Set is hard to approximate within any constant factor, assuming UGC.
5834868625ff05a97b012f67	Correlation filters take advantage of specific properties in the Fourier domain allowing them to be estimated efficiently: O (ND log D) in the frequency domain, versus O (D^ 3+ ND^ 2) spatially where D is signal length, and N is the number of signals. Recent extensions to correlation filters, such as MOSSE, have reignited interest of their use in the vision community due to their robustness and attractive computational properties. In this paper we demonstrate, however, that this computational efficiency comes at a cost.
5834868725ff05a97b014358	We introduce a statically-typed language extensibility mechanism called active type-checking and translation (AT&T) that aims toward expressiveness, safety and composability. This mechanism allows users to equip type definitions with type-level functions that control the compilation process directly, at points that are relevant to that type's semantics.
5834868625ff05a97b012f05	This special issue is the seventh in an important tradition in the computer architecture community: IEEE Micro's Top Picks from the Computer Architecture Conferences. This tradition, started by IEEE Micro's then editor in chief, Pradip Bose, provides a means for sharing a sample of the best papers published in computer architecture during the past year with the IEEE Micro readership and researchers in the computer architecture community.
5834868625ff05a97b01320b	A differential drive robot is perhaps the simplest type of mobile robot, and the bounded velocity model is perhaps the simplest useful model of the admissible controls. This paper develops the bounded velocity model for differential drive mobile robots, and derives the time-optimal trajectories.
5834868725ff05a97b013748	The large volume of spam e-mail messages sent across the network forms a bottleneck for ISPs and seems to have no benefits to recipients. They are costly in terms of time, and are difficult to manage. However, if senders were charged a price for sending these bulk messages, then the amount of junk communication will be reduced, and senders will be forced to better target their audience since a cost will be incurred for each e-mail message sent.Two experiments were conducted to measure potential benefits to recipients.
5834868625ff05a97b012f36	A system for image manipulation enables an improved video conferencing experience. The system includes a camera; a display screen adjacent to the camera; a processor coupled to the camera and the display screen; and a memory coupled to the processor. Instructions executable by the processor enable receiving a source image from the camera and generating a synthetic image based upon the source image. The synthetic image corresponds to a view of a virtual camera located at the display screen.
5834868625ff05a97b013235	In this article we adapt and further develop a CHRG parsing technique which was initially conceived in the context of grammar induction for Womb Grammars [8]. We also show that applying it to constraint-based linguistic formalisms such as Property Grammars [3] can yield truly direct implementations of specialized parsers that focus on ungrammaticality detection and correction.
5834868725ff05a97b013ef2	In this work, we look at the problem of multi-class image classification in a semi-supervised learning framework. Given a small set of labeled images, and a much larger set of unlabeled images, we propose a semi-supervised learning method based on bootstrapping that uses independent and discriminating evaluators to overcome semantic drift. Results show the usefulness of an evaluator in learning difficult examples.

5834868625ff05a97b012f83	Linear filters are ubiquitously used as a preprocessing step for many classification tasks in computer vision. In particular, applying Gabor filters followed by a classification stage, such as a support vector machine (SVM), is now common practice in computer vision applications like face identity and expression recognition. A fundamental problem occurs, however, with respect to the high dimensionality of the concatenated Gabor filter responses in terms of memory requirements and computational efficiency during training and testing.
5834868625ff05a97b01259e	One of the fundamental goals of artificial intelligence is to understand and develop intelligent agents that simulate human-level intelligence. A lot of effort has been made to develop intelligent agents that simulate human learning of math and science, eg, for use in cognitive tutors. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge for each domain and even for each level of problem difficulty, which hurts the generality of the learning agent and is less cognitively plausible.
5834868625ff05a97b013244	The embodiments disclosed herein relate to various robotic and/or in vivo medical devices having compact joint configurations. Other embodiments relate to various medical device components, including forearms having grasper or cautery end effectors, that can be incorporated into certain robotic and/or in vivo medical devices.
5834868525ff05a97b00f865	This paper presents the development and gait generation of biped robot Stepper-Senior. Parallel double crank mechanism and elastic materials are introduced in the 10 DOF lower limbs to mechanically restrict the sole to contact flat with the ground for stable fast walking. Virtual Slope Walking is used for biped gait generation, which is a simple method with strongly intuitive parameters for real-time utilization. In walking experiment, Stepper-Senior reaches the speed of 0.65 m/s and accomplishes omnidirectional walking.
5834868725ff05a97b015bff	A method to verify a circuit design may include applying a bounded model checking technique to a first computer language representation of the circuit design and to a second computer language representation of the circuit design. The method may also include determining a behavioral consistency between the first and second computer language representations.
5834868725ff05a97b01392e	Despite the large number of failed projects due to unrealistic schedules, their sponsors continue to push for development times that bear no relation to the productivity of their organisations, in the hope that next time things will be different. This paper postulates, that is possible to discriminate a challenging project from a death march one by comparing its footprint or profile to the constraints imposed on it.
5834868625ff05a97b012ee6	We introduce a data structure, analysis, and visualization scheme called a cactus graph for comparing sets of related genomes. In common with multi-break point graphs and A-Bruijn graphs, cactus graphs can represent duplications and general genomic rearrangements, but additionally, they naturally decompose the common substructures in a set of related genomes into a hierarchy of chains that can be visualized as two-dimensional multiple alignments and nets that can be visualized in circular genome plots.
5834868725ff05a97b015c06	We describe the implementation of three symbolic computation algorithms on shared memory multiprocessors. We also evaluate the performance of the implementations, point out some of their common characteristics, and describe why these algorithms should be able to take advantage of the large scale heterogeneous shared memory machines currently being developed.
5834868725ff05a97b013933	Time boxing is a management technique which prioritizes schedule over deliverables but time boxes which are merely a self, or an outside, imposed target without agreed partial outcomes and justified certainty are at best, an expression of good will on the part of the team. This essay proposes the use of a modified set of Moscow rules which accomplish the objectives of prioritizing deliverables and providing a degree of assurance as a function of the uncertainty of the underlying estimates.
5834868625ff05a97b012caf	In this paper, we revise two commonly used saturated functions, the logistic sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent (tanh). We point out that, besides the well-known non-zero centered property, slope of the activation function near the origin is another possible reason making training deep networks with the logistic function difficult to train. We demonstrate that, with proper rescaling, the logistic sigmoid achieves comparable results with tanh.
5834868725ff05a97b013aea	The Engineering community faces a number of issues around its role in the larger CHI community and its contribution to SIGCHI-sponsored conferences. This SIG aims to stimulate discussion and attention on the work of researchers interested in the engineering aspects of HCI. It is the forum to report progress on key issues, identify objectives for the near future, and develop plans to address them.
5834868625ff05a97b0130a2	The Healthy Cities project addresses the lack of publiclyavailable information about city health. Through interviews and surveys of Berkeley residents, we have found that city health includes a wide variety of economic, environmental, and social indicators. We are building public ambient displays that make city health more visible and encourage change by highlighting the value of individual contributions.
5834868725ff05a97b013c0d	In the early phases of the drug discovery process, the current focus is on testing compounds using a variety of assays to detect desired effects on the protein targets. In later phases of development, undesired effects of these compounds are often discovered, but only after significant investment into their development. If possible, it would be preferable to choose compounds in the earlier phases, based on knowledge of the effects of the screened compounds on many different targets.
5834868625ff05a97b0127b9	We describe a new dependency parser for English tweets, TWEEBOPARSER. The parser builds on several contributions: new syntactic annotations for a corpus of tweets (TWEEBANK), with conventions informed by the domain; adaptations to a statistical parsing algorithm; and a new approach to exploiting out-of-domain Penn Treebank data. Our experiments show that the parser achieves over 80% unlabeled attachment accuracy on our new, high-quality test set and measure the benefit of our contributions.
5834868625ff05a97b010fdb	In 1999, the 512-bit number of 155 digits taken from the RSA Challenge list was first factored by the General Number Field Sieve. This work was done on a supercomputer and about 300PCs or workstations by 17 experts all over the world. The calendar time for the factorization was over 6 months. Based on the open source GGNFS, we improved its algorithms and implementations. Now the 512-bit RSA modulus can be factored within 3 days by the high-performance computing resource at National Taiwan University.
5834868725ff05a97b0137e8	Public speaking performances are not only characterized by the presentation of the content, but also by the presenters' nonverbal behavior, such as gestures, tone of voice, vocal variety, and facial expressions. Within this work, we seek to identify automatic nonverbal behavior descriptors that correlate with expert-assessments of behaviors characteristic of good and bad public speaking performances. We present a novel multimodal corpus recorded with a virtual audience public speaking training platform.
5834868625ff05a97b013016	The ability to argue is essential in many aspects of life, but traditional face-to-face tutoring approaches do not scale up well. A solution for this dilemma may be computer-supported argumentation (CSA). The evaluation of CSA approaches in different domains has led to mixed results. To gain insights into the challenges and future prospects of CSA we conducted a survey among teachers, researchers, and system developers. Our investigation points to optimism regarding the potential success and importance of CSA.
5834868725ff05a97b01418b	Sensor nodes are increasingly deployed in many environments. Most of these nodes feature onboard sensor chips to measure environmental data such as humidity, temperature and light. In this paper, we show that seemingly innocuous and non-sensitive data such as humidity measurements can disclose private information such as human presence. We conduct several experiments using Telos motes running TinyOS to justify our claims. research to investigate mechanisms to prevent the leakage of private information.
5834868625ff05a97b013046	An acoustic apparatus includes a first acoustic element, a second acoustic element, and a registration portion. The first acoustic element and the second acoustic element are elements such as a coil, a reed, or a yoke. The registration portion is configured to register the first acoustic element with respect to the second acoustic element such that an exact and relative alignment and positioning between the first acoustic element and second acoustic element is provided and ensured.
5834868625ff05a97b013192	Purpose Lectins are valuable tools for detecting specific glycans in biological samples, but the interpretation of the measurements can be ambiguous due to the complexities of lectin specificities. Here, we present an approach to improve the accuracy of interpretation by converting lectin measurements into quantitative predictions of the presence of various glycan motifs.
5834868725ff05a97b013778	ABSTRACT: There is a need for cognitively bounded implementations of transactive memory \nfor agents. To do this, we use schema theory and tiered social cognition to implement Mead's \nGeneralized Other (1925). We then compared our new implementation, Construct-ML, with a \nprior implementation of the same simulation, Construct- O. We were not able to replicate all of \nthe patterns suggested by Construct-O's results. However, the pattern validity of Construct-ML \nimproves as agents have more cognitive resources, which is suggestive and interesting.
5834868725ff05a97b014c5a	The idea of a retroactive version of a data structure is to maintain a time-ordered sequence of operations while allowing the user to revise the operation sequence by invoking and revoking (ie, inserting and deleting, respectively) operations anywhere in the sequence—including backwards in time. In many applications of retroactivity, operations depend on the outcomes of previous queries, and therefore the data structures need to identify the queries whose outcome changes when a revision is performed retroactively.
5834868625ff05a97b011562	In this paper, we present the design of a new fMRI compatible haptic interface with 3DOFs, based on electrical DC actuation, for the study of brain mechanisms of human motor control. In order to evaluate the validity of the proposed solution, we performed some preliminary experiments with a single degree of freedom device to test the compatibility with the fMRI environment. The 1DOF design was extended...
5834868725ff05a97b0157dd	Application security is a crucial problem in today's technological society. Currently, there does not exist a place for discovering, learning, and testing secure design principles. Fireaxe is the pilot competition that attempts to fill this gap. Two teams, one in New Mexico, and one in California, participated in this trial run. We successfully show that a secure design competition is feasible and useful for teaching and guiding students to implement more secure software.
5834868625ff05a97b012fb0	A multigraph is exactly k-edge-connected if there are exactly k edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices. We characterize the class of exactly 3-edge-connected graphs, giving a synthesis involving two operations by which every exactly 3-edge-connected multigraph can be generated. Slightly modified syntheses give the planar exactly 3-edge-connected graphs and the exactly 3-edge-connected graphs with the fewest possible edges.
5834868725ff05a97b0145a0	We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared translation task. We participated in two language pairs, German–English and Hindi–English. Our innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree transla-tion, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create “synthetic trans-lation options” that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the training data, and a method of combining the out-put of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.
5834868725ff05a97b0137ea	This paper presents a new approach for 3D view registration of stereo images. We introduce a hybrid error function which combines constraints from the ICP (iterative closest point) algorithm and normal flow constraint. This new technique is more precise for small movements and noisy depth than ICP alone, and more robust for large movements than the normal flow constraint alone. Finally, we present experiments which test the accuracy of our approach on sequences of real and synthetic stereo images.
5834868625ff05a97b010ff9	Debugging, albeit useful for software development, is also a double-edge sword since it could also be exploited by malicious attackers. This paper analyzes the prevailing debuggers and classifies them into 4 categories based on the debugging mechanism. Furthermore, as an opposite, we list 13 typical anti-debugging strategies adopted in Windows. These methods intercept specific execution points which expose the diagnostic behavior of debuggers.
5834868625ff05a97b013014	For many practical learning scenarios, the integrated use of more than one learning tool is educationally beneficial. In these cases, interoperability between learning tools–getting the pieces to talk–is a crucial requirement that is often hard to achieve. This paper describes an architecture that aims at the integration of independent learning tools into one collaborative learning scenario.
5834868725ff05a97b0139d3	This paper describes audio-visual speech recognition experiments on a multi-speaker, large vocabulary corpus using the Janus speech recognition toolkit. We describe a complete audio-visual speech recognition system and present experiments on this corpus. By using visual cues as additional input to the speech recognizer, we observed good improvements, both on clean and noisy speech in our experiments.
5834868725ff05a97b015377	The network that local health officials use to communicate about professional issues contains two groups of LHDs that are influential for either their ability to spread information or to innovate. Both groups are more likely to conduct community health assessments and develop health improvement plans. Since these activities are fundamental aspects of accreditation and health reform, the findings may present an early indication that these initiatives are having an effect on the public health system.
5834868725ff05a97b0157e4	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and optical imaging have both undergone impressive technological growth in recent years. A study in which mice learn to modulate neural activity merges these technologies to investigate the neural basis of BCI learning with unprecedented spatial detail.
5834868725ff05a97b014c7c	In this paper, we try to describe the issues to be considered in developing a concatenative speech synthesizer for Amharic language. The complexity of the syllable structure of the language, the phonetic nature of the language and the result of the perceptual test of the synthesizer will be discussed. Comments and recommendations for further research are included.
5834868725ff05a97b0137b1	Similar Segments in Social Speech was one of the Brave New Tasks at MediaEval 2013. The task involves finding segments similar to a query segment, in a multimedia collection of informal, unstructured dialogs among members of a small community.
5834868725ff05a97b013fe8	Asymmetric Chip Multiprocessors (ACMPs) are becoming a reality. ACMPs can speed up parallel applications if they can identify and accelerate code segments that are critical for performance. Proposals already exist for using coarse-grained thread scheduling and fine-grained bottleneck acceleration. Unfortunately, there have been no proposals offered thus far to decide which code segments to accelerate in cases where both coarse-grained thread scheduling and fine-grained bottleneck acceleration could have value.
5834868725ff05a97b014c84	Speech Synthesizers have traditionally been built on carefully read speech that is recorded in studio environment. Such voices are suboptimal for use in noisy conditions, which is inevitable in a majority of deployed speech systems. In this work, we attempt to modify the output of the speech synthesizers to make it more appropriate for noisy environments. Comparison of spectral and prosodic features of speech in noise and results of some conversion techniques are presented.
5834868625ff05a97b01300f	This paper presents the design of forthcoming wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) studies in the context of the EU-funded Metafora project that is developing a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) system to scaffold 12 to 16-year-old students in learning to learn together (L2L2). In the Metafora system, students undertake lengthy collaborative challenges interacting in 3 different spaces: a planning tool, a discussion tool and a domain-specific microworld. In the meantime they are encouraged to reflect on the L2L2 process.
5834868725ff05a97b013fed	Higher level of resource integration and the addition of new features in modern multi-processors put a significant pressure on their verification. Although a large amount of resources and time are devoted to the verification phase of modern processors, many design bugs escape the verification process and slip into processors operating in the field. These design bugs often lead to lower quality products, lower customer satisfaction, diminishing brand/company reputation, or even expensive product recalls.
5834868625ff05a97b0125eb	Researchers and theorists have proposed that feelings of attachment to subgroups within a larger online community or site can increase users' loyalty to the site. They have identified two types of attachment, with distinct causes and consequences. With bond-based attachment, people feel connections to other group members, while with identity-based attachment they feel connections to the group as a whole. In two experiments we show that these feelings of attachment to subgroups increase loyalty to the larger community.
5834868725ff05a97b01439c	In robotics research, perception is one of the most challenging tasks. In contrast to existing approaches that rely only on computer vision, we propose an alternative method for improving perception by learning from human teammates. To evaluate, we apply this idea to a door detection problem. A set of preliminary experiments has been completed using software agents with real vision data. Our results demonstrate that information inferred from teammate observations significantly improves the perception precision.
5834868725ff05a97b01537e	Social media is rapidly becoming one of the mediums of choice for understanding the cultural pulse of a region; eg, for identifying what the population is concerned with and what kind of help is needed in a crisis. To assess this cultural pulse it is critical to have an accurate assessment of who is saying what in social media. However, social media is also the home of malicious users engaged in disruptive, disingenuous, and potentially illegal activity. A range of users, both human and non-human, carry out such social cyber-attacks.
5834868625ff05a97b0128c2	Wikipedia, a wiki-based encyclopedia, has become one of the most successful experiments in collaborative knowledge building on the Internet. As Wikipedia continues to grow, the potential for conflict and the need for coordination increase as well. This article examines the growth of such non-direct work and describes the development of tools to characterize conflict and coordination costs in Wikipedia. The results may inform the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.
5834868625ff05a97b0128f1	A new algorithm enables a fully automatic real-time video segmentation solution for dynamic first-person sports videos. The proposed approach leverages the latest in robust vision-based ego-motion estimation and unsupervised learning using nonparametric Bayesian modeling.
5834868725ff05a97b0153bd	The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University is one of the largest programs of its kind. We present here the initial design and subsequent evolution of our MS and PhD programs in Language Technologies. The motivations for the design and evolution are also presented.
5834868725ff05a97b0153bf	Project Argus addresses the problem of obtaining novel intelligence from large, constantly incrementing collections of structured data like shipping records, financial transfers, or hospital admission records. Structured data already provides intelligence analysts with a huge amount of important information. The ever-increasing capabilities of techniques to discern structure in currently unstructured data like text, image and voice ensure that handling structured data will only become more important for intelligence analysis.
5834868725ff05a97b0153c7	When astronomers analyze sky images, they need to identify the newly observed celestial objects in the catalog of known objects. We have developed a technique for indexing catalogs, which supports fast retrieval of closely matching catalog objects for every object in new images. It allows processing of a sky image in less than a second, and it scales to catalogs with billions of objects.
5834868725ff05a97b013912	The problem of concept learning, or forming a general description of a class of objects given a set of examples and non-examples, is viewed here as a search problem. Existing programs that generalize from examples are characterized in terms of the classes of search strategies that they employ. Several classes of search strategies are then analyzed and compared in terms of their relative capabilities and computational complexities.
5834868725ff05a97b0153ce	Mundane discourse abounds with utterances referring to other utterances. These meta-language utterances appear with surprising frequency in task-oriented dialogues, such as those arising in the context of a natural language interface to an operating system. This paper identifies some simpler types of dialogue-level metalanguage utterance and provides a computational framework to process such phrases in the context of a case-frame parser exploiting strongly-typed domain semantics.
5834868725ff05a97b0153d3	We recently decided to develop a new alignment algorithm for the purpose of improving our Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system's performance, since subsentential alignment is critical in locating the correct translation for a matched fragment of the input. Unlike most algorithms in the literature, this new Symmetric Probabilistic Alignment (SPA) algorithm treats the source and target languages in a symmetric fashion.
5834868725ff05a97b0153d6	We consider the task of scheduling a conference based on incomplete information about resources and constraints, which requires elicitation of additional data, and describe a learning procedure that improves elicitation strategies. We outline the representation of incomplete knowledge, and then describe an adaptive elicitation procedure, which learns to identify critical missing data.
5834868625ff05a97b012948	Differences in perceptual and cognitive abilities between the young and elderly have implications for in-car tasks. As a primary example, although in-car navigation systems enhance situational awareness, this comes at the cost of increasing visual distraction and cognitive load. To address these shortcomings, this paper explores the efficacy of multi-modal cues for providing route guidance information. We present the results of a study evaluating the impact of multi-modal feedback on driving performance and cognitive load.
5834868725ff05a97b0153ea	While many cybersecurity tools are available to computer users, their default configurations often do not match needs of specific users. Since most modern users are not computer experts, they are often unable to customize these tools, thus getting either insufficient or excessive security. To address this problem, we are developing an automated assistant that learns security needs of the user and helps customize available tools.
5834868725ff05a97b0153ee	This study considers the extent to which users with the same query agree as to what is relevant, and how what is considered relevant may translate into a retrieval algorithm and results display. To combine user perceptions of relevance with algorithm rank and to present results, we created a prototype digital library of scholarly literature. We confine studies to one population of scientists (paleontologists), one domain of scholarly scientific articles (paleo-related), and a prototype system (PaleoLit) that we built for the purpose.

5834868625ff05a97b013043	This paper describes our recent progress in Desktop Robotics. It begins with a description of the application domain, and then describes progress in a few areas: a mobile manipulator called the mobipulator, fast prototyping work culminating in the Palm Pilot Robot Kit, and work on time-optimal paths for diff drive robots.
5834868725ff05a97b0143fb	This paper describes a preprocessor for Turkish text that involves various stages of lexical, morphological and multi-word construct processor for preprocessing Turkish text for various language engineering applications. We present the architecture of the system with special emphasis on how various kinds of collocations and other similar multi-word constructs are handled and present an evaluation from a test corpus.
5834868725ff05a97b013c69	KANT (Knowledge-Based, Accurate Natural Language Translation) is a software system which supports the creation of customer-specific applications for fast, accurate translation of controlled source texts in a document production environment without requiring postediting. This short introduction to KANT is intended to describe the KANT software, the kinds of translation tasks it can perform, and the steps necessary to build a KANT application in a particular customer domain.
5834868725ff05a97b014ca4	This paper proposes a novel parameter generation algorithm for high-quality speech generation in Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based speech synthesis. One of the biggest issues causing significant quality degradation is the over-smoothing effect often observed in generated parameter trajectories. Global Variance (GV) is known as a feature well correlated with the over-smoothing effect and a metric on the GV of the generated parameters is effectively used as a penalty term in the conventional parameter generation.

5834868725ff05a97b013c6c	We present an approach to pronominal anaphora resolution using KANT Controlled Language and the KANTOO multilingual MT system. Our algorithm is based on a robust, syntax-based approach that applies a set of restrictions and preferences to select the correct antecedent. We report a success rate of 93.3% on a training corpus with 286 anaphors, and 88.8% on held-out data with 144 anaphors. Our approach translates anaphors to Spanish with 97.9% accuracy and to German with 94.4% accuracy on held-out data.
5834868725ff05a97b013c79	Unstructured information may be defined as the direct product of human communication. Examples include natural language documents, email, speech, images and video. The UIMA specification defines platform-independent data representations and interfaces for software components or services called analytics, which analyze unstructured information and assign semantics to regions of that unstructured information.
5834868625ff05a97b0126d8	Navigation planning for legged robots via foot placement planning has enabled several humanoids to traverse interesting environments autonomously. In this paper we explore methods of adapting foot placement actions to the terrain during the search process, allowing for fuller use of the robot's capabilities, and better resulting paths. We show the results of these adaptive action models for both the humanoid HRP-2 and the quadruped LittleDog.
5834868725ff05a97b014cc0	In this paper we present our activities towards a Thai Speech-to-Speech translation system. We investigated in the design and implementation of a prototype system. For this purpose we carried out research on bootstrapping a Thai speech recognition system, developing a translation component, and building an initial Thai synthesis system using our existing tools.
5834868725ff05a97b014cc9	This paper gives an overview of the present state of the art in speech synthesis and its relationship to spoken output in education systems. The paper specifically looks at the use in general tutorial systems, use in language learning and supporting new languages, and in voice conversion techniques that can produce speech similar to a specific speaker.
5834868725ff05a97b013c82	Most current IR research is focused on specific technologies, such as filtering, classification, entity extraction, question answering, etc. There is relatively little research on merging multiple technologies into sophisticated applications, due in part to the high cost of integrating independently-developed text processing modules.
5834868625ff05a97b012792	By combining algorithmic learning, decision procedures, predicate abstraction, and templates, we present an automated technique for finding quantified loop invariants. Our technique can find arbitrary first-order invariants in the form of the given template and exploits the flexibility in invariants by a simple randomized mechanism. The proposed technique is able to find quantified invariants for sample loops in Linux source code and benchmarks in previous work.
5834868725ff05a97b0141e7	We analyze keystroke latency patterns to identify the person typing on the keyboard. Unlike previous work in this domain, which focused on taking one reference sample and doing user authentication based on the reference sample only, we continuously sample user input and use the data for identi cation and further learning and re nement of the user model.

5834868725ff05a97b0145a3	We describe the CMU submission for the 2014 shared task on language identification in code-switched data. We participated in all four language pairs: Spanish–English, Mandarin–English, Nepali–English, and Modern Standard Arabic–Arabic dialects. After describing our CRF-based baseline system, we discuss three extensions for learning from unlabeled data: semi-supervised learning, word embeddings, and word lists.
5834868625ff05a97b012972	4 Conclusion In the previous sections we showed that the ProPars system by using symbolic procedures is enabled to parse sentences of arbitrary length. In addition, symbolic procedures were used to store intermediate parsing results such that a syntax tree can be assembled after the parsing process has been completed. Both of these problems are not solved by other connectionist based systems.
5834868625ff05a97b0129d2	In this paper, we describe an Automatic Rule Refiner that, given online post-editing information, traces errors back to problematic translation rules and proposes concrete fixes to such rules. Evaluation results on an English-to-Spanish Transfer-based MT system show that this approach generalizes beyond sentences corrected by bilingual speakers to unseen data. We show that by applying automatic refinements, higher translation accuracy can be achieved as measured by automatic evaluation metrics.
5834868725ff05a97b015508	We prove that access to a prior distribution over target functions can dramatically improve the sample complexity of self-terminating active learning algorithms, so that it is always better than the known results for prior-dependent passive learning. In particular, this is in stark contrast to the analysis of prior-independent algorithms, where there are simple known learning problems for which no self-terminating algorithm can provide this guarantee for all priors.
5834868725ff05a97b014726	For users with sensory or mobility impairments the evolution of mobile devices introduces new accessibility issues. For instance, touch screens, lacking tactile cues, are hard to use by blind users without additional feedback. These problems are being mitigated through new interaction paradigms, such as screen readers: software that describe the currently selected elements on the interface through vocal cues.
5834868625ff05a97b0129d5	We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared translation task. We participated in two language pairs, German–English and Hindi–English. Our innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree transla-tion, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create “synthetic trans-lation options” that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the training data, and a method of combining the out-put of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.
5834868725ff05a97b01479e	The goal of this paper is to describe a new approach to a content creation and delivery mechanism for a programming course. This approach is based on the concept of creating a large repository of learning objects, each of which consists of the core material, code examples, supplementary notes, and review questions. A learning object will be uniquely described by a XML document and presents an interface for future search, retrieval and updating, as well as for potential connection to external assessment tools.
5834868725ff05a97b0147a2	The authors aim at deriving a family of series representations for (2в+ 1)(в Gn) by evaluating certain trigonometric integrals in several different ways. They also show how the results presented in this paper relate to those that were obtained in other works. Finally, some illustrative computational examples, using Mathematica (Version 4.0) for Linux, are considered.
5834868725ff05a97b014728	NavCog is a novel smartphone navigation system for people with visual impairments or blindness, capable of assisting the users during autonomous mobility in complex and unfamiliar indoor/outdoor environments. The accurate localization achieved by NavCog is used for precise turn-by-turn way-finding assistance as the first step, but the ultimate goal is to present a variety of location based information to the user, such as points of interest gathered from social media and online geografic information services.
5834868725ff05a97b01472c	For visually impaired users one of the major challenges is unassisted orientation and way-finding, especially in unexplored and potentially dangerous environments. The following work analyzes the issues stemmed from this problem and summarizes the merits and flaws of solutions available in literature. Afterwards, the research methodology is briefly described and the already achieved results are listed. Finally, a roadmap for the future contributions is proposed.
5834868725ff05a97b0159ed	Increasingly, scientific computing applications must accumulate and manage massive datasets, as well as perform sophisticated computations over these data. Such applications call for data-intensive scalable computer (DISC) systems, which differ in fundamental ways from existing high-performance computing systems.
5834868725ff05a97b01472f	Independent mobility involves a number of challenges for people with visual impairment or blindness. In particular, in many countries the majority of traffic lights are still not equipped with acoustic signals. Recognizing traffic lights through the analysis of images acquired by a mobile device camera is a viable solution already experimented in scientific literature. However, there is a major issue: the recognition techniques should be robust under different illumination conditions.
5834868625ff05a97b010f71	Background Stroke is one of the most common disorders among the elderly. A practical problem in stroke rehabilitation systems is that how to separate motor imagery patterns from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. There is a sharp decline in performance of these systems when classical algorithms, such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), are directly applied on stroke patients.
5834868725ff05a97b015223	Trust is viewed as a computational construct capable of being explicitly studied and modeled. Although articulated as a (functional) property of individual agents, the collective effect of events influencing (and being influenced by) trust judgments can impact organizational behavior. In this paper we summarize our work on agent trust and explore a current study on trust, cooperativity, and benevolence of agents and organizational behavior.
5834868725ff05a97b014187	Multi-path routing is effective to enhance network availability, by selecting multiple failure-independent paths for reaching one destination in the hope to survive individual path failures. Researchers suggest to select IP-layer topologically disjoint paths, assuming that they are failure-independent and can hardly fail simultaneously. Unfortunately, failure correlations lurking behind the IP-layer topology can surreptitiously squash availability gained through multi-path routing, because selected paths can fail simultaneously.
5834868725ff05a97b013855	This paper considers the expected number of hyperrectangles corresponding to leaf nodes which will provably need to be searched. Such hyperrectangles intersect the volume enclosed by a hypersphere centered on the query point whose surface passes through the nearest neighbour. For example, in Figure 6.5 the hypersphere (in this 6-9 Figure 6.5 Generally during a nearest neighbour search only a few leaf nodes need to be inspected.
5834868625ff05a97b011707	This paper addresses the problem of identifying likely topics of texts by their position in the text. It describes the automated training and evaluation of an Optimal Position Policy, a method of locating the likely positions of topic-bearing sentences based on genre-specific regularities of discourse structure. This method can be used in applications such as information retrieval, routing, and text summarization.
5834868625ff05a97b013606	Explanation based learning has typically been considered a symbolic learning method. An explanation based learning method that utilizes purely neural network representa-tions (called EBNN) has recently been devel-oped, and has been shown to have several desirable properties, including robustness to errors in the domain theory. This paper briefly summarizes the EBNN algorithm, then explores the correspondence between this neu-ral network based EBL method and EBL methods based on symbolic representations.
5834868725ff05a97b01426b	Sensor networks offer economically viable solutions for a variety of applications. For example, current implementations monitor factory instrumentation, pollution levels, freeway traffic, and the structural integrity of buildings. Other applications include climate sensing and control in office buildings and home environmental sensing systems for temperature, light, moisture, and motion. Sensor networks are key to the creation of smart spaces, which embed information technology in everyday home and work environments.
5834868725ff05a97b014b68	The authors present a new secondary pulse excitation for linear prediction based analysis by synthesis speech coders. The structure of the excitation has been specifically designed to model characteristics in the speech waveform which the LTP memory fails to adequately represent. This is achieved using an excitation vector simply consisting of two pulses.
5834868725ff05a97b0150c7	While Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) online workforce has been characterized by many people as being anonymous, we expose an aspect of AMT's system design that can be exploited to reveal a surprising amount of information about many AMT Workers, which may include personally identifying information (PII). This risk of PII exposure may surprise many Workers and Requesters today, as well as impact current institutional review board (IRB) oversight of human subjects research involving AMT Workers as participants.
5834868725ff05a97b014b93	Subphonetic discovery through segmental clustering is a central step in building a corpus-based synthesizer. To help decide what clustering algorithm to use we employed mergeand-split tests on English fricatives. Compared to reference of 2%, Gaussian EM achieved a misclassification rate of 6%, K-means 10%, while predictive CART trees performed poorly.
5834868725ff05a97b0150e0	Existing statistical approaches to natural language problems are very coarse approximations to the true complexity of language processing. As such, no single technique will be best for all problem instances. Many researchers are examining ensemble methods that combine the output of successful, separately developed modules to create more accurate solutions. This paper examines three merging rules for combining probability distributions: the well known mixture rule, the logarithmic rule, and a novel product rule.
5834868725ff05a97b014d83	Unfortunately, bugs are plentiful. For example, the Ubuntu Linux bug-management database \nlisted more than 103,000 open bugs as of January 2013. Specific widely used programs (such \nas the Firefox Web browser and the Linux 3.x kernel) list 7,597 and 1,293 open bugs in their \npublic bug trackers, respectively. a Other projects, including those that are closed-source, likely \ninvolve similar statistics. These are just the bugs we know; there is always the persistent threat \nof zero-day exploits, or attacks against previously unknown bugs.
5834868725ff05a97b013d7c	Time-lapse live cell imaging has been increasingly employed by biological and biomedical researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms in cell physiology and development by investigating behavior of cells. This trend has led to a huge amount of image data, the analysis of which becomes a bottleneck in related research. Consequently, how to efficiently analyze the data is emerging as one of the major challenges in the fields.

5834868725ff05a97b013b5b	We are designing, implementing, and testing the user interface for RADAR (Reflective Agents with Distributed Adaptive Reasoning), which is a large multi-agent system that uses learning to help office workers cope with email overload and to complete routine tasks more efficiently. RADAR provides a mixed-initiative user interface in which artificial intelligence helps users perform the tasks that arrive in email messages. A large-scale user test of RADAR demonstrated the effectiveness of its user interface and AI.
5834868625ff05a97b012d3d	The rate of donations made by individuals is relatively low in Korea when compared to other developed countries. To address this problem, we propose the DONA, an urban donation motivating robot prototype. The robot roams around in a public space and solicits donation from passers-by by engaging them through a pet like interaction. In this paper, we present the prototype of the robot and our design process.
5834868625ff05a97b012d45	Our research group is designing robotic products and services that will adapt to people's changing behavior through repeated interactions. Through the process of creating these products and services, we have found that there are many dynamic issues to account for in the design: the behavior of customers, the capabilities of the robot, and what the robot knows about people and their preferences. Current service design blueprints are not sufficient for capturing these dynamic relationships among elements of the service.
5834868625ff05a97b012d82	ABSTRACT: The extraction of lip contour features is difficult and computationally expensive. ln this paper we explore the desirable alternative of estimating the contour from area features (ie. mouth grey~ scale image) directly via a non-linear stochastic mapping technique. Results are presented on our own speaker dependent database to demonstrate this method and explain why it performs better than previous techniques.
5834868725ff05a97b0150fe	Correspondence checking formally verifies that a pipelined microprocessor realizes the serial semantics of the instruction set model. By representing the circuit state symbolically with Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), this correspondence checking can be performed directly on a logic-level representation of the circuit. Our ongoing research seeks to make his approach practical for real-life microprocessors.
5834868625ff05a97b01316c	College students learned to solve chemistry stoichiometry problems with a web-based intelligent tutor that provided hints and feedback, using either polite or direct language. There was a pattern in which students with low prior knowledge of chemistry performed better on subsequent problem-solving tests if they learned from the polite tutor rather than the direct tutor (d=. 78 on an immediate test, d=. 51 on a delayed test), whereas students with high prior knowledge showed the reverse trend (d=−. 47 for an immediate test; d=−.
5834868625ff05a97b011ed1	Inferring scene geometry and camera motion from a stream of images is possible in principle, but it is an ill-conditioned problem when the objects are distant with respect to their size. We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion without computing depth as an intermediate step. An image stream can be represented by the 2F x P measurement matrix of the image coordinates of P points tracked through F frames. Under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3.

5834868725ff05a97b014dd2	We propose an automated method to recover the full calibration parameters between a 3D range sensor and a monocular camera system. Our method is not only accurate and fully automated, but also relies on a simple calibration target consisting of a single circle. This allows the algorithm to be suitable for applications requiring in-situ calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a camera-lidar system and show results on 3D mapping tasks.

The imperfection of the as-grown crystals such as constitutional supercooling, dislocation was observed and also eliminated during the growing processes. Color center after ultra-violet irradiation of such crystals has been studied. Ce in this crystal plays a role not only as a sensitizing ion but also as an anti-ultraviolet irradiation element. From the measurement of absorption and fluorescence spectra it can be seen that there exists energy transfer between Ce and Nd.
5834868725ff05a97b014d22	Many people enjoy the social aspects of gaming, but most video games are designed to be played by only one person at a time. We introduce WeGame, a system that increases the sociability of single-player video games by allowing joint co-located play. The WeGame mediation framework flexibly merges the inputs of multiple players into a single control stream before forwarding it to the gaming system in real-time, and supports visual overlays to give players feedback on the newly-injected social dimensions of the game.
5834868725ff05a97b0138d2	The task of learning models for many real-world problems requires incorporating domain knowledge into learning algorithms, to enable accurate learning from a realistic volume of training data. This paper considers a variety of types of domain knowledge for constraining parameter estimates when learning Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider domain knowledge that constrains the values or relationships among subsets of parameters in a Bayesian network with known structure.
5834868725ff05a97b01584f	The concurrent logical framework CLF is an extension of the logical framework LF designed to specify concurrent and distributed languages. While it can be used to define a variety of formalisms, reasoning about such languages within CLF has proved elusive. In this paper, we propose an extension of LF that allows us to express properties of CLF specifications. We illustrate the approach with a proof of safety for a small language with a parallel semantics.
5834868625ff05a97b011483	We present a novel method for solving the challenging problem of generating 3D models of generic object categories from just one single un-calibrated image. Our method leverages the algorithm proposed in [1] which enables a partial reconstruction of the object from a single view. A full reconstruction is achieved in a subsequent object completion stage where modified or state-of-the-art 3D shape and...

Each phrase-pair includes more dependencies, further fragmenting the search space and making MLE estimates unreliable.
5834868725ff05a97b015696	We describe a scheduling system that supports collaboration between the user and automated optimizer. It enables the user to monitor the optimizer decisions, make any of the decisions manually, and leave the other decisions to the system. Furthermore, it identifies the tasks that require the user's participation, and asks for assistance with these tasks.
5834868625ff05a97b0124f0	This paper investigates the effect of meta-cognitive help in the context of learning by teaching. Students learned to solve algebraic equations by tutoring a teachable agent, called SimStudent, using an online learning environment, called APLUS. A version of APLUS was developed to provide meta-cognitive help on what problems students should teach, as well as when to quiz SimStudent. A classroom study comparing APLUS with and without the meta-cognitive help was conducted with 173 seventh to ninth grade students.
5834868625ff05a97b01318e	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.

5834868725ff05a97b013680	Limited memory bandwidth and long access latency are serious GPU performance bottlenecks. For emerging applications that are inherently error resilient, this paper proposes to predict the values of safe-to-approximate loads and drop a certain fraction of the cache misses with predicted values to improve performance and energy efficiency.
5834868725ff05a97b015117	This study compares people's interactions with Embodied Conversational Agents to similar interactions over the phone, and investigates the impact these media have on a wide range of behavioral, task and subjective measures. While the behavioral measures were consistent with previous studies, the subjective measures indicated that the fit of an ECA's persona to the task and style of interaction can overwhelm the effects of media on subjects' assessment of the ECA and the interaction.
5834868725ff05a97b014bf5	Machine Learning Theory, also known as Computational Learning Theory, aims to understand the fundamental principles of learning as a computational process and combines tools from Computer Science and Statistics. This essay is intended to give a very brief introduction to the area, some of its past successes, and some of its current challenges and potential future directions.

5834868725ff05a97b014d39	Attackers commonly exploit buggy programs to break into computers. Security-critical bugs pave the way for attackers to install trojans, propagate worms, and use victim computers to send spam and launch denial-of-service attacks. A direct way, therefore, to make computers more secure is to find security-critical bugs before they are exploited by attackers.
5834868725ff05a97b01456b	The advent of multi-core systems set off a race to get concurrent programming to the masses. One of the challenging aspects of this type of system is how to deal with exceptional situations, since it is very difficult to assert the precise state of a concurrent program when an exception arises. In this paper we propose an exception-handling model for concurrent systems. Its main quality attributes are simplicity and expressiveness, allowing programmers to deal with exceptional situations in a concurrent setting in a familiar way.

5834868725ff05a97b01369f	Instruction-grain lifeguards monitor executing programs at the granularity of individual instructions to quickly detect bugs and security attacks, but their fine-grain nature incurs high monitoring overheads. This article identifies three common sources of these overheads and proposes three techniques that together constitute a general-purpose hardware acceleration framework for lifeguards.
5834868725ff05a97b014c12	This reading list gives pointers to papers on various parallel programming languages. It is meant to be representative and is certainly not complete. We have tried to place each language in a category where we think it fits best. Others are welcome to disagree with our choices. For each class we give an annotated list of readings. Three papers that give somewhat of an overview of parallel languages are [Sch93, Per92, BST89, Bal92].
5834868725ff05a97b013bd8	Techniques for reliable communication in an on-chip network of a multi-core processor are provided. Packets are tagged with tags that define reliability requirements for the packets. The packets are routed in accordance with the reliability requirements. The reliability requirements and routing using them can ensure reliable communication in the on-chip network.
5834868725ff05a97b015188	Teams and organizations often need to be transformed in order to work more efficiently or to achieve certain goals. In this paper, we propose a computational analysis framework, inspired by image morphing, to study the transformation of an organization so that the cost for the transformation is minimized. We also present a visualization tool to illustrate the transformation process.
5834868725ff05a97b013802	We present a discriminative latent variable model for classification problems in structured domains where inputs can be represented by a graph of local observations. A hidden-state conditional random field framework learns a set of latent variables conditioned on local features. Observations need not be independent and may overlap in space and time.
5834868725ff05a97b0156ad	We describe a crowdsourcing system, called SmartNotes, which detects security threats related to web browsing, such as Internet scams, deceptive sales of substandard products, and websites with intentionally misleading information. It combines automatically collected data about websites with user votes and comments, and uses them to identify potential threats. We have implemented it as a browser extension, which is available for free public use.
5834868725ff05a97b0152ad	It has been observed in many instances that markets have a tendency to segment themselves into distinct sub-markets. This paper presents a multi-agent model that illustrates emergent market segmentation. The model illustrates the way local optimization processes result in an emergent global behavior.

5834868725ff05a97b0152b7	Distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks have emerged as a prevalent way to compromise the availability of networks/servers, which imposed financial losses for e-commerce businesses. Many defenses that mitigate the effect of ongoing DDOS attacks have been proposed. However, none of the defenses have been widely deployed on the Internet infrastructure at this point because of a lack of understanding in the economic incentives inherent in providing the defenses as well as uncertainty in current defenses.
5834868725ff05a97b0152ba	Computer models and analyses of past flu outbreaks indicate that there is a role for community-wide intervention--such as isolating infected people or voluntary quarantine--to control illnesses and deaths during the next pandemic flu, says a new report from the Institute of Medicine. It adds, however, that government and community leaders should not overstate the certainty about their effectiveness.

5834868725ff05a97b0154f1	We consider the task of identifying and labeling the semantic arguments of a predicate that evokes a FrameNet frame. This task is challenging because there are only a few thousand fully annotated sentences for supervised training. Our approach augments an existing model with features derived from FrameNet and PropBank and with partially annotated exemplars from FrameNet. We observe a 4% absolute increase in F1 versus the original model.
5834868725ff05a97b0158fb	Building a collaborative trusting relationship with users is crucial in a wide range of applications, such as advice-giving or financial transactions, and some minimal degree of cooperativeness is required in all applications to even initiate and maintain an interaction with a user. Despite the importance of this aspect of human–human relationships, few intelligent systems have tried to build user models of trust, credibility, or other similar interpersonal variables, or to influence these variables during interaction with users.
5834868725ff05a97b0154fa	We present a system for indexing large sets of records, and retrieving exact and approximate matches for a given query. We define records, queries, and matches between them, describe an indexing structure for fast identification of exact and approximate matches, and give results of testing the system on a database of hospital patients.
5834868625ff05a97b012a9a	We develop a new paradigm for designing fully streaming, area-efficient FPGA implementations of common building blocks for vision algorithm. By focusing on avoiding redundant computation we achieve a reduction of one to two orders of magnitude reduction in design area utilization as compared to previous implementations. We demonstrate that our design works in practice by building five 325 frames per second, high resolution Harris corner detection cores onto a single FPGA.
5834868625ff05a97b012a9c	A pedestrian tracking system using inertial sensors mounted on both feet is presented. Significant accuracy improvements are demonstrated, compared to single shoe tracking, by using sonar foot-to-foot range measurements to constrain heading drift. A single complementary Kalman filter fuses data from both inertial measurement units and the sonar sensor. The system is composed of commercial and custom hardware. Experimental results collected over long durations and distances are presented.
5834868725ff05a97b0154fd	This paper reports the experiments of using Indri for the main and routing (relevance feedback) tasks in the TREC 2007 Legal Track. For the main task, we analyze ranking algorithms using different fields, boolean constraints and structured operators. Evaluation results show that structured queries outperform bag-of-words ones. Boolean constraints improve both precision and recall. For the routing task, we train a linear SVM classifier for each topic. Terms with the largest weights are selected to form new queries.
5834868725ff05a97b0159aa	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development. and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868725ff05a97b0154f0	In this paper we present a method to improve the automatic detection of events in short sentences when in the presence of a large number of event classes. Contrary to standard classification techniques such as Support Vector Machines or Random Forest, the proposed Fuzzy Fingerprints method is able to detect all the event classes present in the ACE 2005 Multilingual Corpus, and largely improves the obtained G-Mean value.
5834868625ff05a97b0129b8	Motivation: While text mining technologies for biomedical research have gained popularity as a way to take advantage of the explosive growth of information in text form in biomedical papers, selecting appropriate natural language processing (NLP) tools is still difficult for researchers who are not familiar with recent advances in NLP. This article provides a comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art natural language parsers, focusing on the task of extracting protein–protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical papers.
5834868725ff05a97b0147a5	The multiple Barnes function, defined as a generalization of the Euler gamma function, is used in many applications of pure and applied mathematics and theoretical physics. This paper presents new integral representations as well as special values of the Barnes function. Moreover, the Barnes function is expressed in a closed form by means of the Hurwitz zeta function. These results can be used for numeric and symbolic computations of the Barnes function.
5834868725ff05a97b015b69	We described stacked graphical learning, a meta-learning scheme in which a base learner is augmented by expanding one instance's features with predictions on other related instances. The stacked graphical learning is efficient, especially during inference, capable of capturing dependencies easily, and can be constructed based on any kind of base learner. In experiments on two classification problems, stacked graphical learning generally achieved comparable accuracy to other graphical models via much faster inference.
5834868725ff05a97b014b4e	In this paper we present our argument that context information could be used in early stages ie, during the definition of mapping of the words into sequence of graphemes. We show that the early tagged contextual graphemes play a significant role in improving the performance of grapheme based speech synthesis and speech recognition systems.
5834868725ff05a97b0136c4	A processor capable of executing prefetching instructions containing hint fields is provided. The hint fields contain a first portion which enables the selection of a destination indicator for refill operations, and a second portion which identifies a destination. The portion of the hint field identifying a destination may be applied to consistently direct streamed and retained data to select portions of a cache. As a result, one type of data (eg, retained) is lees likely to be replaced by another type of data (eg, streamed) and vice versa.
5834868725ff05a97b0156f8	We show a reduction to propositional logic from a Boolean combination of inequalities of the form Vi is greater or equal Vj+ C and Vi is less than Vj+ C where C is a constant, and Vi, Vj are variables of type real or integer. Equalities and uninterpreted functions can be expressed in this logic as well. We discuss the advantages of using this reduction as compared to competing methods, and present experimental results that support our claims.
5834868725ff05a97b015300	When astronomers analyze sky images, they need to identify the newly observed celestial objects in the catalog of known objects. We have developed a technique for indexing of astronomical catalogs, which supports fast retrieval of matching catalog objects for every object in new images. It allows processing of a sky image in less than a second, and it scales to catalogs with billions of objects.
5834868725ff05a97b015307	The discrete channel apodization method to unfold detected x-ray energy spectra is derived for a detector with a Gaussian response function. Other processes required to determine the true source spectrum at the top of the atomosphere are described. A successful computer implementation, with sample results of the spectral determination process, including the discrete channel apodization method, is presented.
5834868725ff05a97b013966	This paper presents a decentralized controller to guide a group of aerial robots to converge to and to move along a simple closed curve specified in a three-dimensional environment. This curve may be considered as a perimeter to be surveilled by the robots. The solution presented in this paper is based on an artificial vector field modulated by a collision avoidance scheme and relies only on local sensing. Proofs of asymptotic stability of the proposed controller are devised for a team of kinematically controlled rotorcrafts.

5834868625ff05a97b01363f	Abstract—Laughter is an important non-verbal human social signal. Clarifying the mechanism of laughing would be useful in a variety of studies on health or sociology. In this paper we introduce a non-invasive multisensory system for real-time laughter detection and analysis. We focus only on the audio laughter recognition, present the preliminary results we obtained, and discuss the possible application of this system in the medical field.
5834868725ff05a97b014bb7	Semi-supervised learning [1, 4, 5, 8, 12] refers to the problem of using a large unlabeled data set U together with a given labeled data set L in order to generate prediction rules that are more accurate on new data than would have been achieved using just L alone. Semi-supervised learning is motivated by the fact that in many settings (eg, document classification, image classification, speech recognition), unlabeled data is plentiful but labeled data is more limited or expensive, eg, due to the need for human labelers.

The polynomial model mapping is applied to other low resolution images to obtain corresponding higher resolution images. The mapping provides resolution enhancement which is superior to that of conventional image data interpolation techniques.

Three learning models are compared. By using SVM classifier with neighbor features and pruning tree to phrase level we achieve significantly better speed and accuracy than state of the art Chinese SRL systems.

It allows the user to place pre-defined Garnet gadgets in a window and then save them to a file. There are two versions: one for Garnet look-and-feel gadgets and one for Motif look-and-feel gadgets.
5834868725ff05a97b015b7f	In this paper, we argue that many Automatic Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) tasks which have previously been addressed separately can be viewed as instances of single abstract problem: multiview semi-supervised learning with an incomplete class hierarchy. We also present a general EM framework for solving this abstract task, and summarize past work on various special cases of multiview semi-supervised exploratory learning.

SDG is a class of applications that support multiple simultaneous users interacting in a co-present environment on a single shared display with multiple input-devices. SDG are being used in various applications in the educational, entertainment and research communities, but many issues remain to be explored.
5834868725ff05a97b013a70	A 2D geometric interpretation of regions will prove helpful. Any region [b, e] can be regarded as a point in the plane, where the x-coordinate indicates the start of the region and the y-coordinate indicates the end. We refer to this two-dimensional interpretation of regions as region space (see Figure 5). Strictly speaking, only points with integral coordinates correspond to regions, and even then only if they lie above the 45-degree line, where b<= e.
5834868625ff05a97b013166	Schemas are cognitive knowledge structures that serve to consistently bias our interpretations of events. Some of these schemas are derived early in the developmental process, and some of these early schemas provide maladaptive interpretations of events. In other words, some of these schemas typically lead to distorted preconceptions, invalid assumptions, and unrealistic goals and expectations.
5834868725ff05a97b0150ed	Website privacy policies often contain ambiguous language that undermines the purpose and value of privacy notices for site users. This paper compares the impact of different regulatory models on the ambiguity of privacy policies in multiple online sectors. First, the paper develops a theory of vague and ambiguous terms. Next, the paper develops a scoring method to compare the relative vagueness of different privacy policies. Then the theory and scoring are applied using natural language processing to rate a set of policies.
5834868725ff05a97b0157b1	Automated segmentation of pigmented skin lesions (PSLs) from dermoscopy images is an important step for computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. The segmentation task involves classifying each image pixel as either lesion or skin. It is challenging because lesion and skin can often have similar appearance. We present a novel exemplar-based algorithm for lesion segmentation which leverages the context provided by a global color model to retrieve annotated examples which are most similar to a given query image.
5834868725ff05a97b015140	This technical report summarizes the demographics and Socially Observed Linked Opinion (SOLO) dataset, which came out of the Social Media ACTion study that took place at Carnegie Mellon during the summer of 2015. 124 individuals rated 4,320 social media posts and 1,680 news clips along the three dimensions used in Affect Control Theory.

5834868725ff05a97b0157b4	Respective sets of motion vectors are computed for pairs of image frames. The computed motion vectors are classified into motion classes. Motion clusters are identified in the image frames based at least in part on the motion classes. An identified motion cluster is selected as a motion stabilization reference based on spatiotemporal consistency of the selected motion cluster across multiple image frames.

5834868725ff05a97b013a76	Many dynamic programming language features, such as implicit declaration, reflection, and code generation, make it difficult to verify the existence of identifiers through standard program analysis. We present an alternative verification, which, rather than analyzing the semantics of code, highlights any name or pair of names that appear only once across a program's source files. This uniqueness heuristic...
5834868725ff05a97b015ba7	Despite the fact that we now have access to almost all peer reviewed publications on the Web, these publications appear to us in a linear form which is a replica of print journals. At the same time there are increasingly attractive opportunities to surface data and concepts directly on the web, using semantic organization. This talk will discuss how—for biomedical researchers—the web of documents and the web of data/concepts can be bridged and integrated, using the Domeo Web Annotation Toolkit and the Annotation Ontology (AO).
5834868725ff05a97b0147a6	The multiple gamma function Γ n, defined by a recurrence-functional equation as a generalization of the Euler gamma function, was originally introduced by Kinkelin, Glaisher, and Barnes around 1900. Today, due to the pioneer work of Conrey, Katz and Sarnak, interest in the multiple gamma function has been revived. This paper discusses some theoretical aspects of the Γ n function and their applications to summation of series and infinite products.

5834868725ff05a97b015a08	Abstract—It is impractical to verify multiplier or divider circuits entirely at the bit-level using ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), because the BDD representations for these functions grow exponentially with the word size. It is possible, however, to analyze individual stages of these circuits using BDDs. Such analysis can be helpful when implementing complex arithmetic algorithms. As a demonstration, we show that Intel could have used BDDs to detect erroneous lookup table entries in the Pentium (TM) floating point divider.
5834868725ff05a97b0157b9	CONTEXT: There is an increasing concern about chronic low-level pesticide exposure during childhood and its influence on childhood cancers. OBJECTIVE: In this meta-analysis, we aimed to examine associations between residential childhood pesticide exposures and childhood cancers. DATA SOURCES: We searched all observational studies published in PubMed before February 2014 and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches.
5834868725ff05a97b013bee	In existing systems, the off-chip memory interface allows the memory controller to perform only read or write operations. Therefore, to perform any operation, the processor must first read the source data and then write the result back to memory after performing the operation. This approach consumes high latency, bandwidth, and energy for operations that work on a large amount of data. Several works have proposed techniques to process data near memory by adding a small amount of compute logic closer to the main memory chips.
5834868725ff05a97b01370f	A derivational approach to learning and design, based on the notion of reusing a design by “replaying” an idealized history of design goals and decisions, has been touted for the past few years as a paradigm for both software and hardware redesign. However, the limited success of this approach to date suggests that it is less straightforward than it appears. Closer study reveals some difficulties that intelligent replay mechanisms will need to address.
5834868725ff05a97b013e76	A methodology is presented for component-based machine translation (MT) evaluation through causal error analysis to complement existing global evaluation methods. This methodology is particularly appropriate for knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) systems. After a discussion of MT evaluation criteria and the particular evaluation metrics proposed for KBMT, we apply this methodology to a large-scale application of the KANT machine translation system, and present some sample results.
5834868725ff05a97b013720	A common program optimization strategy is to eliminate recomputation by caching and reusing results. We analyze the problems involved in automating this strategy: deciding which computations are safe to cache, transforming the rest of the program to make them safe, choosing the most cost-effective ones to cache, and maintaining the optimized code. The analysis extends previous work on caching by considering side effects, shared data structures, program edits, and the acceptability of behavior changes caused by caching.

5834868625ff05a97b01252a	Open collaborative authoring systems such as Wikipedia are growing in use and impact. This research examines how to create a collaborative authoring community for educational resources. We describe and evaluate a novel tool for community authoring of worked examples, in the task of making instruction for a specific math skill. Participants were professional teachers (math and non-math) and amateurs. We find that while there are differences by teaching status, all three groups made contributions of worth.
5834868625ff05a97b011b03	This paper presents a convenient self-calibration method for an inertial measurement unit (IMU) using matrix factorization. Using limited information about applied loads (accelerations or angular rates) available from natural references, the proposed method can linearly solve all the parameters of an IMU in any configuration of its inertial components. Our factorization-based calibration method exploits the bilinear form of an IMU measurement, which is the product of intrinsic calibration parameters and exerted loads.
5834868625ff05a97b012a63	We report on techniques for using discourse context to reduce ambiguity and improve translation accuracy in a multi-lingual (Spanish, German, and English) spoken language translation system. The techniques involve statistical models as well as knowledge-based models including discourse plan inference. This work is carried out in the context of the Janus project at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Karlsruhe.
5834868725ff05a97b01481c	Many applications need to respond to incremental modifications to data. Being incremental, such modification often require incremental modifications to the output, making it possible to respond to them asymptotically faster than recomputing from scratch. In many cases, taking advantage of incrementality therefore dramatically improves performance, especially as the input size increases. As a frame of reference, note that in parallel computing speedups are bounded by the number of processors, often a (small) constant.
5834868725ff05a97b014bde	Problems of clustering data from pairwise similarity information arise in many different fields. Yet questions of which algorithms are best to use under what conditions, and how good a similarity measure is needed to produce accurate clusters for a given task remains poorly understood. In this work we propose a new general framework for analyzing clustering from similarity information that directly addresses this question of what properties of a similarity measure are sufficient to cluster accurately and by what kinds of algorithms.

5834868625ff05a97b013319	We use Hidden Process Models (HPMs) to evaluate different models of a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study in which subjects decide whether stimuli match. We demonstrate the ability of HPMs to simultaneously estimate the hemodynamic response functions and the onset times of a set of cognitive processes underlying an fMRI time series, and to compare different models in a principled way.
5834868725ff05a97b014095	Bafilomycin A1 (baf), a specific inhibitor of vacuolar proton ATPases, is commonly employed to demonstrate the requirement of low endosomal pH for viral uncoating. However, in certain cell types baf also affects the transport of endocytosed material from early to late endocytic compartments. To characterize the endocytic route in HeLa cells that are frequently used to study early events in viral infection, we used 35 S-labeled human rhinovirus serotype 2 (HRV2) together with various fluid-phase markers.
5834868725ff05a97b014cce	This paper describes CMU SIN, a new database of speech in noise that can be used for unit selection speech synthesis. We describe a process that can be used to elicit speech in noise and how to use that as part of building a synthetic voice that speaks in noise. Details of the database we constructed, as well as some preliminary analysis and future goals of this work, are also included.
5834868625ff05a97b011699	When offloading computation from a mobile device, we show that it can pay to perform additional on-device work in order to reduce the offloading workload. We call this offload shaping, and demonstrate its application at many different levels of abstraction using a variety of techniques. We show that offload shaping can produce significant reduction in resource demand, with little loss of application-level fidelity.
5834868725ff05a97b0151d1	Observations of Team X at JPL were made on two occasions: February 11-12, 2003 and April 22-25, 2003. The February observation was the CMU team only and met the objective of introduction to the Team X process. The April data collection effort was coordinated with Stanford University and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. All modeling was completed using the data collected from the April collaborative effort. The model data collection focused on the Team X CSSR mission design.
5834868625ff05a97b013324	Much progress has been made in recent years in the area of information retrieval, in particular as embodied in Internet search engine technology. Much progress has also been made in probabilistic, graph-theoretic AI. What are the possibilities for bringing these two lines of research together—for viewing large-scale information retrieval as a core enabling technology for AI systems, and for asking IR systems to exhibit true inferential capabilities? Jordan will discuss research aimed at bridging the AI/IR gap.
5834868625ff05a97b011fb0	Interfaces and delegation are fundamental concepts in OO languages. Although both concepts have been shown to be beneficial in software development, sometimes their implementation is cumbersome. Both result in numbers of forwarding methods or numbers of empty methods for respective classes. These trivial methods distract the user from non-trivial methods the class comprises. This increases complexity and decreases maintainability. In its current form, Java does not provide sufficient mechanisms to avoid this boilerplate code.
5834868625ff05a97b0114a3	We summarize recent machine translation (MT) research at the Information Sciences Institute of USC, and we describe its application to the development of a Japanese-English newspaper MT system. Our work aims at scaling up grammar-based, knowledge-based MT techniques. This scale-up involves the use of statistical methods, both in acquiring effective knowledge resources and in making reasonable linguistic choices in the face of knowledge gaps.
5834868625ff05a97b0114b5	Although vast amounts of textual data are freely available, many NLP algorithms exploit only a minute percentage. In this paper, we study the challenges of working at the terascale and survey reasons why researchers are not fully utilizing available resources. As a case study, we present a terascale algorithm for mining is-a relations that achieves better performance as compared to a state-of-the-art linguistically-rich method.
5834868725ff05a97b01558a	To preserve precious memories of life, people record a vast amount of video using movie cameras and camcorders. Recently, many digital cameras implemented video capture functionality as well, capturing video up to VGA resolution. In a few years, compact digital cameras will be able to capture hours of high definition digital video.
5834868625ff05a97b011b16	This paper presents the principle, structure and performance of a newly developed MR-compatible force sensor. It employs a new optical micrometry that enables highly accurate and highly sensitive displacement measurement. The sensor accuracy is better than 1.0%, and the maximum displacement of the detector is about 10/spl mu/m for a range of the applied force from 0 to 6 N.
5834868725ff05a97b0148be	Disclosed here are methods, systems, paradigms and structures for determining fraudulent content in a social network. The methods include identifying a plurality of users of the social network who perform a plurality of tasks within the social network in a lockstep manner. In the method, the plurality of users are determined to be performing a given task in the lockstep manner when the plurality of users each perform the given task within a predefined duration of time, where the predefined duration of time is associated with the given task.
5834868725ff05a97b01380b	This paper describes a statistical approach to improving the performance of stochastic search algorithms for optimization. Given a search algorithm A, we learn to predict the outcome of A as a function of state features along a search trajectory. Predictions are made by a function approximator such as global or locally-weighted polynomial regression; training data is collected by Monte-Carlo simulation. Extrapolating from this data produces a new evaluation function which can bias future search trajectories toward better optima.
5834868725ff05a97b014cd0	To build a natural sounding speech synthesis system, it is essential that the text processing component produce an appropriate sequence of phonemic units corresponding to an arbitrary input text. In this paper we discuss our efforts in addressing the issues of Font-to-Akshara mapping, pronunciation rules for Aksharas, text normalization in the context of building text-to-speech systems in Indian languages.
5834868725ff05a97b014452	We present the issues that we have encountered in designing a treebank architecture for Turkish along with rationale for the choices we have made for various representation schemes. In the resulting representation, the information encoded in the complex agglutinative word structures are represented as a sequence of inflectional groups separated by derivational boundaries. The syntactic relations are encoded as labeled dependency relations among segments of lexical items marked by derivation boundaries.
5834868625ff05a97b013348	Research by members of the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers, and by their collaborators, is organized within the Laboratory for Computer Science research (LCSR). AI and AI-related applications are the major area of research within LCSR, with about forty people-faculty, staff and graduate students-currently involved in various aspects of AI research.
5834868725ff05a97b0144c9	Metacognitive theories point out that self-assessment can facilitate in-depth reflection and help direct effective self-regulated learning. Yet, not much work has investigated the relationship between students' self-assessment and learning outcomes in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). This paper investigates this relationship with classrooms using the Geometry Cognitive Tutor. We designed a skill diary that helps students take advantage of the tutor's open learner model to periodically self-assess their geometry skill.
5834868625ff05a97b0134c2	For 20+ years, Project LISTEN (www. cs. cmu. edu/~ listen) has made computers listen to children read aloud, and help them learn to read. Along the way we have learned lessons about children, reading, speech technology, intelligent tutors, educational data mining, and doing AIED research in schools.
5834868725ff05a97b0155c0	Indexing is generally viewed as an implementation artifact, indispensable to speed up the execution of logic programs and theorem provers, but with little intrinsically logical about it. We show that indexing can be given a justification in proof theory on the basis of focusing and linearity. We demonstrate this approach on predicate indexing for Horn clauses and several formulations of hereditary Harrop formulas. We also show how to refine this approach to discriminate on function symbols as well.
5834868725ff05a97b0148d9	A complete approach to self-contained evolvable hardware, called self-evolving hardware, is presented. Selfevolving hardware implements the entire evolutionary process and reconfigurable area inside a single FPGA. Unlike previous hardware implementations, self-evolving hardware is capable of evolving both logic and connectivity at run-time. Self-evolving hardware increases the speed, flexibility, and scalability of the evolutionary process, facilitating the implementation of complex circuits.
5834868725ff05a97b0148ce	Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses, that propagate over a social or other network. Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition: if a user buys product'A'(or gets infected with virus' X'), she will never buy product'B'(or virus' Y'). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers.
5834868625ff05a97b0134a3	1 This paper addresses the problem of generating good example contexts to help children learn vocabulary. We construct candidate contexts from the Google N-gram corpus. We propose a set of constraints on good contexts, and use them to filter candidate example contexts. We evaluate the automatically generated contexts by comparison to example contexts from children's dictionaries and from children's stories. 1.
5834868725ff05a97b0155c9	In this extended abstract, we consider a subproblem of AC1 unification [2, 4] applied to multisets [3], where the expressions being unified mention at most one multiset variable. This extends the unification problem of lists in Prologlike languages with commutativity. We give an upper bound to the number of solutions and outline an algorithm for their generation. This problem emerged in an attempt to automate the verification of the Group Diffie-Hellman cryptographic protocol [1], where an attacker may combine expressions of the form gx1...

5834868625ff05a97b011fc8	GNU Autotools is a widely used build tool in the open source community. As open source projects grow more complex, maintaining their build systems becomes more challenging, due to the lack of tool support. In this paper, we propose a platform to build support tools for GNU Autotools build systems. The platform provides an abstraction of the build system to be used in different analysis techniques.
5834868725ff05a97b014d7a	Developers use cryptographic APIs in Android with the intent of securing data such as passwords and personal information on mobile devices. In this paper, we ask whether developers use the cryptographic APIs in a fashion that provides typical cryptographic notions of security, eg, IND-CPA security. We develop program analysis techniques to automatically check programs on the Google Play marketplace, and find that 10.327 out of 11,748 applications that use cryptographic APIs--88% overall--make at least one mistake.
5834868625ff05a97b0114e9	This paper describes BEwTE (Basic El ements with Transformations for Evalua tion), an automatic system for summa rization evaluation. BEwTE is a new, more sophisticated implementation of the BE framework that uses transformations to match BEs (minimallength syntacti cally wellformed units) that are lexically different yet semantically similar. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BEwTE using DUC and TAC datasets.
5834868625ff05a97b011fd3	This appendix presents detailed information about the research methods we used in the study, subject characterization, grounded theory process that we followed strictly, and the survey we performed in the study. It provides helpful data for understanding the subtler points of the companion paper and for reproducibility.
5834868725ff05a97b014d80	Different implementations of the same protocol specification usually contain deviations, ie, differences in how they check and process some of their inputs. Deviations are commonly introduced as implementation errors or as different interpretations of the same specification. Automatic discovery of these deviations is important for several applications. In this paper, we focus on automatic discovery of deviations for two particular applications: error detection and fingerprint generation.
5834868725ff05a97b014d8d	Timing attacks are usually used to attack weak computing devices such as smartcards. We show that timing attacks apply to general software systems. Specifically, we devise a timing attack against OpenSSL. Our experiments show that we can extract private keys from an OpenSSL-based web server running on a machine in the local network. Our results demonstrate that timing attacks against network servers are practical and therefore security systems should defend against them.
5834868625ff05a97b0114ee	To support rule-writers, we are developing techniques to automatically analyze large number of public comments on proposed regulations. A document is analyzed in various ways including argument structure, topics, and opinions. The individual results are integrated into a unified output. The experiments reported here were performed on comments submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency in response to their proposed rule for mercury regulation.
5834868725ff05a97b014d9a	The UQ RoboRoos have been developed to participate in the RoboCup'98 robot soccer small size league. This paper describes the current level of implementation of the robots, including aspects of hardware design, as well as the software running on the robots and the controlling computer. Key features of the RoboRoos design include the agile and powerful mechanical frame, the robots' navigational techniques and a coordinating planner system based on potential field methods.
5834868625ff05a97b0134c3	Knowledge tracing (KT) is widely used in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to measure student learning. Inexpensive portable electroencephalography (EEG) devices are viable as a way to help detect a number of student mental states relevant to learning, eg engagement or attention. This paper reports a first attempt to improve KT estimates of the student's hidden knowledge state by adding EEG-measured mental states as inputs. Values of learn, forget, guess and slip differ significantly for different EEG states.
5834868725ff05a97b013cfc	This article provides an overview of the capabilities that we are developing as part of the Pebbles research project for wireless handheld devices such as mobile phones and palm-size computers like Palm Organizers and PocketPCs. Instead of just being used as a phone or organizer, handheld devices can also be used as remote controls for computers and household and office appliances.
5834868725ff05a97b0138b1	We study how CPS technology can help improve freeway traffic by combining local car GPS positioning, traffic center control decisions, and communication to achieve more tightly coupled feedback control in intelligent speed adaptation. We develop models for an intelligent speed adaptation that respects variable speed limit control and incident management. We identify safe ranges for crucial design parameters in these systems and, using the theorem prover KeYmaera, formally verify safety of the resulting CPS models.
5834868625ff05a97b013411	We are developing a Learning Apprentice System (LAS) that partially automates the initial construction of a rule-based performance program from first principle domain knowledge and assists in refining the performance program's rules during routine use. A simple implementation has been constructed that demonstrates the feasibility of building such a system.
5834868625ff05a97b013413	A major obstacle to widespread proliferation of knowledge-based systems is the cost of software development and maintenance. For example, the XCS system used by Digital to configure computers has a staff of approximately 60 people who maintain and update the knowledge base used by this system (Barker & O'Conner, 1989). While the overhead of development and maintenance is worth the cost for this particular application, there are many other potential applications where high costs prohibit its use.

5834868625ff05a97b011507	Researchers have studied pervasive computing in many domains, but few are as complex as the home. Decades of early-adopter use of smart home technologies have blazed the path and highlighted numerous research challenges. Today, the long-standing vision of pervasive computing, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things, is finally starting to come to fruition in people's homes. The articles in this special issue showcase the diverse range of research in domestic pervasive computing.

5834868725ff05a97b014dad	The development of cheap robot platforms with on-board vision remains one of the \nkey challenges that robot builders have yet to surmount. In this paper we describe the prototype \ndevelopment of a low cost (<US$1000), on-board vision based, robot platform that has been \nused in robot soccer competitions as a test of its capabilities. The robot platform, named the VIPER \nrobot, represents an integration of state of the art embedded technology to produce a robot that \nhas reasonable computational abilities without compromising its size, cost or versatil- ity.
5834868625ff05a97b012a79	This paper describes a working two-way speech-to-speech translation system that runs in near real-time on a consumer handheld computer. It can translate from English to Arabic and Arabic to English in the domain of medical interviews. We describe the general architecture and frameworks within which we developed each of the components: HMM-based recognition, interlingua translation (both rule and statistically based), and unit selection synthesis.
5834868725ff05a97b014df7	This paper describes the two Story Link Detection systems Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed, and examines why their performance on the evaluation data was considerably worse than expected while performance on an alternate evaluation set matched the performance on the training data.
5834868725ff05a97b0148a1	We introduce Egalitarian Paxos, a new distributed consensus algorithm that achieves three goals:(1) optimal commit latency in the wide-area when tolerating one and two failures, under realistic conditions;(2) uniform load balancing across all replicas (thus achieving high throughput); and (3) graceful performance degradation and uninterrupted availability when replicas are slow or crash.
5834868725ff05a97b014e00	We recently decided to develop a new alignment algorithm for the purpose of improving our Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system's performance, since subsentential alignment is critical in locating the correct translation for a matched fragment of the input. Unlike most algorithms in the literature, this new Symmetric Probabilistic Alignment (SPA) algorithm treats the source and target languages in a symmetric fashion.
5834868725ff05a97b014e0e	By adopting a “first-things-first” approach we overcome a number of challenges inherent in developing NLP Systems for resource-scarce languages. By first gathering the necessary corpora and lexicons we are then enabled to build, for Mapudungun, a spelling-corrector, morphological analyzer, and two Mapudungun-Spanish machine translation systems; and for Quechua, a morphological analyzer as well as a rule-based Quechua-Spanish machine translation system.
5834868725ff05a97b014a16	Debates about the ef cient use of radio spectrum are beset by a fundamental conundrum: although unlicensed spectrum has fostered tremendous innovation, is it plagued by a potential tragedy of the commons in which unfettered access renders it useless. There is disagreement if such tragedies occur and what, if anything can be done in technology and policy to delay or defuse such an effect. Surprisingly, given the heat of the debates, current evidence of a tragedy in the wireless commons is mostly anecdotal.
5834868725ff05a97b014e1e	In data-driven Machine Translation approaches, like Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT)(Brown, 2000) and Statistical Machine Translation (Vogel et al., 2003), the quality of the translations produced depends on the amount of training data available. While more data is always useful, a large training corpus can slow down a machine translation system. We would like to selectively sample the huge corpus to obtain a sub-corpus of most informative sentence pairs that would lead to good quality translations.
5834868625ff05a97b011e99	We present the concept that for uniformly rotated images, the optimal approximation of the images can be obtained by computing the basis vectors for the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the original image in polar coordinates, and that the images can be represented as linear combinations of the basis vectors.
5834868725ff05a97b015614	Rapport has been identified as an important factor in human task performance. Motivated by the proliferation of virtual agents that assist humans on various tasks, we propose a computational architecture for virtual agents, building on our own work on a dyadic model of rapport between humans and virtual agents. We show how such a system can be trained in order to build, maintain and destroy rapport.
5834868725ff05a97b015882	CLF (the Concurrent Logical Framework) is a language for specifying and reasoning about concurrent systems. Its most significant feature is the first-class representation of concurrent executions as monadic expressions. We illustrate the representation techniques available within CLF by applying them to an asynchronous pi-calculus with correspondence assertions, including its dynamic semantics, safety criterion, and a type system with latent effects due to Gordon and Jeffrey.
5834868725ff05a97b0149d0	There has been much interest in the machine learning and algorithmic game theory communities on understanding and using submodular functions. Despite this substantial interest, little is known about their learnability from data. Motivated by applications, such as pricing goods in economics, this paper considers PAC-style learning of submodular functions in a distributional setting. A problem instance consists of a distribution on {0, 1} n and a real-valued function on {0, 1} n that is non-negative, monotone, and submodular.
5834868725ff05a97b015883	We present results from a recent project analyzing Kerberos 5. The main expected properties of this protocol, namely confidentiality and authentication, hold throughout the protocol. Our analysis also highlights a number of behaviors that do not follow the script of the protocol, although they do not appear harmful for the principals involved. We obtained these results by formalizing Kerberos 5 at two levels of detail in the multiset rewriting formalism MSR and by adapting an inductive proof methodology pioneered by Schneider.
5834868725ff05a97b014566	Plaid is a research programming language with a focus on typestate, permissions, and concurrency. Typestate describes ordering constraints on method calls to an object; Plaid incorporates typestate into both its object model and its type system. Permissions, incorporated into Plaid's type system and runtime, describe whether a reference can be aliased and whether aliases can change that reference. Permissions support static typestate checking, but they also allow Plaid's compiler to automatically parallelize Plaid code.
5834868725ff05a97b014e24	Since subsentential alignment is critically important to the translation quality of an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system which operates by finding and combining phrase-level matches against the training examples, we recently decided to develop a new alignment algorithm for the purpose of improving the EBMT system's performance. Unlike most algorithms in the literature, this new Symmetric Probabilistic Alignment (SPA) algorithm treats the source and target languages in a symmetric fashion.

5834868725ff05a97b014d2c	Cognitive disabilities are the least understood and the least discussed type of disability among web developers [1]. Some work has explained how developers should create web contents that could be accessible to people with cognitive disabilities [1-4]. While these guidelines are definitely a valuable first step toward making the web more accessible to people with disabilities, the task of creating accessible content is increasingly falling to content creators who are not programmers and are unaware of accessibility guidelines.
5834868725ff05a97b013e5f	The three lexicons used by KBMT-89 are described: A concept lexicon constitutes the sublanguage domain model for specifying semantic information; it is maintained by Ontos, a knowledge-acquisition and maintenance system. An analysis lexicon is a dictionary containing syntactic information and mapping rules required for semantic parsing. And a generation lexicon, similar to the analysis lexicon, is employed in the generation phase.
5834868725ff05a97b01499e	Problems of clustering data from pairwise similarity information arise in many different fields. Yet questions of which algorithms are best to use under what conditions, and how good a similarity measure is needed to produce accurate clusters for a given task remains poorly understood. In this work we propose a new general framework for analyzing clustering from similarity information that directly addresses this question of what properties of a similarity measure are sufficient to cluster accurately and by what kinds of algorithms.
5834868725ff05a97b014e85	As new technology challenges our assumptions about security and privacy, lawmakers respond by attempting to curb and avoid the most egregious risks to the public. In this article, the authors examine how emerging US security and privacy laws create new requirements that constrain software development affecting business owners and developers who want to design security and privacy into IT systems.
5834868725ff05a97b015ac8	The most expensive phase of software development is testing, often consuming over half the budget of a software project. A study by NIST [1] has estimated that software defects cost $60 billion a year in the US economy alone. Unfortunately, test generation is a traditionally manual process.
5834868625ff05a97b012892	In this paper we describe TouchViz, an information visualization system for tablets that encourages rich interaction, exploration, and play through references to physical models. TouchViz turns data into physical objects that experience forces and respond to the user. We describe the design of the system and conduct a user study to explore its use, finding that it supports many different models of data exploration and encourages users to have fun exploring data.
5834868725ff05a97b01585b	We present the calculus xdLLF− and experiment with aspects of its meta-theory. xdLLF− integrates linear explicit substitutions in de Bruijn notation into the simply-typed fragment of the linear logical framework LLF. After observing that the expected σ-rules invalidate subject reduction, we devise a specification of σ-normalization inspired by the big-step semantics of programming languages, and prove it correct.
5834868725ff05a97b013e80	The paper presents a lightweight knowledge-based reasoning framework for the JAVELIN open-domain Question Answering (QA) system. We propose a constrained representation of text meaning, along with a flexible unification strategy that matches questions with retrieved passages based on semantic similarities and weighted relations between words.
5834868725ff05a97b0149f7	We describe CMU LTI's participation in the KBP 2015 Event Track. We officially participated in Task 1: Event Nugget Detection track and Task 3: Event Coreference track. Our system rank high in both tracks. We found that our combined system is competitive but have room to improve. In addition, we have conducted follow up experiments by creating a simple piplined system, and We found it competitive comparing to the official submissions.

5834868725ff05a97b014a06	In this paper we present X-MAC, a low power MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Standard MAC protocols developed for duty-cycled WSNs such as BMAC, which is the default MAC protocol for TinyOS, employ an extended preamble and preamble sampling. While this “low power listening” approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the long preamble introduces excess latency at each hop, is suboptimal in terms of energy consumption, and suffers from excess energy consumption at nontarget receivers.
5834868725ff05a97b014a8e	When offloading computation from a mobile device, we show that it can pay to perform additional on-device work in order to reduce the offloading workload. We call this offload shaping, and demonstrate its application at many different levels of abstraction using a variety of techniques. We show that offload shaping can produce significant reduction in resource demand, with little loss of application-level fidelity.
5834868725ff05a97b0143d3	We use educational data mining to arrive at models of help-seeking behaviors associated with learning from datasets from three countries: Costa Rica, the Philippines, and the USA. The models were then tested on each country's data to find out how effective help-seeking behavior varies across countries. This study found that models of effective help-seeking are not necessarily transferrable across specific pairs of cultures.
5834868725ff05a97b013d56	A traditional Network-on-Chip (NoC) employs simple arbitration strategies, such as round robin or oldest first, which treat packets equally regardless of the source applications' characteristics. This is suboptimal because packets can have different effects on system performance. We define slack as a key measure for characterizing a packet's relative importance. Aérgia introduces new router prioritization policies that exploit interfering packets' available slack to improve overall system performance and fairness.
5834868725ff05a97b014a02	Despite considerable theoretical and computational work on coreference, deciding when two entities or events are identical is very difficult. In a project to build corpora containing coreference links between events, we have identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none). Event coreference annotation on two corpora was performed to validate the findings.
5834868725ff05a97b014a2f	The Network Testbed Mapping Problem is the problem of mapping an emulated network into a test cluster such as Emulab or DETER. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Network Testbed Mapping Problem is NP-complete when there is constrained bandwidth between cluster switches. We demonstrate that the problem is trivial when bandwidth is unconstrained, and note that a number of new proposals for data center networking have removed this barrier. Finally, we consider new heuristics in the bandwidth-limited case.

One goal might be to set up an organization that can efficiently handle crises without impinging on its efficiency to maintain a global ready state during long periods of peacetime activity.
5834868725ff05a97b014906	Background Latent HIV-1 reservoirs are identified as one of the major challenges to achieve HIV-1 cure. Currently available strategies are associated with wide variability in outcomes both in patients and CD4+ T cell models. This underlines the critical need to develop innovative strategies to predict and recognize ways that could result in better reactivation and eventual elimination of latent HIV-1 reservoirs.
5834868725ff05a97b015698	In data-driven Machine Translation approaches, like Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT)(Brown, 2000) and Statistical Machine Translation (Vogel et al., 2003), the quality of the translations produced depends on the amount of training data available. While more data is always useful, a large training corpus can slow down a machine translation system. We would like to selectively sample the huge corpus to obtain a sub-corpus of most informative sentence pairs that would lead to good quality translations.
5834868625ff05a97b011518	This paper investigate security of graphical authentication tokens against educated guess attacks. Results of two user studies indicate that, if we use original photos as authentication tokens, the authentication tokens are vulnerable to educated guess attacks. The results also demonstrate that we can mitigate the vulnerability using distorted pictures.

5834868725ff05a97b014a5b	TCP Incast plagues scalable cluster-based storage built atop standard TCP/IP-over-Ethernet, often resulting in much lower client read bandwidth than can be provided by the available network links. This paper reviews the Incast problem and discusses potential application-level approaches to avoiding it.
5834868725ff05a97b015b08	Hardware description languages (HDLs) are used today to describe circuits at all levels. In large HDL programs, there is a need for source code reduction techniques to address a myriad of problems in design, simulation, testing, and formal verification. Program slicing is a static program analysis technique that allows an analyst to automatically extract portions of programs relevant to the aspects being analyzed. We extend program slicing to HDLs, thus allowing for automatic program reduction to let the user focus on relevant code portions.
5834868725ff05a97b014a7c	This paper presents AIP (Accountable Internet Protocol), a network architecture that provides accountability as a first-order property. AIP uses a hierarchy of self-certifying addresses, in which each component is derived from the public key of the corresponding entity. We discuss how AIP enables simple solutions to source spoofing, denial-of-service, route hijacking, and route forgery. We also discuss how AIP's design meets the challenges of scaling, key management, and traffic engineering.
5834868725ff05a97b014ec1	Abstract—Similarity searching has a vast range of applications in various fields of computer science. Many methods have been proposed for exact search, but they all suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are, thus, not applicable to high dimensional spaces. Approximate search methods are considerably more efficient in high dimensional spaces. Unfortunately, there are few theoretical results regarding the complexity of these methods and there are no comprehensive empirical evaluations, especially for non-metric spaces.

5834868725ff05a97b014f56	External regret compares the performance of an online algorithm, selecting among N actions, to the performance of the best of those actions in hindsight. Internal regret compares the loss of an online algorithm to the loss of a modified online algorithm, which consistently replaces one action by another.
5834868725ff05a97b013fa2	One of the most difficult aspects of creating graphical, direct manipulation user interfaces is managing the relationships between the graphical objects on the screen and the application data structures that they represent. Coral (Constraint-based Object-oriented Relations And Language) is a new user interface toolkit under development that uses efficiently-implemented constraints to support these relationships. Using Coral, user interface designers can construct interaction techniques such as menus and scroll bars.
5834868725ff05a97b014f8a	In a threading mechanism, a system and method for providing automatic value inheritance when a parent thread creates a child thread. Upon thread creation, the system iterates over all of the inheritable thread-local values associated with a parent thread and initializes a child's values of these inheritable thread-local values, based on an appropriate child value method. The child's values may be a copy of the parent's values, or a predetermined function of the parent's values.
5834868725ff05a97b0139a9	Opinion Question Answering (Opinion QA) is still a relatively new area in QA research. The achieved methods focus on combining sentiment analysis with the traditional Question Answering methods. Few attempts have been made to expand opinion questions with external background information. In this paper, we introduce the broad-mining and deep-mining strategies. Based on these two strategies, we propose four methods to exploit Wikipedia and Yahoo! Answers for enriching representation of questions in Opinion QA.
5834868625ff05a97b012038	Prosopagnosia is a cognitive deficit in which patients are impaired at recognizing faces. There is considerable debate as to whether the part of the brain that is damaged in patients with prosopagnosia is substantially dedicated to face recognition or whether it is a locus for identification of similar objects within more general classes. This debate is an instance of a controversy between advocates of a modular view of brain function and those who hold that brain activity should be understood as distributed across a network of locations (Ishai et al.

5834868725ff05a97b0144f7	In this paper we discuss the motivation for a novel style of tutorial dialogue system that emphasizes reflection in a design context by engaging students in negotiation dialogues. Our current research focuses on the hypothesis that negotiation-style dialogue will lead to better learning than previous tutorial dialogue systems because (1) it motivates students to explain more in order to justify their thinking, and (2) it supports the students' meta-cognitive ability to ask themselves the right questions about the choices they make.
5834868725ff05a97b014090	Dramatic advances in methods for protein tagging and the development of fully automated microscopes enable collection of unprecedented volumes of image data on the subcellular location of proteins in live cells. Combining these approaches with machine learning methods promises to provide systematic, high-resolution pattern information on a proteome-wide basis.
5834868725ff05a97b014e2c	We describe an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) system and the adaptations and enhancements made to create a Chinese-English translation system from the Hong Kong legal code and various other bilingual resources available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

5834868725ff05a97b014e41	Since MT systems, whatever translation method they employ, do not reach an optimum output on free text; each method handles some problems better than others. The PANGLOSS Mark III system is an MT environment that uses the best results from a variety of independent MT systems or engines working simultaneously within a single framework on the same text. This paper describes the method used to combine the outputs of the engines into a single text.
5834868625ff05a97b01209b	Certain image properties, such as parallelisms, symmetries, and repeated patterns, provide cues for perceiving the 3-D shape from a 2-D picture. This paper demonstrates how we can map those image properties into 3-D shape constraints by associating appropriate assumptions with them and by using appropriate computational and representational tools. We begin with the exploration of how one specific image property,“skewed symmetry”, can be defined and formulated to serve as a cue to the determination of surface orientations.
5834868725ff05a97b0140d5	Parking availability notification and parking spot locator are two useful VANET applications. In this paper, we provide a network model through which the available parking lots and parking spots can be located efficiently and without extensive infrastructure support. The various security vulnerabilities of the model are noted and an appropriate security architecture is proposed.
5834868725ff05a97b014e49	The authors extend existing supervised-learning and unsupervised-clustering algorithms to allow document classification based on the information content and temporal aspects of news events.

A DIND consists of three basic elements, the sensor to monitor the dynamic environment of the DIND (which contains people, vehicles and robots, etc.), the processor (computer) to process the captured information and the communication device to provide the cooperation of different DINDs through a network.
5834868725ff05a97b014e4a	Imperfect-information games, where players have private information, pose a unique challenge in artificial intelligence. In recent years, Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker, a popular version of poker, has emerged as the primary benchmark for evaluating game-solving algorithms for imperfectinformation games. We demonstrate a winning agent from the 2016 Annual Computer Poker Competition, Baby Tartanian8.
5834868725ff05a97b0140ee	The SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-generation Networks) inter-domain network architecture was proposed to address the availability, scalability, and security shortcomings of the current Internet. This paper presents a retrospective of the SCION goals and design decisions, its attacker model and limitations, and research highlights of work conducted in the 5 years following SCION's initial publication.
5834868725ff05a97b014e58	Tech startups typically approach requirements gathering differently from the process that is used to develop requirements in existing businesses and for existing products. Many of these startups operate in “stealth mode”, taking care to minimize the number of people with whom they share their innovative ideas. It's common for these startups to create a succession of early releases, and...
5834868725ff05a97b0150ee	Natural Language is the general norm for representing requirements in industry. Such representation of requirements cannot be subjected to automated reasoning and is, often, ambiguous and inconsistent. Structuring the natural language requirements can significantly improve reasoning the requirements as well as reusing them in related future projects. We present a novel automated approach to utilize Grammatical Knowledge Patterns for structuring the natural language requirements in the form of Frames.

5834868725ff05a97b0150f5	This symposium responds to calls for an integration of in-vivo and in-vitro methods when studying how people tackle complex, open-ended issues in the areas of creativity, design, and innovation. Bringing together expertise from multiple perspectives and methodological backgrounds we explore fruitful ways towards integrative approaches to analyzing creative processes and practices. The theme is addressed from theoretical and practical viewpoints.

5834868725ff05a97b014eef	We report the results of our work on automating the transliteration decision of named entities for English to Arabic machine translation. We construct a classification-based framework to automate this decision, evaluate our classifier both in the limited news and the diverse Wikipedia domains, and achieve promising accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate a reduction of translation error and an improvement in the performance of an English-to-Arabic machine translation system.
5834868725ff05a97b013f16	In murky water, the light interaction with the medium particles results in a complex image formation model that is hard to use effectively with a shape estimation framework like Photometric Stereo. All previous approaches have resorted to necessary model simplifications that were though used arbitrarily, without describing how their validity can be estimated in an unknown underwater situation. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of such simplified models and we show that this varies strongly with the imaging conditions.
5834868725ff05a97b014ef1	In this paper, we describe the CMUQ system we submitted to The ANLP-QALB 2014 Shared Task on Automatic Text Correction for Arabic. Our system combines rule-based linguistic techniques with statistical language modeling techniques and machine translationbased methods. Our system outperforms the baseline and reaches an F-score of 65.42% on the test set of QALB corpus. This ranks us 3rd in the competition.
5834868725ff05a97b014ef5	In this article, we analyse the modifications available in the French Wikipedia revision history. We define a typology of modifications based on a detailed study of WiCoPaCo, a freely-available resource built by automatically mining Wikipedia's revision history. Based on this typology, we detail a manual annotation study of a subpart of the corpus aimed at assessing the difficulty of automatic paraphrase identification in such a corpus. Finally, we assess a rule-based paraphrase identification tool.

5834868725ff05a97b014151	When it comes to bootstrapping trust in computers, there appear to be significant limitations on the types of guarantees that can be offered against software and hardware attacks. We summarize these limitations below to alert practitioners to the dangers and to inspire more research in these areas.
5834868725ff05a97b014152	The Trusted Computing Group is actually a successor organization (formed in 2003) to the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA). Balacheff et al. document the design of the v1. 1b13 TPM as it emerged from the TCPA era [17]. Note that the v1. 1b TPM does not include any support for dynamic root of trust (Section 5.2), and indeed, the only platform change required to support v1. 1b was BIOS support for the Core Root of Trust for Measurement (CRTM).
5834868725ff05a97b014157	Knowing what code is executing on a platform does not necessarily translate into knowing whether that code can be trusted. In this section, we elaborate on this problem (5.1) and then review solutions that fall into two broad categories: solutions that provide only the identity of security-relevant code (5.2), and those that convey higher-level information (5.3).
5834868725ff05a97b014176	Security plays a critical role in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). In the absence of secure mechanisms, malicious parties could inject bogus information, at best robbing VANETs of their safety benefits or at worst causing accidents. Unfortunately, VANETs pose unique new research challenges, preventing the use of existing network security mechanisms.
5834868725ff05a97b014194	In source-based path selection, the sender chooses the path to the destination from a set of available paths and embeds the forwarding information in the packets. Future Internet proposals have employed this scheme to realize the benefits of source routing without the inherent scalability problems of path computation at the source. Furthermore, to address the security concerns of packet-carried forwarding state, these proposals leverage cryptographic primitives (eg, Message Authentication Codes) per packet in the data plane.
5834868725ff05a97b014e80	Privacy policies describe high-level goals for corporate data practices; regulators require industries to make available conspicuous, accurate privacy policies to their customers. Consequently, software requirements must conform to those privacy policies. To help stakeholders extract privacy goals from policies, we introduce a semiautomated framework that combines crowdworker annotations, natural language typed dependency parses, and a reusable lexicon to improve goal-extraction coverage, precision, and recall.
5834868625ff05a97b0120c6	Vastdigital librariesof information will soon be available on the nation'sInformation Superhighway as a result of emerging technologies for multimedia computing. These libraries wiU profoundly impact the conduct of business, professional, andpersonal activity. However, it is not enough to simply store and play back video (ss in currently envisioned commercial video-on-demand services); to be most effective, new technology is needed for searching through these vast data collections and retrieving the most relevant selections.
5834868725ff05a97b014e8c	Government laws and regulations impose legal requirements on information practices in healthcare and finance. These requirements govern the use and disclosure of information across organizations and their business practices. To comply with the law, organizations must demonstrate that they have verifiable procedures in-place to implement these requirements. This paper surveys our experiences acquiring business process models expressed in the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) using a systematic method.
5834868725ff05a97b01419a	Physical cash is vulnerable to rising threats, such as large-scale, government-mandated forgeries, that digital cash may protect against more effectively. We study mechanisms to combine physical cash with digital cash to remove their respective shortcomings and obtain their combined advantages. We discuss initial mechanisms and examine their cost and benefit trade-offs.
5834868725ff05a97b015139	ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization's design structure. The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resources, and tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. ORA contains over 50 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect.
5834868625ff05a97b012105	A process called “actuarial prejudice” is discussed. Actuarial prejudice is a cognitive bias, based on available information about a group from the past and the present, that causes individuals to expect inferior performance from persons who belong to the group. The process, in part, explains why both women and men expect relatively low achievement from women and why women are less likely to achieve than are men. Hypotheses are proposed for future research to test the implications of this process.
5834868625ff05a97b012112	86% of adult internet users have taken steps from time to time to avoid surveillance by other people or organizations when they were using the internet. Despite their precautions, 21% of online adults have had an email or social media account hijacked and 11% have had vital information like Social Security numbers, bank account data, or credit cards stolen—and growing numbers worry about the amount of personal information about them that is available online.
5834868725ff05a97b013a0d	In this paper, we describe the “Spoken Web Search” Task, which is being held as part of the 2013 MediaEval campaign. The purpose of this task is to perform audio search in multiple languages and acoustic conditions, with very few resources being available for each individual language. This year the data contains audio from nine different languages and is much bigger in size than in previous years, mimicking realistic low/zero-resource settings.
5834868725ff05a97b0154d0	In this paper, we describe an Automatic Rule Refiner that, given online post-editing information, traces errors back to problematic translation rules and proposes concrete fixes to such rules. Evaluation results on an English-to-Spanish Transfer-based MT system show that this approach generalizes beyond sentences corrected by bilingual speakers to unseen data. We show that by applying automatic refinements, higher translation accuracy can be achieved as measured by automatic evaluation metrics.
5834868625ff05a97b0129a8	We describe our submission to the NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge consisting of 4 metrics-two versions of meteor, m-bleu and m-ter. We first give a brief description of Meteor. That is followed by descriptino of m-bleu and m-ter, enhanced versions of two other widely used metrics bleu and ter, which extend the exact word matching used in these metrics with the flexible matching based on stemming and Wordnet in Meteor.
5834868725ff05a97b014784	This tutorial is intended as an introduction to symbolic summation within Mathematica. It will talk about possibilities of the package AlgebraSymbolicSum. The tutorial will not assume detailed knowledge of the Mathematica system, but knowledge of the mathematics is needed.
5834868725ff05a97b0159a6	Parsing spoken input introduces serious problems not present in parsing typed natural language. In particular, indeterminacies and inaccuracies of acoustic recognition must be handled in an integral manner. Many techniques for parsing typed natural language do not adapt well to these extra demands. This paper describes an extension of semantic caseframe parsing to restricted-domain spoken input. The semantic caseframe grammar representation is the same as that used for earlier work on robust parsing of typed input.
5834868725ff05a97b0159a7	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868625ff05a97b0129b0	In the area of parsing spontaneous speech, most work so far has primarily focused on dealing with texts within a narrow, well-de ned domain. The main reasons behind this restriction have been to avoid having to maintain very large and complex grammars on the one hand, and large semantic knowledge sources on the other hand.

What happens when every person has a handheld that ubiquitously communicates with every appliance in the environment? As part of the Pebbles project, we are exploring technologies that allow handhelds to monitor and control appliances.
5834868625ff05a97b01212d	Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, most people lived in close proximity to the places they worked—on farms, above stores and cafés, in back rooms of schools, and in boarding houses. Co-workers were often members of the family, companions and neighbours. With the rise of modern technology—electrification, motorised transportation, communication systems—and the growing importance of the bureaucratic work organisation, the separation between work and personal life grew more definite.
5834868725ff05a97b013a6c	When certain relational operators are intersected, the resulting region set can be larger than the user anticipates. For example, the expression starts with R, ends with S matches every possible pair of R and S, even if other R's and S's occur in between. For situations where only adjacent pairs are desired, any relational operator can be modified by the keyword delimiter. For example, starts with delimiter S matches regions that start with some region matching S and overlap no other region matching S.

5834868725ff05a97b014f28	We present an algorithm that gives a constant factor approximation for the following problem. Given a set of n points in the plane with a Euclidean distance metric and an integer k< n, find the tree of least weight that spans k points. If desired, one may also specify in the problem a “root vertex” that must be in the tree. Our result improves on the previous best bound of O (log k) of Garg and Hochbaum[5], which in turn improved a previous 0 (kl/4) bound of Ravi et al [9].
5834868725ff05a97b014f2a	We consider $ k $-median clustering in finite metric spaces and $ k $-means clustering in Euclidean spaces, in the setting where $ k $ is part of the input (not a constant). For the $ k $-means problem, Ostrovsky et al. show that if the optimal $(k-1) $-means clustering of the input is more expensive than the optimal $ k $-means clustering by a factor of $1/\\epsilon^ 2$, then one can achieve a $(1+ f (\\epsilon)) $-approximation to the $ k $-means optimal in time polynomial in $ n $ and $ k $ by using a variant of Lloyd's algorithm.
5834868725ff05a97b014f2b	Most machine learning algorithms are lazy: they extract from the training set the minimum information needed to predict its labels. Unfortunately, this often leads to models that are not robust when features are removed or obscured in future test data. For example, a backprop net trained to steer a car typically learns to recognize the edges of the road, but does not learn to recognize other features such as the stripes painted on the road which could be useful when road edges disappear in tunnels or are obscured by passing trucks.
5834868625ff05a97b011683	Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical investigations. However, the gap between dropout's training and inference phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis.
5834868725ff05a97b013a97	Plain text has less explicit structure than HTML, so text constraints for plain text typically refer to delimiters like punctuation marks and line breaks. Consider the following example of processing email messages. Several airlines distribute weekly email announcing low-price airfares. An excerpt from one message (from US Airways) is shown in Figure 7.
5834868625ff05a97b011697	Effortless one-touch capture of video is a unique capability of wearable devices such as Google Glass. We use this capability to create a new type of crowd-sourced system in which users receive queries relevant to their current location and opt-in preferences. In response, they can send back live video snippets of their surroundings. A system of result caching, geolocation and query similarity detection shields users from being overwhelmed by a flood of queries.
5834868725ff05a97b013a98	The text constraints engine can evaluate an operator at a typical rate of 20,000 regions per \nsecond, using Symantec JIT 3.0 on a 133 MHz Pentium. The actual evaluation time of a text constraint \nexpression varies according to the complexity of the expression and the size of its intermediate \nresults. The text constraint expressions used in the examples in Section 5 were all evaluated \nin less than 0.1 second, on text files and web pages ranging up to 80KB in size.
5834868725ff05a97b014f3f	We present simple semidefinite programming relaxations for the m-hard minimum bandwidth and minimum length linear ordering problems. We then show how these relaxations can be rounded in a natural way (via random projection) to obtain new approximation guarantees for both of these vertex-ordering problems.
5834868725ff05a97b013a9a	This section describes the implementation of text constraints used in LAPIS. Among the interesting \nfeatures of the implementation is a novel region set representation, the region interval. Region \nintervals are particularly good at representing the result of a region relation operator. By a simple \ntransformation, region intervals may be regarded as rectangles in two-dimensional space, allowing \nLAPIS to draw on earlier research in computational geometry to find a data structure suitable \nfor storing and combining collections of region intervals.
5834868725ff05a97b01450d	We combined two existing methods for rapid tutor development:“plug-in tutor agents”[6] and an authoring tool suite (CTAT) that supports the creation of tutors “by demonstration”[2]. The combined approach, which has not been tried before, is suited for adding tutoring capabilities to an existing problem-solving environment, for example an off-the-shelf simulator. Connecting the components (ie, the simulator and CTAT) requires programming but once that is done,“Pseudo Tutors” are created “by demonstration.
5834868725ff05a97b014547	We demonstrate a static analysis for extracting instance-based hierarchical views showing the runtime object graph for object-oriented programs. The code is annotated with ownership domain annotations and with additional annotations to make the output more visually appealing.
5834868725ff05a97b014548	Flexible ownership domain annotations can express and enforce design intent related to encapsulation and communication in real-world object-oriented programs. Ownership domain annotations also provide an intuitive and appealing mechanism to obtain a sound visualization of a system's execution structure at compile time. The visualization provides design intent, is hierarchical, and thus more scalable than existing approaches that produce mostly nonhierarchical raw object graphs.
5834868725ff05a97b01454e	Maintaining the conformance of an implementation to its architecture is difficult in practice since developers often make changes that degrade the architectural structure. We present tools for statically checking the structural conformance of a system to its runtime architecture.
5834868725ff05a97b013d30	Limited memory bandwidth and long access latency are serious GPU performance bottlenecks. For emerging applications that are inherently error resilient, this paper proposes to predict the values of safe-to-approximate loads and drop a certain fraction of the cache misses with predicted values to improve performance and energy efficiency.
5834868725ff05a97b014eed	In this paper, we present a novel way of tackling the monolingual alignment problem on pairs of sentential paraphrases by means of edit rate computation. In order to inform the edit rate, information in the form of subsentential paraphrases is provided by a range of techniques built for different purposes. We show that the tunable TER-PLUS metric from Machine Translation evaluation can achieve good performance on this task and that it can effectively exploit information coming from complementary sources.
5834868625ff05a97b0116c0	This paper describes a summarization system for technical chats and emails on the Linux kernel. To reflect the complexity and sophistication of the discussions, they are clustered according to subtopic structure on the sub-message level, and immediate responding pairs are identified through machine learning methods. A resulting summary consists of one or more mini-summaries, each on a subtopic from the discussion.
5834868625ff05a97b0116c2	In this paper, we show that we can obtain a good baseline performance for Question Answering (QA) by using only 4 simple features. Using these features, we contrast two approaches used for a Maximum Entropy based QA system. We view the QA problem as a classification problem and as a re-ranking problem. Our results indicate that the QA system viewed as a re-ranker clearly outperforms the QA system used as a classifier. Both systems are trained using the same data.
5834868725ff05a97b013aad	Although visual shells (eg, Apple Macintosh) are easy to use, they are difcult to program, especially by non-expert users. PURSUIT is a visual shell that contains a programming by demonstration (PBD) system to address this problem. In a PBD system, users execute actions on data and the underlying system attempts to construct a program. Such systems, however, have limitations: feedback is often di cult to understand, disruptive or non existent; and programs often have no representation for users to examine or edit.
5834868625ff05a97b012179	We present a stereo vision-aided inertial navigation system and demonstrate its potential in power line inspection at close range using an unmaned aerial vehicle. This is made possible by recent developments in visual odometry and a newly proposed algorithm for the loose coupling of an inertial measurement unit and visual odometry. Our experiments show promising results.
5834868725ff05a97b014f59	We show how the results of Karger, Motwani, and Sudan (1994) and Blum (1994) can be combined in a natural manner to yield a polynomial-time algorithm for O ̃ (n 3 14)-coloring any n-node 3-colorable graph. This improves on the previous best bound of O ̃ (n 1 4) colors (Karger et al., 1994).
5834868625ff05a97b0116e3	Multi-document person name resolution focuses on the problem of determining if two instances with the same name and from different documents refer to the same individual. We present a two-step approach in which a Maximum Entropy model is trained to give the probability that two names refer to the same individual. We then apply a modified agglomerative clustering technique to partition the instances according to their referents.

5834868725ff05a97b014645	In order to make progress on Intelligent Tutoring in ill-defined domains it is helpful to start with a definition. In this paper we consider the existing definitions and select one for the basis of our discussion. We then summarize some of the more salient characteristics of ill-defined domains from a tutoring standpoint and some human and ITS strategies that have been employed to cope with them. We conclude with some challenges to the ITS community to spur further research.
5834868725ff05a97b014575	Linear type systems guarantee that no copies are made of certain program values. The EGO language is a foundational calculus which adds linearity to object oriented languages. EGO allows changes to be made to the interface of an object, such as the addition or removal of methods, as long as such an object is linear, ie, there exists only one reference to it. However, this linearity constraint is often unwieldy and hard to program with. We extend EGO with a linguistic primitive for temporarily relaxing the linearity guarantee.
5834868725ff05a97b014576	Software frameworks have changed significantly since they were described by researchers more than a decade ago. They have entered mainstream use in most domains of software development, and their structure and interaction mechanisms have evolved. This paper provides a revised definition of frameworks and surveys commonly used frameworks to extract two categorizations: a categorization of the different kinds of frameworks found in the wild and a summary of common interaction mechanisms employed by frameworks.
5834868725ff05a97b014590	A single web page in a complex web application has a huge number of possible runtime states. Functions, like JavaScript event handlers, that operate on such pages are extremely difficult to write correctly, because there are virtually no guaranteed constraints on the page. In this paper we propose DynXML, a new language for the web which safely and naturally mutates XML trees. Any dynamic web application written in DynXML is statically guaranteed to maintain the page in a subtype of a programmer-defined page type.
5834868725ff05a97b015993	This paper discusses an approach to incremental learning in natural language processing. The technique of projecting and integrating semantic constraints to learn word definitions is analyzed as implemented in the POLITICS system. Extensions and improvements of this technique are developed. The problem of generalizing existing word meanings and understanding metaphorical uses of words is addressed in terms of semantic constraint integration.
5834868725ff05a97b01543b	A simple backchannel and turn-taking system was added to a storytelling agent. This project improved upon a typical typed-input interface by incorporating ideas from discourse theory. It sought to create meaningful backchannel and turn-taking behavior while working within the problematical limitations of the usual computer interface consisting of a monitor and keyboard. The storytelling agent gained a responsive and engaging set of behavior, altering the paradigm and feel of a typing interface.
5834868625ff05a97b01173c	Distracted driving is a major problem that leads to unnecessary accidents and human casualties everywhere in the world. The ubiquity of mobile phones is one cause of distracted driving. In United States alone, operating mobile phones while driving has been cited as a factor in crashes that have led to 995 deaths and 24,000 injuries in 2009. To mitigate the problem of distracted driving caused by mobile phones, we propose using context-awareness to implement burden-shifting, time-shifting, and activity-based sharing.
5834868625ff05a97b011741	Using Wizard of Oz techniques, designers can efficiently test location-enhanced application prototypes during the early stages of design, without building a full-fledged application or deploying a sensing infrastructure. Location-enhanced applications adapt their behavior to or provide information about the location of people, places, and things. Such location-enhanced applications are the most widely adopted type of ubicomp application; analysts predict that their use will grow tremendously in the near future.
5834868725ff05a97b01468a	Programming languages often include specialized syntax for common datatypes (eg lists) and some also build in support for specific specialized datatypes (eg regular expressions), but user-defined types must use general-purpose syntax. Frustration with this causes developers to use strings, rather than structured data, with alarming frequency, leading to correctness, performance, security, and usability issues. Allowing library providers to modularly extend a language with new syntax could help address these issues.
5834868725ff05a97b0147ac	In this paper, we propose another yet generalization of Stirling numbers of the first kind for noninteger values of their arguments. We discuss the analytic representations of Stirling numbers through harmonic numbers, the generalized hypergeometric function and the logarithmic beta integral. We present then infinite series involving Stirling numbers and demonstrate how they are related to Euler sums. Finally, we derive the closed form for the multiple zeta function ζ (p, 1,…, 1) for Re (p)> 1.
5834868725ff05a97b0147a0	Tschirnhaus gave transformations for the elimination of some of the intermediate terms in a polynomial. His transformations were developed further by Bring and Jerrard, and here we describe all these transformations in modern notation. We also discuss their possible utility for polynomial solving, particularly with respect to the Mathematica poster on the solution of the quintic.
5834868625ff05a97b012d5b	Caedibacter caryophilus (Paramecium caudatum symbiont), Caedibacter macronucleorum (Paramecium duboscqui symbiont), Caedibacter paraconjugatus (Paramecium biaurelia symbiont), Caedibacter pseudomutans (Paramecium tetraurelia symbiont), Caedibacter taeniospiralis (Paramecium caudatum symbiont), and Caedibacter varicaedens (Paramecium biaurelia symbiont)(1). Of the Caedibacter species described to date, only the draft genome sequence of “Ca. Caedibacter acanthamoebae” has been determined (2).
5834868725ff05a97b013d49	Memory schedulers in multicore systems should carefully schedule memory requests from different threads to ensure high system performance and fair, fast progress of each thread. No existing memory scheduler provides both the highest system performance and highest fairness. Thread Cluster Memory scheduling is a new algorithm that achieves the best of both worlds by differentiating latency-sensitive threads from bandwidth-sensitive ones and employing different scheduling policies for each.
5834868725ff05a97b0145e6	Applicants to degree courses in Irish colleges and universities rank up to ten degree courses from a list of over ﬁve hundred. These data provide a wealth of information concerning applicant degree choices. A Dirichlet process mixture of generalized Mallows models are used to explore data from a cohort of applicants. We ﬁnd strong and diverse clusters, which in turn gains us important insights into the workings of the system. No previously tried models or analysis technique are able to model the data with comparable accuracy.
5834868725ff05a97b015cf5	We use computational modeling and formal analysis techniques to study temporal behavior of a discrete logical model of the naïve T cell differentiation. The model is analyzed formally and automatically by performing temporal logic queries via statistical model checking. The results obtained using model checking provide details about relative timing of events in the system, which would otherwise be very cumbersome and time consuming to obtain through simulations only.
5834868725ff05a97b0141ed	Increasing numbers of economic transactions are conducted through on-line auctions. Nevertheless, most current auction implementations fail to address important security concerns. In particular, most auction systems force buyers and sellers to trust the auctioneer; alternative secure systems are inflexible and have a high computational and/or communication overhead.
5834868725ff05a97b014219	An online handwritten text recognition system for Turkish has been developed using a tablet PC as an interface. In recent years, although there have been great developments in tablet PC technology, there are still no applications for recognition in the Turkish language. We have developed a prototype system using hidden Markov models which recognizes handwritten words from a small vocabulary list. This system has achieved a recognition rate of over 90%.
5834868625ff05a97b0124c7	Our working group began its task by agreeing on principles that have been well established by research and that can be used as a basis for further work to improve the learning of introductory algebra. Each principle is followed by one or two citations. In general, each citation refers to a number of studies, but there is not attempt at a full review of the literature.
5834868625ff05a97b0124cc	We propose self-regulated learning, particularly with the use of web-based resources, as a new domain for personal informatics. We consider development in intelligent computer-based student modeling that can provide sophisticated data for reflection and describe a preliminary system for collecting and visualizing data from web resources for this purpose.
5834868625ff05a97b0124cf	Many students have difficulty with inquiry and difficulty with interpreting data, in particular. Of interest here is confirmation bias, ie, when students won't discard a hypothesis based on disconfirming results, which is in direct contrast to when students make a discovery, having originally made a scientifically inaccurate hypothesis. The goal of the present study is to better understand these two data interpretation patterns and autoscore them. 145 eighth grade students engaged in inquiry with a state change microworld.
5834868625ff05a97b01199e	This technical report summarizes the demographics and Socially Observed Linked Opinion (SOLO) dataset, which came out of the Social Media ACTion study that took place at Carnegie Mellon during the summer of 2015. 124 individuals rated 4,320 social media posts and 1,680 news clips along the three dimensions used in Affect Control Theory. The report includes a description of the data, the training materials provided, and the consent form used for this study.
5834868725ff05a97b0151cd	In this talk we describe a class of models of social interaction called TAG models–trust, advice, and gossip. We expand this model by incorporating a computational model of emotion, called the ACT emotion engine derived from mathematical sociology and cognition.
5834868625ff05a97b012531	Bellcore has several active research programs relevant to human-computer interaction. This talk describes research conducted in the Cognitive Science and Interpersonal Communications Research Groups. We describe their research on information retrieval and on collaboration and pay particular attention to the styles of research employed in these groups and to the way in which behavioral investigations have guided technical invention.
5834868725ff05a97b0151d8	The Construct technical report describes the Construct model and lists the theories which it incorporates. Scientific literature that has used the model is listed as well as representative examples of real-world use within organizations. The report also defines the input and output variables and describes the various input and output files used with Construct. System requirements and performance characteristics are provided. Illustrative examples furnish a mini-tutorial on how to run virtual experiments with Construct.
5834868725ff05a97b013f33	In this paper, we present a unified framework for reduced space modeling and rendering of dynamic and non-homogenous participating media, like snow, smoke, dust and fog. The key idea is to represent the 3D spatial variation of the density, velocity and intensity fields of the media using the same analytic basis. In many situations, natural effects such as mist, outdoor smoke and dust are smooth (low frequency) phenomena, and can be compactly represented by a small number of coefficients of a Legendre polynomial basis.
5834868725ff05a97b01496a	Human routines are blueprints of behavior, which allow people to accomplish purposeful repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their day to how they drive through an intersection. People express their routines through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines.
5834868725ff05a97b013f41	Given a single outdoor image, we present a method for estimating the likely illumination conditions of the scene. In particular, we compute the probability distribution over the sun position and visibility. The method relies on a combination of weak cues that can be extracted from different portions of the image: the sky, the vertical surfaces, the ground, and the convex objects in the image. While no single cue can reliably estimate illumination by itself, each one can reinforce the others to yield a more robust estimate.
5834868625ff05a97b012f53	This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the motion of a 3D articulated tree from 2D point correspondences subject to some temporal prior. Hitherto, smooth motion has been encouraged using a trajectory basis, yielding a hard combinatorial problem with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames. Branch and bound strategies have previously attempted to curb this complexity whilst maintaining global optimality. However, they provide no guarantee of being more efficient than exhaustive search.
5834868725ff05a97b013f72	When users handle large amounts of data, errors are hard to notice. Outlier finding is a new way to reduce errors by directing the user's attention to inconsistent data which may indicate errors. We have implemented an outlier finder for text, which can detect both unusual matches and unusual mismatches to a text pattern. When integrated into the user interface of a PBD text editor and tested in a user study, outlier finding substantially reduced errors.
5834868725ff05a97b01499d	We describe and analyze a PAC-asymptotic model for active learning. We show that in many cases where it has traditionally been believed that active learning does not help, active learning does help asymptotically. This view contrasts sharply with the traditional 1/ǫ lower bounds for active learning classes such as non-homogeneous linear separators under the uniform distribution or unions of k intervals under an arbitrary distribution, both of which are learnable at an exponential rate in our model.
5834868625ff05a97b012f94	Pain is typically assessed by patient self-report. Self-reported pain, however, is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances (ie, young children and the severely ill) not even possible. To circumvent these problems behavioral scientists have identified reliable and valid facial indicators of pain. Hitherto, these methods have required manual measurement by highly skilled human observers. In this paper we explore an approach for automatically recognizing acute pain without the need for human observers.
5834868725ff05a97b013d76	Proteomics is the comprehensive study of all aspects of protein behavior. The subfield of location proteomics is concerned with the systematic analysis of the subcellular location of proteins. In order to perform high-resolution, high-throughput analysis of all protein location patterns, automation is needed both for acquisition and analysis. Automated methods for analyzing subcellular location patterns in fluorescence microscope images have been developed and shown to work well for static 2D and 3D images of single cells.
5834868625ff05a97b0134cb	A single student step in an intelligent tutor may involve multiple subskills. Conventional approaches either sidestep this problem, model the step as using only its least known subskill, or treat the subskills as necessary and probabilistically independent. In contrast, we use logistic regression in a Dynamic Bayes Net (LR-DBN) to trace the multiple subskills. We compare these three types of models on a published data set from a cognitive tutor. LR-DBN fits the data significantly better, with only half as many prediction errors on unseen data.
5834868725ff05a97b015a28	Formal verification is becoming a useful means of validating designs. We have developed a methodology for formally verifying dataintensive circuits (eg, processors) with sophisticated timing (eg, pipelining) against high-level declarative specifications. Previously, formally verifying a microprocessor required the use of an automatic theorem prover, but our technique requires little more than a symbolic simulator. We have formally verified a pre-existing 16-bit CISC microprocessor circuit extracted from the fabricated layout.
5834868725ff05a97b015626	The act of sharing stories, which often characterizes the interactions between grandparents and grandchildren, exerts a profound influence on both the child listener and the grandparent teller. Unfortunately, opportunities for such sharing are rare for the many extended families who are geographically separated, and the stories go untold. Simple methods such as tape recorders or memory books can be difficult to work with, as they do not provide the powerful feedback that an active and interested listener can give.
5834868725ff05a97b0149dd	We present a framework for margin based active learning of linear separators. We instantiate it for a few important cases, some of which have been previously considered in the literature. We analyze the effectiveness of our framework both in the realizable case and in a specific noisy setting related to the Tsybakov small noise condition.
5834868625ff05a97b012fac	Event Mention detection is the first step in textual event understanding. Proper evaluation is important for modern natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present our evaluation algorithm and results during the Event Mention Evaluation pilot study. We analyze the problems of evaluating multiple event mention attributes and discontinuous event mention spans. In addition, we identify a few limitations in the evaluation algorithm used for the pilot task and propose some potential improvements.
5834868625ff05a97b012fad	Event coreference is an important task for full text analysis. However, previous work uses a variety of approaches, sources and evaluation, making the literature confusing and the results incommensurate. We provide a description of the differences to facilitate future research. Second, we present a supervised method for event coreference resolution that uses a rich feature set and propagates information alternatively between events and their arguments, adapting appropriately for each type of argument.
5834868625ff05a97b012fb7	The I/O: Paper Prototyping for the Future studio will be a hands-on experience that combines art, design, and technology. Participants will learn through a series of escalating exercises how to introduce interactivity via computational crafting techniques to paper in order to heighten the paper prototyping experience.
5834868725ff05a97b01401a	Main memory is a major shared resource among cores in a multicore system. If the interference between different applications' memory requests is not controlled effectively, system performance can degrade significantly. Previous work aimed to mitigate the problem of interference between applications by changing the scheduling policy in the memory controller, ie, by prioritizing memory requests from applications in a way that benefits system performance.
5834868725ff05a97b01405d	Because of the complexity of biological systems, cutting-edge machine-learning methods will be critical for future drug development. In particular, machine-vision methods to extract detailed information from imaging assays and active-learning methods to guide experimentation will be required to overcome the dimensionality problem in drug development.
5834868725ff05a97b0140b6	In this video, we present approaches for learning throwing and catching skills. We first show how a hitting skill (ie, table tennis) can be learned using a combination of imitation and reinforcement learning. This hitting skill is subsequently generalized to a catching skill. Secondly, we show how a robot can adapt a throwing skill to new targets. Finally, we demonstrate that a BioRob and a Barrett WAM can play catch together using the previously acquired skills.
5834868725ff05a97b01414e	We now discuss how accumulated platform information (Section 2) can benefit a local user. Unfortunately, these measurements cannot be used to directly provide information to local software; ie, it does not make sense for higher-privileged software to use these measurements to convey information to less-privileged software, since the less-privileged software must already trust the higher-privileged software.
5834868725ff05a97b01414f	Trust in any system needs a foundation or a root of trust. Here, we discuss the roots of trust that have been proposed or deployed. Typically, the root of trust is based on the secrecy of a private key that is embedded in hardware; the corresponding public key is certified by the hardware's manufacturer. As we discuss, some systems further rely on a piece of code that must execute in the early boot process for their root of trust. We also discuss schemes where the root of trust is established by the properties of the physical hardware itself.
5834868725ff05a97b014665	Ownership domain annotations specify in code architectural intent related to object encapsulation and communication. These annotations also enable the static extraction of a sound hierarchical representation of the runtime object graph. The tool support consists of one Eclipse plugin to typecheck the annotations inserted as Java 1.5 annotations, and another to extract a representation of the runtime object graph abstracted by ownership hierarchy and by types.
5834868725ff05a97b014682	The subject-observer design pattern is a very common idiom in object-oriented systems; for example, it is an essential part of the model-view-controller pattern for programming graphical user interfaces. We give a modular proof technique using separation logic to verify this pattern. This proof method is modular in the sense that subjects and observers can be verified independently, and both can be verified independently of client code that calls both.
5834868725ff05a97b014685	Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic which permits reasoning about low-level imperative programs that use shared mutable heap structure. In this work, we present a version of separation logic that permits effective, modular reasoning about typed, higherorder functional programs that use aliased mutable heap data, including pointers to code. Furthermore, we show how to use predicates in higher-order separation logic to modularly and abstractly specify the sharing behavior of programs.
5834868725ff05a97b014687	Language (ADL) with an implementation in ArchJava, an extension of the Java programming language that includes explicit architectural modeling constructs.
5834868725ff05a97b014694	Interactive programs, such as GUIs or spreadsheets, often maintain dependency information over dynamically-created networks of objects. That is, each imperative object tracks not only the objects its own invariant depends on, but also all of the objects which depend upon it, in order to notify them when it changes.
5834868725ff05a97b015cad	In this paper, we propose a single low-dimensional representation for entities found in different datasets on the web. Our proposed PIC-D embeddings can represent large D-partite graphs using small number of dimensions enabling fast similarity queries. Our experiments show that this representation can be constructed in small amount of time (linear in number of dimensions). We demonstrate how it can be used for variety of similarity queries like set expansion, automatic set instance acquisition, and column classification.
5834868725ff05a97b01440c	In this work, we present a prototype system for translation of Turkmen texts into Turkish. Although machine translation (MT) is a very hard task, it is easier to implement a MT system between very close language pairs which have similar syntactic structure and word order. We implement a direct translation system between Turkmen and Turkish which performs a word-to-word transfer. We also use a Turkish Language Model to find the most probable Turkish sentence among all possible candidate translations generated by our system.
5834868725ff05a97b014432	This paper describes the implementation of a two-level morphological analyzer for the Turkmen Language. Like all Turkic languages, the Turkmen Language is an agglutinative language that has productive inflectional and derivational suffixes. In this work, we implemented a finite-state two-level morphological analyzer for Turkmen Language by using Xerox Finite State Tools.

5834868725ff05a97b014449	This paper describes a hybrid pattern classification system based on a pattern preprocessor and an artificial neural network classifier that can recognize patterns even when they are deformed by transformation of rotation, scaling, and translation or a combination of these. After a description of the system architecture we provide experimental results from three different classification domains: classification of letters in the English alphabet, classification of the letters in the Japanese Katakana alphabet, and classification of geometric figures.
5834868725ff05a97b014450	The design and implementation of a VLSI chip for the one-dimensional median filtering operation is presented. The device is designed to operate on 8-bit sample sequences with a window size of five samples. Extensive pipelining and employment of systolic data-flow concepts at the bit level enable the chip to filter at rates up to ten megasamples per second. A configuration for using the chip for approximate two-dimensional median filtering operation is also presented.
5834868725ff05a97b0151de	ORA is a network analysis tool that detects risks or vulnerabilities of an organization's design structure. The design structure of an organization is the relationship among its personnel, knowledge, resources, and tasks entities. These entities and relationships are represented by the Meta-Matrix. Measures that take as input a Meta-Matrix are used to analyze the structural properties of an organization for potential risk. ORA contains over 50 measures which are categorized by which type of risk they detect.
5834868625ff05a97b0119f3	We present a program transformation framework based on symbolic execution and deduction. Its virtues are:(i) behavior preservation of the transformed program is guaranteed by a sound program logic, and (ii) automated first-order solvers are used for simplification and optimization. Transformation consists of two phases: first the source program is symbolically executed by sequent calculus rules in a program logic. This involves a precise analysis of variable dependencies, aliasing, and elimination of infeasible execution paths.
5834868725ff05a97b013ce7	Gestures are a powerful way to specify both objects and operations with a single mark of a stylus or mouse. We have extended an existing user interface toolkit to support gestures asa standard type of interaction so that researchers can easily explore this technology..
5834868625ff05a97b011a2c	The gaming and linguistic data generating technique described herein provides an online multiplayer game that can generate linguistic data, such as, for example, monolingual paraphrase data or multilingual parallel data, as a by-product of the game. The game is designed along the lines of sketch-and-convey paradigm. The game can be played as follows. A phrase is chosen from a phrase corpus and is given to one player (the “Drawer”) who then conveys it to the other player (the “Guesser”) by drawing a picture of the phrase.
5834868625ff05a97b011a4e	We analyze the possibility of parallelizing the Traveling Salesman Problem over the MapReduce architecture. We present the serial and parallel versions of two algorithms-Tabu Search and Large Neighborhood Search. We compare the best tour length achieved by the Serial version versus the best achieved by the MapReduce version. We show that Tabu Search and Large Neighborhood Search are not well suited for parallelization over MapReduce.
5834868725ff05a97b01522e	This report describes a study of human and organizational risk within NASA's Team X, a conceptual mission design team. A grounded theory approach was used to develop computational models for risk analysis. Among the major findings in the analysis were identification of critical personnel, risk of turnover and performance tradeoff of differing leadership styles.
5834868625ff05a97b011ef5	Research on robotic helpers emphasizes their potential to improve human performance, but little attention has been given to the effects of robotic helpers on the social and psychological well-being of help recipients. Interactions with human helpers are not always positive and can threaten help recipients' confidence, independence, sense of identity, and task enjoyment. In a similar way, recipients of robotic assistance may find that the benefits of receiving help are paired with negative social and psychological outcomes.

5834868625ff05a97b01304c	What trajectory will a billiard ball follow on a pool table? Suppose it has initial velocity v0 and angular velocity ω0. Assume no bouncing of the ball. It will first slide from its initial location x0 until the contact velocity reduces to zero at some location x1. Then it will roll without slip to a stop at another location x2. In this appendix, we will show that the billiard trajectory consists of a parabolic segment from sliding and a line segment from rolling without slip. The trajectory is illustrated in Figure 1.
5834868725ff05a97b01426e	Ad hoc networks use mobile nodes to enable communication outside wireless transmission range. Attacks on ad hoc network routing protocols disrupt network performance and reliability. The article reviews attacks on ad hoc networks and discusses current approaches for establishing cryptographic keys in ad hoc networks. We describe the state of research in secure ad hoc routing protocols and its research challenges.
5834868625ff05a97b0131fa	A programmable parts feeder, a mechanism that can be reprogrammed to handle differently shaped parts, is discussed. The authors present a planning algorithm that accepts an n-sided polygonal part as input and, in time O (n/sup 2/), generates a program (plan) for the feeder that maximizes expected feedrate. They have implemented the planner and verified some of the resulting plans in the laboratory. This work illustrates a stochastic framework for manipulation planning.
5834868625ff05a97b011f28	1. Hypothesized that, if norms function to insure predictable interaction, people who violate norms may be disliked because they appear to be unpredictable. Norm violators would lose esteem to the extent that persons interacting with them prefer predictability in the situation. However, if situational demands induce participants to prefer unpredictability, norm violators should be liked more than those who act appropriately. 2 experiments were conducted with 229 high school students and 126 female undergraduates, respectively.
5834868725ff05a97b014878	Cuckoo Cycle is a recently proposed “memory-hard” computational Proof-of-Work (PoW) function designed to require a minimum amount of memory to compute efficiently. This paper describes two algorithms that use the sparsity of the Cuckoo Cycle graph to use less memory than both the initially hypothesized and updated proposed bounds for this proof-of-work function. The second algorithm presents a near-linear time/memory tradeoff for the most computationally intensive part of solving the Cuckoo Cycle proofof-work function.
5834868625ff05a97b013204	Graphical methods are often applied to planar mechanics problems, especially in the context of robotic manipulation, but there are limitations. In particular, the friction cone is an elegant representation of the set of forces generated by a single frictional contact, but there was previously no simple extension to problems of multiple frictional contacts. The paper shows a simple generalization of the friction cone to include multiple contacts. It demonstrates applications to dynamics problems and manipulation planning problems.

5834868725ff05a97b01545b	We present Radar-Soar, a model of a cognitive agent learning to classify aircraft as friendly, neutral, or hostile based on a discrete set of characteristics. This agent is built using the Soar cognitive architecture which has as one of its main features a powerful form of explanation-based learning called chunking. We show that the performance this agent exhibits is extremely high and surpasses that of a comparable agent that has previously been built.
5834868725ff05a97b01545d	2 LAVVLER abstract from that process objectives, methods, and values that will help us as students of mind to identify and solve our own problems and judge the value of those solutions. This is not an attempt to develop a single, universal method. It is an analysis of how we can proceed to conclusions of interest that we can have confidence in. One hopes that in physics there are other analyses and explanations that can, in turn, further illuminate research in psychology.
5834868725ff05a97b015475	ORA is the organizational risk analyzer. Its purpose is to assess the level of possible organizational risk and the factors that contribute to this risk. All measures are based on the meta-matrix and take in to account the relations among personnel, knowledge, resources and tasks. These measures are based on work in social networks, operations research, organization theory, knowledge management, and task management. As ORA is a product in development, additional measures will be added.

5834868725ff05a97b013dec	We list a collection of open problems in real analysis in computer science, which complements, updates and extends a previous list curated by Ryan O'Donnell (2012). The object of study in these problems are boolean functions f:{0, 1} n→{0, 1}, and their analytic and combinatorial properties. Many of the questions originate from in theoretical computer science or the theory of voting. The formulation of many of the questions has a strong combinatorial and analytical flavor including the use of the discrete Fourier expansion.
5834868725ff05a97b014704	Political inclinations of individuals (liberal vs. conservative) largely shape their opinions on several issues such as abortion, gun control, nuclear power, etc. These opinions are openly exerted in online forums, news sites, the parliament, and so on. In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying political polarity of individuals and of political issues for classification and ranking. We use signed bipartite networks to represent the opinions of individuals on issues, and formulate the problem as a node classification task.
5834868725ff05a97b013de9	Consider systems of two-variable linear equations of the form xi− xj= cij, where the cij's are integer constants. We show that even if there is an integer solution satisfying at least a (1− ϵ)-fraction of the equations, it is Unique-Games-hard to find an integer (or even real) solution satisfying at least an ϵ-fraction of the equations. Indeed, we show it is Unique-Games-hard even to find an ϵ-good solution modulo any integer m≥ m0 (ϵ) of the algorithm's choosing.

We give a polynomial time algorithm for learning decision trees and DNF formulas in this model. This is the first efficient algorithm for learning these classes in a natural passive learning model where the learner has no influence over the choice of examples used for learning.
5834868725ff05a97b013e65	Question-answering systems are expanding beyond information retrieval and information extraction, to become fullfledged, complex NLP applications. In this paper we discuss the evaluation of question-answering systems as complex NLP systems, and suggest three different dimensions for evaluation: objective or information-based evaluation; subjective evaluation; and architectural evaluation. We also discuss the role of ambiguity resolution in QA systems, and how ambiguity resolution might be evaluated.

The methods include identifying a plurality of users of the social network who perform a plurality of tasks within the social network in a lockstep manner. In the method, the plurality of users are determined to be performing a given task in the lockstep manner when the plurality of users each perform the given task within a predefined duration of time, where the predefined duration of time is associated with the given task.
5834868725ff05a97b014e0f	This paper describes the two Story Link Detection systems Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed, and examines why their performance on the evaluation data was considerably worse than expected while performance on an alternate evaluation set matched the performance on the training data.
5834868725ff05a97b014d48	Computer security games, especially capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, are growing in popularity. A typical CTF contest presents users with a set of hacking challenges, where correct solutions reveal a text “flag” that can be submitted to a scoring server. In traditional CTF architectures, the problem and the flag are the same across the competition. In this paper we discuss automatic problem generation (APG), where a given challenge is not fixed, but rather can have many different automatically generated problem instances.

Relations to the Barnes G-function and generalized Glaisher's constants are also discussed.
5834868725ff05a97b0147da	We present early results on a dynamic mesh refinement algorithm. Using a variant of the Sparse Voronoi Refinement algorithm and applying the technique of Self-Adjusting Computation, we find that we expect to run in O (polylog n) time per update on points sets in arbitrary dimension. This is based on some theoretical results, along with experimental results from an implementation.
5834868725ff05a97b01553d	Universities have had a major impact on the EDA industry. University research projects have formed the basis for many important advances in CAD, and university graduates have provided the intellectual talent that has generated further ideas and turned ideas into commercial products. Research funding has been critical to universities both to enable the research to take place, and to support graduate students. Historically, much of this funding has come from the US government, particularly the Department of Defense.

5834868725ff05a97b0149b6	We consider computational aspects of alternating move games, repeated games in which players take actions at alternating time steps rather than playing simultaneously. We show that alternating move games are more tractable than simultaneous move games: we give an FPTAS for computing an ε-approximate equilibrium of an alternating move game with any number of players. In contrast, it is known that for k≥ 3 players, there is no FPTAS for computing Nash equilibria of simultaneous move repeated games unless P= PPAD.
5834868725ff05a97b014e8a	Website privacy policies often contain ambiguous language that undermines the purpose and value of privacy notices for site users. This paper compares the impact of different regulatory models on the ambiguity of privacy policies in multiple online sectors. First, the paper develops a theory of vague and ambiguous terms. Next, the paper develops a scoring method to compare the relative vagueness of different privacy policies. Then the theory and scoring are applied using natural language processing to rate a set of policies.

The Typology has been augmented with surface-level patterns associated with answer types, allowing systems to locate answers of the desired type in text by simple string matching. These patterns are extracted from the web automatically. We describe the process of their extraction, compression, and accuracy determination.

In this paper, we study the challenges of working at the terascale. We present an algorithm, designed for the teraxale, for mining is-a relations that achieves similar performance to a state-of-the-art linguistically-rich method. We focus on the accuracy of these two systems as a function of processing time and corpus size.

5834868625ff05a97b011713	Identifying sentiments (the affective parts of opinions) is a challenging problem. We present a system that, given a topic, automatically finds the people who hold opinions about that topic and the sentiment of each opinion. The system contains a module for determining word sentiment and another for combining sentiments within a sentence. We experiment with various models of classifying and combining sentiment at word and sentence levels, with promising results.

5834868725ff05a97b013a89	It is well-known that conventional programming languages are difficult to learn and use, s requiring skills that many people do not have [1]. However, there are significant advantages to upplying programming capabilities in the user interfaces of a wide variety of programs. For p example, the success of spreadsheets can be partially attributed to the ability of users to write rograms (as collections of ''formulas'').
5834868625ff05a97b012ecd	We introduce a data structure, analysis and visualization scheme called a cactus graph for comparing sets of related genomes. Cactus graphs capture some of the advantages of de Bruijn and breakpoint graphs in one unified framework. They naturally decompose the common substructures in a set of related genomes into a hierarchy of chains that can be visualized as multiple alignments and nets that can be visualized in circular genome plots.
5834868725ff05a97b014751	HVAC systems constitute∼ 40% of energy in commercial buildings, and faults in HVAC account for 5% to 20% of its energy consumption. Typically, HVAC in modern buildings are managed using Building Managing Systems (BMS), and fault detection is one of the essential services provided by BMS to keep HVAC operational. We study the fault management practices followed in real commercial buildings, and find that current techniques used for fault detection fail to detect large number of efficiency related faults.
5834868725ff05a97b013ebb	Visual localization systems that are practical for autonomous vehicles in outdoor industrial applications must perform reliably in a wide range of conditions. Changing outdoor conditions cause difficulty by drastically altering the information available in the camera images. To confront the problem, we have developed a visual localization system that uses a surveyed three-dimensional (3D)-edge map of permanent structures in the environment. The map has the invariant properties necessary to achieve long-term robust operation.
5834868725ff05a97b014762	A holistic approach to reducing the energy footprint of large commercial buildings is proposed. A detailed energy use breakdown within a modern building is presented, leading to the key insight that, in addition to the HVAC system, the energy used by miscellaneous plug loads which include IT equipment must also be addressed. An actuation framework is proposed to control plug-loads and the HVAC system for energy savings.
5834868725ff05a97b01524c	Competitive adaptation refers to how adversaries such as terrorist groups and government counterterrorism agencies learn and adapt behavior based on behavior of the other. Using significant events as guides, studying the adaptation will identify and characterize how groups will evolve.
5834868725ff05a97b015c46	Creating facial animations that convey an animator's intent is a difficult task because animation techniques are necessarily an approximation of the subtle motion of the face. Some animation techniques may result in linearization of the motion of vertices in space (blendshapes, for example), and other, simpler techniques may result in linearization of the motion in time. In this article, we consider the problem of animating smiles and explore how these simplifications in space and time affect the perceived genuineness of smiles.

5834868725ff05a97b013af1	BACKGROUND Leveraging technology to develop novel advance care planning tools is an important step to ensure patients' wishes are met and to ease the burden on surrogate decision makers. There are few examples of how to rigorously test and improve new health technologies to increase satisfaction and decrease training and support needs.
5834868725ff05a97b014343	How can we spot anomalies in large, time-evolving graphs? When we have multi-aspect data, eg who published which paper on which conference and on what year, how can we combine this information, in order to obtain good summaries thereof and unravel hidden anomalies and patterns? Such multi-aspect data, including time-evolving graphs, can be successfully modelled using Tensors. In this paper, we show that when we have multiple dimensions in the dataset, then tensor analysis is a powerful and promising tool.
5834868725ff05a97b013af3	Our research is highlighting some potential directions for the future of user interface design tools. One approach is to make the tools and their SDKs more usable, effective and understandable by making them more natural. Another is to take advantage of an “open data model” to more easily integrate new components. In addition, programming-bydemonstration techniques and model-based automatic generation still hold much promise.
5834868725ff05a97b013e7c	In this paper we describe the KANTOO machine translation environment, a set of software services and tools for multilingual document production. KANTOO includes modules for source language analysis, target language generation, source terminology management, target terminology management, and knowledge source development. The KANTOOsystem represents a complete re-design and re-implementation of the KANT machine translation system.
5834868725ff05a97b014f1e	This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm to color any 3-colorable n-node graph with O (n 2/5 log 8/5 n) colors, improving the best previously known bound of O (√ n/√ log n) colors. By reducing the number of colors needed to color a 3-colorable graph, the algorithm also improves the bound for k-coloring for fixed k≥ 3 from the previous O ((n/log n) 1-1/(k-1)) colors to O (n 1-1/(k-4/3) log 8/5 n) colors. An extension of the algorithm further improves the bounds. Precise values appear in a table at the end of this paper.
5834868725ff05a97b014dbf	Complete physically embodied agents present a powerful medium for the investigation of cognitive models for spatial navigation. This article presents a maze-solving robot, called a micromouse, that parallels many of the behaviors found in its biological counterpart, the rat. A cognitive model of the robot is presented, and its limits are investigated. Limits are found to exist with respect to biological plausibility and robot applicability. It is proposed that the fundamental representations used to store and process information are the limiting factor.
5834868725ff05a97b01399c	In this paper we consider the problem of controlling multiple robots manipulating and transporting a payload in three dimensions via cables. We develop robot configurations that ensure static equilibrium of the payload at a desired pose while respecting constraints on the tension and provide analysis of payload stability for these configurations. We demonstrate our methods on a team of aerial robots via simulation and experimentation.
5834868625ff05a97b012010	Information theory provides an attractive framework for attacking the neural coding problem. This entails estimating information theoretic quantities from neural spike train data. This paper highlights two issues that may arise: non-parametric entropy estimation and non-stationarity. It gives an overview of these issues and some of the progress that has been made.
5834868725ff05a97b01399d	We study the problem of designing dynamically feasible trajectories and controllers that drive a quadrotor to a desired state in state space. We focus on the development of a family of trajectories defined as a sequence of segments, each with a controller parameterized by a goal state or region in state space. Each controller is developed from the dynamic model of the robot and then iteratively refined through successive experimental trials in an automated fashion to account for errors in the dynamic model and noise in the actuators and sensors.
5834868725ff05a97b014f3d	The smoothed complexity [1] of an algorithm is the expected running time of the algorithm on an arbitrary instance under a random perturbation. It was shown recently that the simplex algorithm has polynomial smoothed complexity. We show that a simple greedy algorithm for linear programming, the perceptron algorithm, also has polynomial smoothed complexity, in a high probability sense; that is, the running time is polynomial with high probability over the random perturbation.
5834868625ff05a97b01151d	We believe that in the future, the most common form of recommender systems will be present in a personal assistant. We claim that such an intelligent agent must be personal, ie, know its user's preferences and recommend relevant content, a dynamic learner, instructable, supportive and affable. We describe the current state of the art and the challenges which should be addressed in each of these agent properties and provide examples of how we expect future personal agents to convey these properties.
5834868725ff05a97b013f62	Current vision systems are designed to perform in clear weather. Needless to say, in any outdoor application, there is no escape from “bad” weather. Ultimately, computer vision systems must include mechanisms that enable them to function (even if somewhat less reliably) in the presence of haze, fog, rain, hail and snow.
5834868625ff05a97b01202f	1610 W. Wang et al. and apply these models to spike trains from olfactory bulb mitral cells recorded in vitro. We find that spike generation in these neurons is better modeled when reliable and unreliable spikes are considered separately and that this effect is most pronounced for neurons with a large number of both reliable and unreliable spikes.
5834868725ff05a97b013fab	A taxonomy for the user-visible parts of window managers is presented. It is noted that there are actually very few significant differences, and the differences can be classified in a taxonomy with fairly limited branching. This taxonomy should be useful in evaluating various window managers, and it will also serve as a guide for the issues that need to be addressed by designers if future window-manager user interfaces. The advantages and disadvantages of the various options are presented.
5834868725ff05a97b013af5	Our research focuses on developing interactive technologies for a broad range of end-user programming activities, including code construction, verification, debugging, and understanding. A common goal among all of these technologies is to identify core ideas that can be used across a variety of domains and programmer populations.

5834868725ff05a97b015759	In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for multiple device interaction includes detecting an orientation of a first device relative to a second device. The method also includes detecting a first gesture performed with either the first device or the second device, wherein the first gesture causes a first action that is based at least in part on the orientation of the first device relative to the second device.
5834868725ff05a97b013b29	Observations of developers indicate that developers try to answer a variety of questions by searching across control flow paths through a program for statements matching search criteria. We believe that tools that better support this activity can help developers answer these questions more easily, quickly, and accurately.
5834868725ff05a97b014baa	We present CAMEO, the Camera Assisted Meeting Event Observer, which is a physical awareness system designed for use by an agent-based electronic assistant. CAMEO is used to observe formal meeting environments and infer the activities of people attending them.
5834868725ff05a97b015781	This poster will present a computer graphics application for improving snooker skills training. We developed an automated modelling and rendering pipeline that converts video input data to a time-varying 3D graphical model that can be animated from arbitrary viewing positions. In addition, we introduced illustrative rendering capability that provides coaches and players with various annotated graphics as training aids. The reconstruction of 3D models relies only on a single camera view.
5834868725ff05a97b013b05	A patient with nephritic factor in the serum following an attack of disseminated herpes is described. In the majority of cases, the factor is associated with mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis, with or without partial lipodystrophy. It has, however, been described in cases of partial lipodystrophy alone, in one patient with recurrent pyogenic infections, and in one healthy individual. It has not previously been described in an individual with disseminated viral infection.
5834868725ff05a97b013827	Measurement-Based Estimators are able to characterise data flows, enabling improvements to existing management techniques and access to previously impossible management techniques. It is the thesis of this dissertation that in addition to making practical adaptive management schemes, measurement-based estimators can be practical within current limitations of resource.
5834868625ff05a97b01174b	DENIM is a system that helps web site designers in the early stages of design. DENIM supports sketching input; allows design at different refinement levels--site map, storyboard, and individual page; and unifies the levels through zooming. The design of DENIM was informed by a study of web site design practice, in which we observed that web site designers design sites at the levels of refinement mentioned above and that designers sketch at all levels during the early stages of design.
5834868625ff05a97b012204	Software product line engineering provides efficient means to develop variable software. To support program comprehension of software product lines (SPLs), we developed View Infinity, a tool that provides seamless and semantic zooming of different abstraction layers of an SPL. First results of a qualitative study with experienced SPL developers are promising and indicate that View Infinity is useful and intuitive to use.
5834868725ff05a97b014fda	Parallel processing is performed by determining sequential ordering of tasks for processing, assigning priorities to the tasks available on the basis of the sequential ordering, selecting a number of tasks greater than a total number of available parallel processing elements from all available tasks having the highest priorities, partitioning the selected tasks into a number of groups equal to the available number of parallel processing elements, and executing the tasks in the parallel processing elements.
5834868625ff05a97b012209	Creating a software product line from a legacy application is a difficult task. We propose a tool that helps automating tedious tasks of refactoring legacy applications into features and frees the developer from the burden of performing laborious routine implementations.
5834868625ff05a97b011781	There is a tremendous amount of web content available today, but it is not always in a form that supports end-users' needs. In many cases, all of the data and services needed to accomplish a goal already exist, but are not in a form amenable to an end-user. To address this problem, we have developed an end-user programming tool called Marmite, which lets end-users create so-called mashups that re-purpose and combine existing web content and services. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Marmite.
5834868625ff05a97b012270	After the observations were observed, the posterior distribution under mild conditions becomes more concentrated in the neighbourhood of the mode of the posterior distribution as sample size n increase. In this paper, the exponential rate of convergence of posterior distribution around the mode is established by using the generalized Laplace method. An example is also given.
5834868725ff05a97b01501d	This paper describes a working two-way speech-to-speech translation system that runs in near real-time on a consumer handheld computer. It can translate from English to Arabic and Arabic to English in the domain of medical interviews. We describe the general architecture and frameworks within which we developed each of the components: HMM-based recognition, interlingua translation (both rule and statistically based), and unit selection synthesis.
5834868725ff05a97b015028	As it is impossible to have a lexicon with complete coverage, and a high proportion of unknown words are proper names, this paper addresses the issue of automatically finding pronunciations of unseen proper names in US English. Proper names, especially in the US, may come from a large range of ethnic backgrounds. We present a model and results showing that including ethnic origin of words in a statistical model can improve pronunciation results.
5834868725ff05a97b01502d	With the recent improvements in speech technology, it is now possible to build spoken dialog systems that basically work. However, such systems are designed and tailored for the general population. When users come from less general sections of the population, such as the elderly and non-native speakers of English, the accuracy of dialog systems degrades.
5834868625ff05a97b0117ea	Steps toward the realization of a tele-nanorobotic manipulation system using a magnetically levitated hand controller coupled with a scanning tunneling microscope are discussed. With this system, it is possible to'manually'probe surfaces at atomic scale, while'feeling'the atomic-scale topography back in the operator's hand. Results for sputtered gold and graphite are presented.
5834868725ff05a97b015075	Because of polysemy, distant labeling for information extraction leads to noisy training data. We describe a procedure for reducing this noise by using label propagation on a graph in which the nodes are entity mentions, and mentions are coupled when they occur in coordinate list structures. We show that this labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers are used on the distantly-labeled data.
5834868725ff05a97b014c5c	We consider the problem of highly space-efficient representation of separable graphs while supporting queries in constant time in the RAM with logarithmic word size. In particular, we show constanttime support for adjacency, degree and neighborhood queries. For any monotone class of separable graphs, the storage requirement of the representation is optimal to within lower order terms. Separable graphs are those that admit a O (nc)-separator theorem where c< 1. Many graphs that arise in practice are indeed separable.
5834868725ff05a97b014c63	This manual is a supplement to the language definition of NEsL version 3.1. It describes how to use the NEsL system interactively and covers features for accessing on-line help, debugging, profiling, executing programs on remote machines, using NEsL with GNU Emacs, and installing and customizing the NEsL system.
5834868625ff05a97b01230f	A two-way deterministic finite automaton with r (n) reversals performs≤ r (n) input head reversals on every n-long input. Let 2D [r (n)] be all families of problems solvable by such automata of size polynomial in the index of the family. Then the reversal hierarchy 2D [0]⊆ 2D [1]⊆ 2D [2]⊆··· is strict, but 2D [O (1)]= 2D [o (n)]. Moreover, the innerreversal hierarchy 2D (0)⊆ 2D (1)⊆ 2D (2)⊆···, where now the bound is only for reversals strictly between the input end-markers, is also strict.
5834868725ff05a97b013b7e	Millions of people program to support their work but don't call themselves programmers. The field of end-user software engineering is concerned with helping these people create reliable, dependable, and reusable programs, without distracting them from their primary tasks. This special issue of IEEE Software presents a selection of research from this field, providing a glimpse of some of the exciting advances made in past 10 years of research and development.
5834868725ff05a97b014bbc	Balancing the multiple uses of ICD-9-CM with its central purpose as a statistical classification system is the function of the Coordination and Maintenance Committee. This article describes the process to modify diagnosis and procedure codes and how AHIMA members can contribute to improving ICD-9-CM.
5834868725ff05a97b014bbe	We consider the problem of scheduling a conference to achieve the benefits in time-compression of parallel sessions, but without the associated high degree of conflict between talks. We describe a randomized construction meeting these goals that we analyze based on an expansion property of an associated graph. We also give algorithms for attendees scheduling their time within such a conference, and algorithms for verifying a proposed conference schedule. Finally, we present simulation results for typical conference sizes.
5834868725ff05a97b013b9b	Human factors affecting the dependability of end user's programs are discussed in the context of controlled and observational studies of both professional and end-user programmers. These factors include the influence of the types of behaviors that end users wish to implement, end user's fundamental cognitive biases, barriers in the languages, environments, libraries, and other tools used by end users, and end users' difficulties with understanding their code's meaning and execution.
5834868625ff05a97b012ee8	Accurately reconstructing the large-scale gene order in an ancestral genome is a critical step to better understand genome evolution. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm, called DUPCAR, for reconstructing ancestral genomic orders with duplications. The method starts from the order of genes in modern genomes and predicts predecessor and successor relationships in the ancestor. Then a greedy algorithm is used to reconstruct the ancestral orders by connecting genes into contiguous regions based on predicted adjacencies.
5834868625ff05a97b012efb	NAND flash memory is a widely used storage medium that can be treated as a noisy channel. Each flash memory cell stores data as the threshold voltage of a floating gate transistor. The threshold voltage can shift as a result of various types of circuit-level noise, introducing errors when data are read from the channel and ultimately reducing flash lifetime. An accurate model of the threshold voltage distribution across flash cells can enable mechanisms within the flash controller that improve channel reliability and device lifetime.
5834868725ff05a97b013ba1	The 27th annual International Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI) convened in Boston, MA (USA) from April 4-9, 2009. Included in this year's technical program was a special interest group (SIG) meeting on API usability. This report summarizes the SIG, emphasizing the primary takeaways, which include a greater understanding of the types of APIs, case studies, and a place to share our multi-disciplinary results.
5834868625ff05a97b011802	Game-theoretic solution concepts, such as Nash equilibrium, are playing an ever increasing role in the study of systems of autonomous agents. A common criticism of Nash equilibrium is that its existence relies on the possibility of randomizing over actions, which in many cases is deemed unsuitable, impractical, or even infeasible.
5834868625ff05a97b012327	Here we introduce a class of linear operators called recursive orthogonal transforms (ROTs) that allow a natural implementation on a distributed control network. We derive conditions under which ROTs can be used to represent SO (n) for n⩾ 4. We propose a paradigm for distributed feedback control based on plant matrix diagonalization. To find an ROT suitable for this task, we derive a gradient flow on the appropriate underlying Lie group. A numerical example is presented.
5834868625ff05a97b012341	This article presents perception and navigation systems for a family of autonomous orchard vehicles. The systems are customized to enable safe and reliable driving in modern planting environments. The perception system is based on a global positioning system (GPS)-free sensor suite composed of a twodimensional (2-D) laser scanner, wheel and steering encoders, and algorithms that process the sensor data and output the vehicle's location in the orchard and guidance commands for row following and turning.
5834868725ff05a97b015c02	We present the framework of delta-complete analysis for bounded reachability problems of hybrid systems. We perform bounded reachability checking through solving delta-decision problems over the reals. The techniques take into account of robustness properties of the systems under numerical perturbations. Our implementation of the techniques scales well on several highly nonlinear hybrid system models that arise in biomedical applications.
5834868725ff05a97b015c07	We describe the implementation of three symbolic computation algorithms on shared memory multiprocessors. We also evaluate the performance of the implementations, point out some of their common characteristics, and describe why these algorithms should be able to take advantage of the large scale heterogeneous shared memory machines currently being developed.
5834868725ff05a97b014363	Programming languages often include specialized syntax for common datatypes (eg lists) and some also build in support for specific specialized datatypes (eg regular expressions), but user-defined types must use general-purpose syntax. Frustration with this causes developers to use strings, rather than structured data, with alarming frequency, leading to correctness, performance, security, and usability issues. Allowing library providers to modularly extend a language with new syntax could help address these issues.
5834868725ff05a97b015c67	Much progress has been made in automated facial image analysis, yet current approaches still lag behind what is possible using manual labeling of facial actions. While many factors may contribute, a key one may be the limited attention to dynamics of facial action. Most approaches classify frames in terms of either displacement from a neutral, mean face or, less frequently, displacement between successive frames (ie velocity). In the current paper, we evaluated the hypothesis that attention to dynamics can boost recognition rates.
5834868725ff05a97b014389	In this paper we present a hybrid cognitive system to support robot navigation. The system leverages the ACT-R cognitive architecture by integrating an external knowledge component for high-level reasoning. Methodological and implementation aspects are provided, together with an overview of the system's functionalities and the results of a preliminary simulation experiment.
5834868625ff05a97b011534	Effortless one-touch capture of video is a unique capability of wearable devices such as Google Glass. We use this capability to create a new type of crowd-sourced system in which users receive queries relevant to their current location and opt-in preferences. In response, they can send back live video snippets of their surroundings. A system of result caching, geolocation and query similarity detection shields users from being overwhelmed by a flood of queries.
5834868625ff05a97b012030	We introduce some natural families of distributions on rooted binary ranked plane trees with a view toward unifying ideas from various fields, including macroevolution, epidemiology, computational group theory, search algorithms and other fields. In the process we introduce the notions of split-exchangeability and plane-invariance of a general Markov splitting model in order to readily obtain probabilities over various equivalence classes of trees that arise in statistics, phylogenetics, epidemiology and group theory.
5834868625ff05a97b012ab5	Existing code update protocols target efficiency and assume correct behavior from participating sensor nodes. This work aims for the progressive, resource sensitive verification of code updates in sensor networks to ensure that unauthorized updates from malicious nodes are not propagated, while correct updates continue to be efficiently disseminated.
5834868725ff05a97b013956	Different robotic tasks can be solved by controlling a robot to circulate along curves. These include, for example, border inspection and surveillance, multirobot manipulation, and pattern generation. In a previous, work we have proposed a vector field approach for robot convergence and circulation along time-varying curves embedded in N-dimensional spaces. In the present work we instantiate this approach for three-dimensional spaces and, for the first time, show the efficacy of this method to control actual robots.
5834868725ff05a97b015c17	Recent advances in both camera technology as well as supporting computing hardware have made it significantly easier to acquire, transmit, process and store large amounts of image data. As a consequence a number of image databases, specifically face databases, have been collected, often with the expressed goal of sharing the data with others. Due to concerns about the privacy of the individuals visible in the scene, data dissemination is particularly difficult for medical face databases depicting patients.
5834868725ff05a97b014cba	This paper discusses a variety of types of non-lexical signals such as beeps, prosodic variation and speaker style changes, and we consider four cases in which such signals might be used to good effect. We discuss the results of user tests to determine if specific types of non-lexical signals are better in some situations than in others, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using such signals.
5834868725ff05a97b015114	This talk introduces new research that works towards an overarching model of natural face-to-face conversation about spatially-located actions in the world, and then uses that model to implement a trustworthy embodied conversational agent to guide users' ongoing, real-world activities away from the desktop.
5834868725ff05a97b01516e	ABSTRACT: There is a need for cognitively bounded implementations of transactive memory \nfor agents. To do this, we use schema theory and tiered social cognition to implement Mead's \nGeneralized Other (1925). We then compared our new implementation, Construct-ML, with a \nprior implementation of the same simulation, Construct- O. We were not able to replicate all of \nthe patterns suggested by Construct-O's results. However, the pattern validity of Construct-ML \nimproves as agents have more cognitive resources, which is suggestive and interesting.
5834868725ff05a97b013a2f	Innovations in the computational and communication sciences have revolutionized the way we talk, disseminate information, aggregate our opinions or beliefs, and even trade with consumers. A large section of the Internet today is involved in creating content by the users, outsourcing tasks to individuals in a crowd, allocating computational or storage resources to users, and generating revenue through advertising. Technology has made this job easier by providing an environment where these applications can run efficiently on the Internet.

5834868725ff05a97b014fc4	This paper describes several parallel algorithms that solve geometric problems. The algorithms are based on a vector model of computation---the scan-model. The purpose of this paper is both to show how the model can be used and to show a set of interesting algorithms, most of which have been implemented on the Connection Machine, a highly parallel single instruction multiple data (SIMD) computer.
5834868725ff05a97b014fd1	We describe data structures for representing simplicial meshes compactly while supporting online queries and updates efficiently. Our data structure requires about a factor of five less memory than the most efficient standard data structures for triangular or tetrahedral meshes, while efficiently supporting traversal among simplices, storing data on simplices, and insertion and deletion of simplices. Our implementation of the data structures uses about 5 bytes/triangle in two dimensions (2D) and 7.5 bytes/tetrahedron in three dimensions (3D).
5834868725ff05a97b01501f	This paper describes a general system which maps from a phonological specification of an utterance Js intonation to a F0 contour. The system can accommodate a variety of feature based phonological description schemes. Speaker dependent characteristics can be modelled and an automatic method of determining these is described.
5834868725ff05a97b013fd1	Uncontrolled interthread interference in main memory can destroy individual threads' memory-level parallelism, effectively serializing the memory requests of a thread whose latencies would otherwise have largely overlapped, thereby reducing single-thread performance. The parallelism-aware batch scheduler preserves each thread's memory-level parallelism, ensures fairness and starvation freedom, and supports system-level thread priorities.
5834868725ff05a97b015021	In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a user interface for SPICE, a web-based toolkit for rapid prototyping of speech and language processing components. We report on the challenges and experiences gathered from testing these tools in an advanced graduate hands-on course, in which we created speech recognition, speech synthesis, and smalldomain translation components for 10 different languages within only 6 weeks.
5834868725ff05a97b013fd2	Concurrent autonomous self-test, or online self-test, allows a system to test itself, concurrently during normal operation, with no system downtime visible to the end-user. Online self-test is important for overcoming major reliability challenges such as early-life failures and circuit aging in future System-on-Chips (SoCs). To ensure required levels of overall reliability of SoCs, it is essential to apply online self-test to uncore components, eg, cache controllers, DRAM controllers, and I/O controllers, in addition to processor cores.

Columns 5-6 show comparison between the measured (5th column) variance ratio and that predicted by the model (6th column). In all but one case, the measurements are very accurate.
5834868725ff05a97b014842	STEM is an acronym for the Short Time-series Expression Miner, a software program designed for clustering, comparing, and visualizing gene expression data from short time series microarray experiments (∼ 8 time points or fewer). STEM implements a novel method for clustering short time series expression data that can differentiate between real and random patterns. STEM is also integrated with the Gene Ontology (GO)[4] allowing efficient biological interpretations of the data.
5834868725ff05a97b01488b	Wireless access points are becoming more and more prominent in the home, yet there is no incentive to encourage access point owners to share their service. We introduce SWAP, a lightweight protocol that uses reciprocity to motivate users to share service. Each node participating in SWAP stores perishable receipts that are used to calculate a user's rating (how much the user shares his or her access point). SWAP does not use a centralized authority to store or validate receipts nor does it place an excessive burden on peers.

5834868725ff05a97b013f0e	Figure 1: The mechanism of the pull-back operation H. In forward generation, a pixel x in the template is pushed to the position W (x, p) in the distorted image by the generating function G. The corresponding pull-back operation H do the opposite: it takes the pixel value at W (x, q) in the distorted image, and stores it at position x in the resulting image H (Ip, q). In the case of p= q, the pixel pushed by G is the same pixel pulled by H, yielding H (Ip, p)= T. Similarly we define H in backward generation.

The Complex Organizational Reasoning System (CORES) is a multi-agent network simulation model that uses organizational, social, political and economic dynamics to generate predictions of the likely actions and responses of these actors when involved in an adversarial context.
5834868725ff05a97b013c70	In this work, we present a general and interactive approach to annotation learning 1 in NLP. Broadly, the main contribution of this work is to use machine learning in the scenarios where there is no pre-annotated data available for the target annotations that we aim to learn, but an analyst is willing to interactively teach the system with examples and guide the learning process with the knowledge he/she has. The data, however, might have some prior annotations that can be used as features for learning the new annotations.
5834868725ff05a97b0151d0	Factors affecting organizational performance include stress, organizational design, and task environment. Each factor also varies along multiple dimensions. We now describe those dimensions of stress, organizational design, and task environment as often discussed in the literature and their connections to performance. We start by looking into the literature on organizational performance.
5834868625ff05a97b0119e2	Conventional recuperating solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/gas turbine (GT) system suffers from its poor dynamic capability and load following performance. To meet the fast, safe and efficient load following requirements for mobile applications, a sprinter SOFC/GT system concept is proposed in this paper. In the proposed system, an SOFC stack operating at fairly constant temperature provides the baseline power with high efficiency while the fast dynamic capability of the GT-generator is fully explored for fast dynamic load following.
5834868625ff05a97b01258c	It is becoming a standard technique to use learning curves as part of evaluation of intelligent tutoring systems [1, 2, 3], but such learning curves require a method for attributing errors. That is, the method must determine for each error a student makes what “knowledge component” in the student model is to blame. To this point, alternative methods for error attribution have not been systematically investigated. We implemented four alternative methods for error attribution–two temporal heuristics and two location-temporal heuristics.
5834868725ff05a97b013d31	Data compression can be an effective method to achieve higher system performance and energy efficiency in modern data-intensive applications by exploiting redundancy and data similarity. Prior works have studied a variety of data compression techniques to improve both capacity (eg, of caches and main memory) and bandwidth utilization (eg, of the on-chip and off-chip interconnects). In this paper, we make a new observation about the energy-efficiency of communication when compression is applied.
5834868725ff05a97b014397	We present a novel neural machine translation (NMT) architecture associating visual and textual features for translation tasks with multiple modalities. Transformed global and regional visual features are concatenated with text to form attendable sequences which are dissipated over parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) threads to assist the encoder generating a representation for attention-based decoding. Experiments show that the proposed NMT outperform the text-only baseline.
5834868725ff05a97b015c7d	This paper presents a method of using conditional random fields (CRF) for extracting polar words and determining the overall sentiment of text. We frame sentiment classification as a feature selection problem and conduct three sets of experiments by using: prior polarity lexicons, bag-of-words classifiers and CRF sequence models. The results show the potential of utilizing CRFs in discovering high quality context-dependent polar features.
5834868725ff05a97b01439d	We present a hybrid system for reasoning over contextual and spatial elements of environments. The system, designed for deployment in robot architectures, leverages a knowledge base framework for common-sense reasoning through the integration with the symbolic and sub-symbolic structures of a cognitive architecture. Methodological and functional aspects are illustrated, together with an overview of the results obtained in a synthetic simulation experiment.
5834868725ff05a97b0152d0	Cyber-attacks aimed at breaking into networks and bringing websites down appear to have become an every-day phenomenon, but there is less clarity on where the attacks come from and who are the top targets. We used DDoS attacks data shared by Arbor Networks, from June 2013 to Mar 2016, to understand the cyber-attacks network. We take a high-level view of attacks mostly considering aggregate country-to-country attacks, using which we summarize the major players and trends in DDoS cyber-attacks.
5834868725ff05a97b013bb0	The paper deals with the following topics: multicore architectures; microprocessor chips; reliability and energy efficiency; memory systems; cache architectures; on-chip networks; system architecture and performance evaluation; processor microarchitecture; industrial perspectives; and architectures for emerging technologies.
5834868725ff05a97b0152d8	This paper reports the experiments of using Indri for the main and routing (relevance feedback) tasks in the TREC 2007 Legal Track. For the main task, we analyze ranking algorithms using different fields, boolean constraints and structured operators. Evaluation results show that structured queries outperform bag-of-words ones. Boolean constraints improve both precision and recall. For the routing task, we train a linear SVM classifier for each topic. Terms with the largest weights are selected to form new queries.
5834868725ff05a97b0152da	Abstract—We investigate the minimum expected number of bits sufficient to encode a random variable X while still being able to recover an approximation of X with expected distance from X at most D: that is, the optimal rate at distortion D, in a one-shot coding setting. We find this quantity is related to the entropy of a Voronoi partition of the values of X based on a maximal D-packing.

5834868725ff05a97b014e1d	This paper describes building of the basic components, particularly speech recognition and synthesis, of a speech-tospeech translation system. This work is described within the framework of the “Tongues: small footprint speech-tospeech translation device” developed at CMU and Lockheed Martin for use by US Army Chaplains.
5834868725ff05a97b0148d2	Speech recognition has advanced considerably, but has been limited almost entirely either to situations in which close speaking microphones are natural and acceptable (telephone, dictation, command&control, etc.) or in which high-quality recordings are ensured. Furthermore, most recognition applications involve controlled recording environments, in which the user turns the recognition event on and off and speaks cooperatively for the purpose of being recognized.
5834868725ff05a97b0148dd	This paper demonstrates how a wet1 designed autonomous mobile robot platform cait be used in a varieiy of robot applications, and how his plnlfcmn can providc a generic rcst-bed for rnhtrt colony research. The paper describes research into robot architectures, integrated sensing, rtihot cnlonies, evolutioiiary neural conrndlers, and distributed sciisiiig and coininunication.
5834868725ff05a97b015d65	For facial expression recognition systems to be applicable in the real world, they need to be able to detect and track a previously unseen person's face and its facial movements accurately in realistic environments. A highly plausible solution involves performing a “dense” form of alignment, where 60-70 fiducial facial points are tracked with high accuracy. The problem is that, in practice, this type of dense alignment had so far been impossible to achieve in a generic sense, mainly due to poor reliability and robustness.
5834868725ff05a97b015d67	The face conveys information about a person's age, sex, background, and identity; what they are feeling, thinking, or likely to do next. Facial expression regulates face-to-face interactions, indicates reciprocity and interpersonal attraction or repulsion, and enables intersubjectivity between members of different cultures. Facial expression indexes neurological and psychiatric functioning and reveals personality and socioemotional development. Not surprisingly, the face has been of keen interest to behavioral scientists.
5834868725ff05a97b01492c	Ssd1 is an RNA-binding protein that affects literally hundreds of different processes and is polymorphic in both wild and lab yeast strains. We have used transcript microarrays to compare mRNA levels in an isogenic pair of mutant (ssd1-d) and wild-type (SSD1-V) cells across the cell cycle. We find that 15% of transcripts are differentially expressed, but there is no correlation with those mRNAs bound by Ssd1. About 20% of cell cycle regulated transcripts are affected, and most show sharper amplitudes of oscillation in SSD1-V cells.
5834868725ff05a97b014930	We prove tight upper and lower bounds of@(t/J-) on the expected number of rounds needed for randomized synchronous consensus protocols for a fail-stop, full information, dynamic adversary. In particular this proves that some restrictions are needed on the power of the adversary to allow randomized constant expected number of rounds protocols.
5834868725ff05a97b013fd8	With the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, we are facing an exponential increase in the amount of genomic sequence data. The success of all medical and genetic applications of next-generation sequencing critically depends on the existence of computational techniques that can process and analyze the enormous amount of sequence data quickly and accurately. Unfortunately, the current read mapping algorithms have difficulties in coping with the massive amounts of data generated by NGS.
5834868725ff05a97b014e03	FramepaC is a frame manipulation and utility package for C++ programmers which has been optimized for speed over ultimate generality. In addition to frame manipulation, it provides nearly all of the data types supported by Common Lisp. Despite the emphasis on raw speed, it still provides a rich set of features for frames, including inheritance, a Lisp-like reader, demand-loaded frames using either a disk file or a network server as backing store, and optionally demons.
5834868725ff05a97b01503c	In this paper, we address the issue of choice of unit size in unit selection speech synthesis. We discuss the development of a Hindi speech synthesizer and our experiments with different choices of units: syllable, diphone, phone and half phone. Perceptual tests conducted to evaluate the quality of the synthesizers with different unit size indicate that the syllable synthesizer performs better than the phone, diphone and half phone synthesizers, and the half phone synthesizer performs better than diphone and phone synthesizers.
5834868725ff05a97b01504e	In this paper, we describe how a research spoken dialog system was made available to the general public. The Let's Go Public spoken dialog system provides bus schedule information to the Pittsburgh population during off-peak times. This paper describes the changes necessary to make the system usable for the general public and presents analysis of the calls and strategies we have used to ensure high performance. 1.
5834868725ff05a97b0139e5	In this paper, we describe the “Spoken Web Search” Task, which was held as part of the 2011 MediaEval campaign. The purpose of this task was to perform audio search in several languages, with very little resources being available in each language. The data was taken from audio content that was created in live settings and was submitted to the “spoken web” over a mobile connection.
5834868725ff05a97b015054	Concatenating units of natural speech is one method of speech synthesis1. Most such systems use an inventory of fixed length units, typically diphones or triphones with one instance of each type. An alternative is to use more varied, non-uniform units extracted from large speech databases containing multiple instances of each. The greater variability in such natural speech segments allows closer modeling of naturalness and differences in speaking styles, and eliminates the need for specially-recorded, single-use databases.
5834868725ff05a97b014012	Modern DRAMs have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. Adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank.
5834868625ff05a97b01165e	Thousands of web APIs expose data and services that would be useful to access with natural dialog, from weather and sports to Twitter and movies. The process of adapting each API to a robust dialog system is difficult and time-consuming, as it requires not only programming but also anticipating what is mostly likely to be asked and how it is likely to be asked. We present a crowd-powered system able to generate a natural languageinterface for arbitrary web APIs from scratch without domain-dependent training data or knowledge.

5834868725ff05a97b015202	Speeches given by decision makers within Central Banks are subject to frequent and careful analysis. However, a systematic process for their evaluation has remained elusive. This paper introduces a methodology for a systematic process in the form of a semantic network that can be used to augment existing approaches. The approach suggests a correlation between the new systematic method and public market securities data.
5834868625ff05a97b011a58	We present BFComp, an automated framework based on Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) optimization and δ δ-decidability over the reals, to compute Bisimulation Functions (BFs) that characterize Input-to-Output Stability (IOS) of dynamical systems. BFs are Lyapunov-like functions that decay along the trajectories of a given pair of systems, and can be used to establish the stability of the outputs with respect to bounded input deviations.
5834868625ff05a97b0125a5	Current note-taking applications have been shown to affect the way students take notes. The impact on learning has not been studied. In this paper, we describe a project aimed at addressing how specific features of note-taking tools impact both behavior and performance. We describe our initial results evaluating copy-paste functionality, their implication for design, and future studies. We believe this work has relevance not only for the design of note-taking tools, but for a broader CHI audience.
5834868825ff05a97b016745	The snakeboard is a well-studied example for mechanical systems analysis, largely because of its simultaneous richness in behavior and simplicity in design. However, few snakeboard models incorporate dissipative friction in the traveling direction and skidding as a violation of the rigid nonholonomic constraints. In this paper we investigate these effects on trajectory planning by evaluating a previously proposed friction model as well as a novel skidding model based on the addition of Rayleigh dissipation functions.
5834868825ff05a97b016783	Spiral inductors fabricated in a 0.18µm 6-level Cu interconnect low-K dielectric process suspended 100µm above the substrate with sidewall oxide removed are described. A maskless post-CMOS micromachining process has been developed for the low-K dielectric copper interconnect process. Post-CMOS process enhancements of inductors provide higher quality factors and self-resonant frequencies by undercutting silicon to eliminate substrate losses and etching inter-turn dielectrics to reduce self-capacitance.
58c90b18c50f90cdd385d03b	We demonstrate a bandwidth selective and wavelength flexible 16x1 MUX/DEMUX device with on-chip polarization multiplexing functionality. Experimental demonstration on data traffic conditions revealed excellent performance for operation in Flex-Grid application scenarios.
5834868725ff05a97b0143d7	It is important to investigate what tutoring paradigms are appropriate for ill-defined domains. We focus on teaching intercultural competence, where asynchronous online discussion is a typical instructional task. We explore two methods of assessing student contributions and delivering feedback: an adaptive support system that provides individual feedback, and a peer moderator from the class supported by adaptive assistance.
5834868725ff05a97b0143f2	We apply multi-rate HMMs, a tree structured HMM model, to the word-alignment problem. Multi-rate HMMs allow us to model reordering at both the morpheme level and the word level in a hierarchical fashion. This approach leads to better machine translation results than a morphemeaware model that does not explicitly model morpheme reordering.
5834868725ff05a97b015ca9	In this paper we present statistical models for text which treat words with higher frequencies of occurrence in a sensible manner, and perform better than widely used models based on the multinomial distribution on a wide range of classification tasks, with two or more classes. Our models axe based on the Poisson and Negative-Binomial distributions, which keep desirable properties of simplicity and analytic tractability.

This may in some cases also include the cover art, table of contents, copyright statements, title-page or half title-pages, blank pages, venue maps or other general information relating to the conference that was part of the original conference proceedings.
5834868625ff05a97b013063	This paper investigates a novel minimalistic mechanism that ascends tubes. The mechanism is comprised of only a rigid body, two O-rings, and a motor rotating an eccentric mass. We describe the underlying locomotion principle of rocking and jamming, without the use of special bristles or spines, and demonstrate the robustness of this mechanism.
5834868625ff05a97b01314a	In this paper, two computational models of ethical reasoning, one that compares pairs of truth-telling cases and one that retrieves relevant past cases and principles when presented with an ethical dilemma, are described and discussed. Lessons learned from developing and experimenting with the two systems, as well as challenges of building programs that reason about ethics, are discussed. Finally, plans for developing an intelligent tutor for ethics using one of the computational models as a basis is presented.
5834868625ff05a97b0131d4	Some robot tasks require manipulation of objects that may be touching other fixed objects. The effects of friction and kinematic constraint must be anticipated, and may even be exploited to accomplish the task. An example task, a dynamic analysis, and appropriate effector motions are presented. The goal is to move a rectangular block along a wall, so that one side of the block maintains contact with the wall. Two solutions that push the block along the wall are discussed.
5834868625ff05a97b0131d7	This paper summarizes ongoing work with a mobile manipulator (Mobipulator). We describe the system architecture of the latest version of the robot, a hierarchy of robot motion commands (the Mobipulation library) that can be snapped together to generate complicated paths easily, a configuration space planner that plans wheel motions to manipulate paper, and a visual servoing system to monitor and correct errors in robot motion.
58c90c36c50f90cdd385d0eb	We demonstrate a self-synchronization sub-system that produces bit and packet-level signals to all-optical label-switched nodes. The circuit uses a comb-generating filter and two integrated optical gates and operates with asynchronous and variable-length packets.
58cb14f7c50f90cdd3871fbb	Data-driven approaches to machine translation often rely heavily on large training corpora. We are developing a translation system targeted specifically at minority languages for which such large corpora are not usually available. Instead, we elicit a controlled corpus from a native speaker. The elicited sentences are used to learn transfer rules using a seeded version space learning algorithm. We describe the theoretical framework of this approach, and provide some preliminary solutions.
58cb15ffc50f90cdd3872070	Rotorcraft operating in unprepared locations must be capable of safe flight in the presence of unmapped obstacles and absence of GPS, and must be able to quickly and reliably assess a potential landing zone's suitability for landing. This paper presents technologies that address these needs and the result of their application to an actual unmanned helicopter prototype.

5834868825ff05a97b0163e7	This supplemental material provides details on the symbolic kinematics algorithm described in the main paper. In particular, we formulate three recursive reconstruction rules that allow us to treat all joints of a planar linkage in a unified manner. Furthermore, we provide the derivatives of these rules wrt the initial joint locations.
58cb2a87c50f90cdd3872e60	Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) play a key role in the automated synthesis and formal verification of digital systems. They are the state-of-the-art data structure for representing switching functions in various branches of electronic design automation. In the following we discuss the properties of this data structure, characterize its algorithmic behaviour, and describe some prominent applications.
58ca378bc50f90cdd38689c5	A client video player device downloads video content from a video content delivery network as segments encoded at respective bitrates selected from distinct encoding bitrates. Bitrate adaptation logic within the client video player selects the appropriate bitrate segment in order to maximize user-perceived Quality-of-Experience. An optimization of this bitrate adaptation logic implementing model predictive control that maximizes the user-perceived Quality-of-Experience is presented.
5834868725ff05a97b013b89	A user inte~ ace tool is any software that helps user interfaee designers or programmers design, implement and test user interfaces and user interfaee software. Whereas five years ago, user interface tools were primarily research projeets, today there are literally hundreds of successful commercial user interface tools. In addition, research into new techniques and tools is extremely active, with one or two sessions at each CHI conference, and an entire sepamte conference (UIST) devoted to this topic every year.
5834868725ff05a97b0142b1	Data-intensive applications seek to obtain trill insights in real-time by analyzing a combination of historical data sets alongside recently collected data. This means that to support such hybrid workloads, database management systems (DBMSs) need to handle both fast ACID transactions and complex analytical queries on the same database. But the current trend is to use specialized systems that are optimized for only one of these workloads, and thus require an organization to maintain separate copies of the database.
5834868825ff05a97b0163ed	We describe a simple controller for stabilizing the center of mass of an articulated bipedal character. We demonstrate the versatility of our balance controller with a range of simulated scenarios, including the effects of noise, reacting to projectiles, and the use of unstable and inclined ground surfaces. We also make a first attempt at analyzing the simulated control strategies in an effort to design a feedback law for in-place balancing.
58d0553bc50f90cdd38a274f	Understanding the neuromuscular control of human locomotion has the potential to deliver practical controllers for bipedal robots that robustly walk and run in unstructured environments. We aim to understand the control of human locomotion, develop neuromuscular control models that generate robust 3D locomotion, and transfer the resulting controllers to humanoid and rehabilitation robotics.
58d057e5c50f90cdd38a2946	Abstract—Obstacle avoidance in bipedal robots is achieved with the help of sensory feedback and closed loop control. Although computational power increased exponentially during the last years it is still the limiting factor for dynamic locomotion in uneven terrain. We introduce a simple robot architecture based on compliant leg behavior. With minimal sensory feedback we can derive stable 2D locomotion. By tuning a single parameter we can adjust the hopping height which can be used for obstacle avoidance.
58ca572fc50f90cdd3869f7f	The system infrastructure transfers the state of his work to his handheld, and allows him to make his final edits using voice commands during his walk. The system infers where Fred is going from his calendar and the campus location tracking service. It downloads the presentation and demonstration software to the projection computer, and warms up the projector.
58cb5058c50f90cdd3874831	Scaling analysis provides a systematic way to translate the performance of a system from one size domain, operating environment, etc., to another. In this paper, we identify scaling issues and present some simple results in the domain of individual mobile robots, as well as teams, swarms, etc., deployed on sensing missions. Since most robot-based sensing missions anticipate mini-, micro-, and nano-scale robots, our explicit examples focus on scaling-down of existing human-scale robot design and concepts.
58ca58edc50f90cdd386a0bc	The fundamental premise behind Moving Target Defense (MTD) is to create a dynamic and shifting system that is more difficult to attack than a static system because a constantly changing attack surface at least reduces the chance of an attacker finding and exploiting the weakness. However, MTD approaches are typically chosen without regard to other qualities of the system, such as performance or cost. This report explores the use of self-adaptive systems, in particular those based on the architecture of the running system.
5834868825ff05a97b0163f8	Techniques are presented for controlling the amount of temporal noise in certain animation sequences. Sketchy animation sequences are received in an input in a digital form and used to create an altered version of the same animation with temporal coherence enforced down to the stroke level, resulting in a reduction of the perceived noise. The amount of reduction is variable and can be controlled via a single parameter to achieve a desired artistic effect.
58ca68dec50f90cdd386ab6d	Computational Organization Theory is often described as a multidisciplinary and fast-moving field which can make it difficult to keep track of it. The recent inclusion of Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT) into the Social Science Citation Index offers a good reason to take stock of what has happened since the foundation of the journal and to analyze its intellectual structure...
58ce3fa5c50f90cdd388f9f1	The classical meshing problem is to construct a triangulation of a region that conforms to the boundary, is as coarse as possible, and is constructed from simplices having bounded aspect ratio. In this paper we present a fully incremental Delaunay refinement algorithm. The algorithm is an extension of one introduced by Ruppert. The algorithm is fully incremental in the sense that it does not need any preprocessing to find an initial Delaunay triangulation or an initial refinement to refine away all encroached simplices of input faces.
58cb5224c50f90cdd3874973	Visual inspection is the most widely used method of commercial aircraft surface inspection. We have developed a remote visual inspection system, designed to facilitate demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of remote visual inspection of aircraft surfaces. We describe experiments testing image understanding algorithms to aid remote visual inspection by enhancing and recognizing surface cracks and corrosion from live imagery, and key features of the mobile robot platform and infrastructure that delivers the image.
58ca6c7ec50f90cdd386ade1	We have designed and implemented an application running inside Second Life that supports user annotation of graphical objects and graphical visualization of concept ontologies, thus providing a formal, machine-accessible description of objects. As a result, we offer a platform that combines the graphical knowledge representation that is expected from a MUVE artifact with the semantic structure given...
58ca6dbfc50f90cdd386aebe	Agent-based models of organizations have traditionally had a single level of agency, whether at the individual or organizational level, but many interesting organizational phenomena, including organizational resilience and turnover, involve agency at multiple organizational levels. We propose an extensible multi-modeling framework, realized in software, to model these phenomena and many more. Two applications will be given to demonstrate the framework's versatility.
58ce3fd0c50f90cdd388fa0a	A polynomial time algorithm for testing isomorphism of graphs which are pairwise kSseparable for fixed k is given. The pairwise k-separable graphs are those graphs where each pair of distinct vertices are k-separable. This is a natural generalization of the bounded valence test of Luks. The subgroup of automorphisms of a hypergraph whose restriction to the vertices is in a given F~ group, for fixed k is constructed in polynomial time.
58ca6de6c50f90cdd386aeda	In this work, we attempt to address the social question of international migration, and the resulting shifts in country populations. This is achieved through the development of a country-level agent-based dynamic network model to examine shifts in population given network relations among countries, which inuences overall population change.
5834868825ff05a97b0166ff	In order for a smart environment to provide services to its occupants, it must be able to detect its current state or context and determine what actions to take based on the context. We discuss the requirements for dealing with context in a smart environment and present a software infrastructure solution we have designed and implemented to help application designers build intelligent services and applications more easily. We describe the benefits of our infrastructure through applications that we have built.
5834868825ff05a97b016701	Context is an important, yet poorly understood and poorly utilized source of information in interactive computing. It will be of particular importance in the new millennium as users move away from their desktops and into settings where their contexts are changing rapidly. Context is difficult to use because, unlike other forms of user input, there is no common, reusable way to handle it. As a result, context-aware applications have been built in an ad hoc manner, making it difficult to build new applications or evolve existing ones.
5834868825ff05a97b016702	We describe the Conference Assistant, a prototype mobile, context-aware application that assists conference attendees. We discuss the strong relationship between context-awareness and wearable computing and apply this relationship in the Conference Assistant. The application uses a wide variety of contexts and enhances user interactions with both the environment and other users. We describe how the application is used and the context-aware architecture on which it is based.
58c8f14ec50f90cdd385c0b0	Conventional microphone array processing schemes used for speech recognition enhance the output waveform using optimization criteria that are independent of the recognition system. We present a new filter-and-sum array processing algorithm in which the filter parameters are calibrated to maximize recognizer likelihoods. The proposed method provides significant improvement in recognition accuracy over conventional methods.
58c8f1f0c50f90cdd385c113	To give you a preview of IEEE Pervasive Computing's October-December special issue on wearable computing, this installment of Notes from the Community focuses on submissions about wearables. The topics range from the origins of wearable computing to unusual examples of wearables, and from emerging uses to wearables in popular culture.
58c8f248c50f90cdd385c14a	Several properties differentiate ultrasonic Doppler sensing from other sensing techniques-high frame rate, low computational overhead, instantaneous velocity readings, and range independence. Also, because it isn't vision-based, it might open doors to sensing in once taboo locations.
58c8f55fc50f90cdd385c31d	We present an algorithm for the separation of multiple speakers from mixed single-channel recordings by latent variable decomposition of the speech spectrogram. We model each magnitude spectral vector in the short-time Fourier transform of a speech signal as the outcome of a discrete random process that generates frequency bin indices. The distribution of the process is modeled as a mixture of multinomial distributions, such that the mixture weights of the component multinomials vary from analysis window to analysis window.
58c8f624c50f90cdd385c38f	In most real-world audio recordings, we encounter several types of audio events. In this paper, we develop a technique for detecting signature audio events, that is based on identifying patterns of occurrences of automatically learned atomic units of sound, which we call Acoustic Unit Descriptors or AUDs. Experiments show that the methodology works as well for detection of individual events and their boundaries in complex recordings.
58c8fb1fc50f90cdd385c69c	This paper presents a family of probabilistic latent variable models that can be used for analysis of nonnegative data. We show that there are strong ties between nonnegative matrix factorization and this family, and provide some straightforward extensions which can help in dealing with shift invariances, higher-order decompositions and sparsity constraints. We argue through these extensions that the use of this approach allows for rapid development of complex statistical models for analyzing nonnegative data.
58cf2a36c50f90cdd38973ac	A beam energy harvester made of an aluminum substrate surface bonded with piezoelectric patches and a stack actuator is developed to achieve an efficient energy harvesting technology with a new developed frequency self-tuning process. To accomplish the self-tuning process, an adjustable axial force applied to the energy harvester is generated by the piezoelectric stack actuator. The stack actuator is controlled by a charged voltage on a small tuning capacitor, which is connected to and charged by the harvester.
5834868825ff05a97b016720	In this work, we look at the problem of multi-class image classification in a semi-supervised learning framework. Given a small set of labeled images, and a much larger set of unlabeled images, we propose a semi-supervised learning method based on bootstrapping that uses independent and discriminating evaluators to overcome semantic drift. Results show the usefulness of an evaluator in learning difficult examples.
58c8fed6c50f90cdd385c8dc	We introduce a novel approach for resolving coreference when the trigger word refers to multiple (sometimes non-contiguous) clauses. Our approach is completely unsupervised, and our experiments show that Neural Network models perform much better (about 20% more accurate) than traditional feature-rich baseline models. We also present a new dataset for Biomedical Language Processing which, with only about 25% of the original corpus vocabulary, still captures the essential distributional semantics of the corpus.
58d076b1c50f90cdd38a3fcb	In addition to the invited talks and contributed talks there were two evening sessions, one on mechanized reasoning and a panel on concurrency theory and the Web. Also, during the symposium there were two demonstrations: one on the Join-Calculus and one on the Linear Logic Sequent Prover.
5834868825ff05a97b016182	Rhinosporidiosis usually affects the mucous membrane of nose and conjunctiva, less frequently lacrimal sac, urethra, and skin. This is a case presentation of rare lacrimal sac rhinosporidiosis for the first time reported from the state of Tripura in North East India. Diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis is usually made by routine histological examination and treatment is surgical excision. It needs follow up as recurrence is common.

The authors reported some of the material in this technical report in an earlier technical report [70].
58d07721c50f90cdd38a401b	We describe the integration of MLRISC, a “generic” compiler back end, with TIL, a type-directed compiler for Standard ML. The TIL run-time system uses a form of type information to enable partially tag-free garbage collection. We show how we propagate this information through the final phases of the compiler, even though the back end is unaware of the existence of this information. Additionally, we identify the characteristics of MLRISC that enable us to use it with TIL and suggest ways in which it might better support our compiler.
5834868825ff05a97b01696d	We have designed and fabricated a novel MEMS biosensing device that consists of resonant composite mesh structures capable of detecting target analyte molecules. The computer-aided design of our MEMS microchip involves the layout of each mechanical mesh sensing structure along with the integrated electronic instrumentation and control elements. Each suspended mesh structure can be electrostatically driven at resonance by applied a voltage between the composite metal mesh and the underlying silicon substrate.
58d0b3aec50f90cdd38a6c52	A proof of the soundness of Tofte's imperative type discipline with respect to a structured operational semantics is given. The presentation is based on a semantic formalism that combines the benefits of the approaches considered by Wright and Felleisen, and by Tofte, leading to a particularly simple proof of soundness of Tofte's type discipline.
58d0b4e2c50f90cdd38a6d37	An extension of Standard ML with continuation primitives similar to those found in Scheme is considered. A number of alternative type systems are discussed, and several programming examples are given. The semantics of type assignment for a small, purely functional fragment of the language is presented, for which both a Milner-style soundness theorem and an observational soundness theorem may be established.

58ce402ac50f90cdd388fa3a	Methods for solving sparse linear systems of equations can be categorized under two broad classes-direct and iterative. Direct methods are methods based on gaussian elimination. This report discusses one such direct method namely Nested dissection. Nested Dissection, originally proposed by Alan George, is a technique for solving sparse linear systems efficiently. This report is a survey of some of the work in the area of nested dissection and attempts to put it together using a common framework.
5834868825ff05a97b016401	This paper introduces a method to simultaneously optimize design and control parameters for legged robots to improve the performance of locomotion based tasks. The morphology of a quadrupedal robot was optimized for a trotting and bounding gait to achieve a certain speed while tuning the control parameters of a robust locomotion controller at the same time. The results of the optimization show that a change of the structure of the robot can help increase its admissable top speed while using the same actuation units.
58ce4052c50f90cdd388fa50	An O (log n) time, n processor randomized algorithm for computing the k-nearest neighbor graph of n points in d dimensions, for fixed d and k is presented. The method is based on the use of sphere separators. Probability bounds are proved using the moment generating function technique.
5834868825ff05a97b016403	Metabrushes for digital painting (such as 3D painting) are provided. Metabrushes may be defined by 3D paint strokes embedded on an elementary piece of geometry. Paint strokes are replicated in 3D over a user's painting gesture, allowing a fast embedding of numerous strokes using only a few user input gestures. Hierarchical metabrushes are further provided for providing faster and more diverse creation of digital paintings.

58ce4098c50f90cdd388fa75	Many important phenomena in science and engineering, including our motivating problem of microstructural blood flow, can be modeled as flows with dynamic interfaces. The major challenge faced in simulating such flows is resolving the interfacial motion. Lagrangian methods are ideally suited for such problems, since interfaces are naturally represented and propagated. However, the material description of motion results in dynamic meshes, which become hopelessly distorted unless they are regularly regenerated.
5834868825ff05a97b016970	Developments in CMOS MEMS have the potential to expand functionality and reduce the power consumption of RF integrated circuits. Post-CMOS micromachining of the substrate improves quality factor of on-chip inductors. Using the same process, area efficient electrothermal actuation is exploited to create RF MEMS capacitors with a large tuning range. Primary applications are in low-power widely tunable voltage-controlled oscillators and reconfigurable filter networks.
5834868825ff05a97b0168ac	How can we correlate the neural activity in the human brain as it responds to typed words, with properties of these terms (like 'edible','fits in hand')? In short, we want to find latent variables, that jointly explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses. This is one of many settings of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization (CMTF) problem.
58cb6cf2c50f90cdd3875c0e	In this paper, we present an algorithm for synthesizing intermediate views from a single stereo-pair. The key contributions of this algorithm are the incorporation of scene assumptions and a disparity estimation confidence measure that lead to the accurate synthesis of occluded and ambiguously referenced regions. The synthesized views have been displayed on a multi-view binocular imaging system, with subjectively effective motion parallax and diminished eye strain.

58ce40d9c50f90cdd388fa97	It is my pleasure to welcome you to the posters track of ICGSE 2016. The goal of this track is to provide a forum to showcase new and exciting ideas in the field of global software engineering. Posters give authors a unique opportunity to make their work highly visible during the conference and get feedback from the community on ongoing work.
58cacc48c50f90cdd386eef5	Abstract—Designing cyber-physical systems (CPSs) increasingly requires the use of multi-domain models throughout the development process. Ensuring consistent relationships between various system models is an important part of an integrated design methodology. This paper describes an architectural approach to reasoning about relations between heterogeneous system models. The run-time base architecture of the system is used as a unifying representation to compare the structure and semantics of the associated models.
58ce410bc50f90cdd388fab4	In this paper we show that every 2-connected embedded planar graph with faces of sizes d 1..... df has a simple cycle separator of size 1.58 d_1^ 2+ ⋯+ d_f^ 2 and we give an almost linear time algorithm for finding these separators, O (no (n, n)). We show that the new upper bound expressed as a function of‖ G‖= d_1^ 2+ ⋯+ d_f^ 2 is no larger, up to a constant factor than previous bounds that where expressed in terms of d ⋅ v where d is the maximum face size and ν is the number of vertices and is much smaller for many graphs.
5834868825ff05a97b016844	Two new pattern matching algorithms based on the Boyer-Moore algorithm are presented. Their performance is compared to that of earlier relevant variants in terms of the number of character comparisons and the required running time by exhaustive simulation. Experimental results show the efficiency of both these two new algorithms.
58d05583c50f90cdd38a2785	Motivated by an interest in human-like controllers for humanoids to increase their social acceptance, we investigate lateral balancing for artistic performances on challenging surfaces. Control design for lateral balancing in humanoids has primarily focused on optimal control techniques. While these techniques generate balancing controllers, it remains unclear whether humans use similar strategies. Here we propose that humans prefer intuitive task-space control for lateral balancing on simple as well as challenging surfaces.
58caceeec50f90cdd386f0d3	In this paper, we envision a world where a software engineer could take an existing software system, specify, for a set of properties of interest, an objective, conditions for change, and strategies for their adaptation and, within a few man weeks, make that system self-adaptive where it was not before. We describe how our approach generalizes to different classes of systems and holds promise for cost-effective, dynamic system self-adaptation to become an engineering reality.
5834868825ff05a97b01640b	Techniques for simulating interactions using an augmented reality device are described. Embodiments capture a visual scene for display, wherein the visual scene is captured using one or more camera devices. Embodiments simulate a dynamic interaction between the first physical object and one or more virtual objects. Additionally, a sequence of frames is rendered for display that depicts the simulated dynamic interaction the first physical object and the one or more virtual objects.
5834868825ff05a97b01640c	We present a method for interactive editing of planar linkages. Given a working linkage as input, the user can make targeted edits to the shape or motion of selected parts while preserving other, eg, functionally-important aspects. In order to make this process intuitive and efficient, we provide a number of editing tools at different levels of abstraction. For instance, the user can directly change the structure of a linkage by displacing joints, edit the motion of selected points on the linkage, or impose limits on the size of its enclosure.
58d0f0fac50f90cdd38a9022	We study a general stochastic probing problem defined on a universe V, where each element e∈ V is “active” independently with probability pe. Elements have weights {we: e∈ V} and the goal is to maximize the weight of a chosen subset S of active elements. However, we are given only the pe values—to determine whether or not an element e is active, our algorithm must probe e. If element e is probed and happens to be active, then e must irrevocably be added to the chosen set S; if e is not active then it is not included in S.
5834868825ff05a97b01684f	The problem we focus on is the design of fast searching methods that will search a database of multimedia objects, to locate objects that match a query object, exactly or approximately. Objects can be 2-dimensional color images, gray-scale medical images in 2-d or 3-d (eg., MRI brain scans), 1-dimensional time sequences, digitized voice or music, video clips etc. A typical query by content would be, eg.,'in a collection of color photographs, find ones with a same color distribution as a sunset photograph'.

58cb63f8c50f90cdd38755b7	A pulsed diode laser casting a diffraction pattern shadow on a CCD is investigated as a non-contact micrometer. Data collected with a prototype instrument are compared with calculated diffraction patterns. Computational needs and possible techniques for diameter extraction are discussed.
5834868825ff05a97b016975	As the need for embedded instrumentation (EI) grows in the military community, unique telemetry and sensor suites will be required. The typical path for combining sensors and telemetry is to select the packaged sensors for the required measurements and then to configure a separately packaged telemetry device. Today since die level telemetry systems are emerging, it should be considered that sensor suites are integrated at the die level with the telemetry components into a miniature and low power EI system.

58d0f5bec50f90cdd38a9273	In a recent paper, Ajtai et al.[1] give a streaming algorithm to count the number of inversions in a stream Lε [m] n using two passes and O (ε− 1-√ n log n (log m+ log n)) space. Here, we present a simple randomized streaming algorithm for the same problem that uses one pass and O (ε− 3 log 2 n log m) space. Our algorithm is based on estimating quantiles of the items already seen in the stream, and using that to estimate the number of inversions involving each element.
58ce4171c50f90cdd388faec	In this paper we present a Delaunay refinement algorithm for generating good aspect ratio and optimal size triangulations. This is the first algorithm known to have sub-quadratic running time. The algorithm is based on the extremely popular Delaunay refinement algorithm of Ruppert. We know of no prior refinement algorithm with an analyzed subquadratic time bound. For many natural classes of meshing problems, our time bounds are comparable to know bounds for quadtree methods.
58c8f78dc50f90cdd385c468	A method decomposes input data acquired of a signal. An input signal is sampled to acquire input data. The input data is represented as a probability distribution. An expectation-maximization procedure is applied iteratively to the probability distribution to determine components of the probability distributions.
58d05ae4c50f90cdd38a2b86	Although current humanoid controllers can rely on inverse kinematics or dynamics of the full humanoid system, powered prosthetic legs or assistive devices cannot, because they do not have access to the full states of the human system. This limitation creates the need for alternative control strategies. One strategy is to embed fundamental knowledge about legged dynamics and control in local feedback. In a previous paper, we have developed a control model of human locomotion which relies mostly on local feedback.
58d05c2cc50f90cdd38a2c7c	In this study, the influence of leg rotation during the swing phase on the stability of running is addressed. Therefore, conservative spring-mass running was investigated using a return map of the apex height. A fixed angle of attack can already result in selfstabiliscd running as found previously. By examining the return maps of all possible angles of attack, a rotational leg control is derived adjusting a desired trajectory within one step and optimising running stability.
58d0f841c50f90cdd38a93ab	We consider embedding metrics induced by trees into Euclidean spaces with a restricted number of dimensions. We show that any weighted tree T with n vertices and L leaves can be embedded into d-dimensional Euclidean space with Õ (L 1/(d-1)) distortion. Furthermore, we exhibit an embedding with almost the same distortion which can be computed efficiently. This distortion substantially improves the previous best upper bound of\\tilde O (n 2/d) and almost matches the best known lower bound of Ω (L 1/d).
58ce4418c50f90cdd388fc5c	How can we detect fraudulent lockstep behavior in large-scale multi-aspect data (ie, tensors)? Can we detect it when data are too large to fit in memory or even on a disk? Past studies have shown that dense blocks in real-world tensors (eg, social media, Wikipedia, TCP dumps, etc.) signal anomalous or fraudulent behavior such as retweet boosting, bot activities, and network attacks. Thus, various approaches, including tensor decomposition and search, have been used for rapid and accurate dense-block detection in tensors.
58c874d7c50f90cdd38576d9	The automatic interpretation of semantic relations between nominals is an important subproblem within natural language understanding applications and is an area of increasing interest. In this paper, we present the system we used to participate in the SEMEVAL 2010 Task 8 Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations between Pairs of Nominals. Our system, based upon a Maximum Entropy classifier trained using a large number of boolean features, received the third highest score.
5834868825ff05a97b015d8c	Multi-Domain learning assumes that a single metadata attribute is used in order to divide the data into so-called domains. However, real-world datasets often have multiple metadata attributes that can divide the data into domains. It is not always apparent which single attribute will lead to the best domains, and more than one attribute might impact classification. We propose extensions to two multi-domain learning techniques for our multi-attribute setting, enabling them to simultaneously learn from several metadata attributes.
5834868825ff05a97b016453	Pervasive 2007 hosted an incredible full day of workshops before the main conference. One-hundred twenty enthusiastic participants in eight great workshops discussed experiences and ideas on particular aspects of pervasive computing with like-minded researchers and practitioners. The variety of projects presented demonstrated how truly interdisciplinary the Pervasive conference has become.
5834868825ff05a97b01698a	We have introduced the problem of automatic lag correlation detection on streaming data and proposed AutoLag to address this problem by using careful approximations and smoothing. Our experiments on real and realistic data show that AutoLag works as expected, estimating the unknown lags with excellent accuracy and significant speed-up. In our experiments on real and realistic data, AutoLag was up to about 42,000 times faster than the naive implementation, with at most 1% relative error.
5834868825ff05a97b0168cc	Given a large bipartite graph that represents objects and their properties, how can we automatically extract semantic information that provides an overview of the data and--at the same time--enables us to drill down to specific parts for an in-depth analysis? In this work in-progress paper, we propose extracting a taxonomy that models the relation between the properties via an is-a hierarchy. The extracted taxonomy arranges the properties from general to specific providing different levels of abstraction.
58d0a9c6c50f90cdd38a64ec	We describe a module system for Elf, a logic programming language based on the LF logical framework.

58cf8290c50f90cdd389a191	Many mobile applications rely on location information gained from location services on mobile devices. However, continuously tracking the device location with high accuracy drains the battery quickly. Furthermore, sensing the same location can be redundant when multiple devices are co-located. In this paper, we develop a crowdsourcing-based location service, E2A2 (energy efficient and accuracy aware), which places colo-cated devices into groups, and uses group location to represent individual device location.

5834868825ff05a97b01641b	We present 'Smart Scribbles'—a new scribble-based interface for user-guided segmentation of digital sketchy drawings. In contrast to previous approaches based on simple selection strategies, Smart Scribbles exploits richer geometric and temporal information, resulting in a more intuitive segmentation interface. We introduce a novel energy minimization formulation in which both geometric and temporal information from digital input devices is used to define stroke-to-stroke and scribble-to-stroke relationships.
58cb48eac50f90cdd38742f8	Purpose A need exists for improvement in the perception of forces by the sense of touch when using tools to perform delicate procedures. This is especially crucial in microsurgery, where surgeons routinely repair tiny blood vessels under a microscope that are far too delicate to be felt by the hand of the surgeon, and ophthalmological surgery where delicate membranes are peeled off the retina using visual feedback alone.
58ce4a7fc50f90cdd388ffd5	The word problem for products of symmetric groups, the circular arc graph coloring problem, and the circle graph coloring problem, as well as several related problems, are proved to be NP-complete. For any fixed number K of colors, the problem of determining whether a given circular arc graph is K-colorable is shown to be solvable in polynomial time.

The trade-off between the number of spares and dependability then is examined.
5834868825ff05a97b016995	We show that the performance of a vector quantizer for a self-similar data set is related to the intrinsic (“fractal”) dimension of the data set. We derive a formula for predicting the error-rate, given the fractal dimension and discuss how we can use our result for evaluating the performance of vector quantizers quickly.

58d0846fc50f90cdd38a49bf	A program is a form of expression that conveys an idea, much as does a proof in mathematics. But whereas proofs have only a static significance, as a form of communication, programs also have a dynamic significance, as commands to be executed by a machine. This places very strong demands on the programmer to explain herself so precisely and rigorously that a program can be run on a computer, while at the same time so crisply and elegantly that a human would be able and willing to understand her.
58cb90a4c50f90cdd3877478	We seek to automatically identify which items to include in a set of curriculum, and how to adaptively select these items, in order to maximize student performance on some specified set of learning objectives. Our experimental results with a histogram tutoring system suggest that Bayesian Optimization can quickly (with only a small amount of student data) find good parameters, and may help instructors identify misalignment between their course, and their desired learning objectives.
58cbd392c50f90cdd387a3bc	To minimize distractions, a pervasive-computing environment must be context-aware. The authors define an activity-attention framework for context-aware computing, discuss the spatial and temporal aspects of applications they developed, and introduce a pervasive-computing architecture.
5834868825ff05a97b016166	Foreground objects of interest are distinguished from a background model by dividing a region of interest of a video data image into a grid array of individual cells. Each of the cells are labeled as foreground if accumulated edge energy within the cell meets an edge energy threshold, or if color intensities for different colors within each cell differ by a color intensity differential threshold, or as a function of combinations of said determinations.
5834868825ff05a97b016912	We describe and compare access methods for documents in an office environment. We discuss the operational requirements of an office, and we survey methods for formatted data and for text retrieval, in an attempt to find an integrated method for both. Comparison of these methods indicates that the signature file method is suitable for the office environment. We examine this method in more detail, and we compare several signature extraction techniques.
5834868825ff05a97b016914	We describe the design decisions and lessons learned from Informedia, a digital video database system developed at Carnegie Mellon University and currently hosting over one terabyte of video data. Informedia is a research prototype for video retrieval by content, as well as a production system. The system has been implemented on a relational database, and it currently achieves less than five-second response times for ad hoc queries by video content on mid-range Pentium® workstations.
5834868825ff05a97b016917	Detecting outliers is an important, but tricky problem, since the preference of outlier-ness often depends on the user and/or the dataset. Existing techniques traditionally detect outliers based on some prescribed definitions of outlier. However, it is very difficult for a user to decide the definition of outliers in prior. We have developed a system of detecting outliers that match users' intentions implied by outlier examples in prior work. In this paper, we propose a new refined method of interactive outlier detection adaptive to users' intentions.
5834868825ff05a97b01643a	We describe the CMU systems submitted to the 2014 WMT shared translation task. We participated in two language pairs, German–English and Hindi–English. Our innovations include: a label coarsening scheme for syntactic tree-to-tree transla-tion, a host of new discriminative features, several modules to create “synthetic trans-lation options” that can generalize beyond what is directly observed in the training data, and a method of combining the out-put of multiple word aligners to uncover extra phrase pairs and grammar rules.

58c8876bc50f90cdd38581ec	A method and system enhances an acoustic signal acquired by a microphone from an acoustic source while concurrently acquiring a Doppler signal from moving parts of the acoustic source. The acoustic signal and the Doppler signal are then analyzed according to a model to generate an enhanced acoustic signal.
58cb9f51c50f90cdd3877ec0	The characteristics of the virtual memory requirements of a sample of Algol 60 programs have been measured. Distributions are presented for the sizes of memory requests and for their holding times (lifetimes). The results are presented in terms of Johnston's contour model and a simple abstract machine. They provide new empirical evidence of certain aspects of the construction and behavior of real programs, and some of their implications for the design of virtual memory systems are presented and discussed.

5834868825ff05a97b0169a5	This paper introduces Videograph, a new tool for video mining and visu alizing the structure of the plot of a video sequence. The main idea is to &lquo; stitch&rquo; together similar scenes which are apart in time. We give a fast algorithm to do stitching and we show case studies, where our approach (a) gives good features for classification (91\\% accuracy), and (b) results in Videographs which reveal the logical structure of the plot of the video clips.
5834868825ff05a97b015d99	The degree to which information sources are pre-processed by Web-based information systems varies greatly. In search engines like Altavista, little pre-processing is done, while in “knowledge integration” systems, complex site-specific “wrappers” are used to integrate different information sources into a common database representation. In this paper we describe an intermediate point between these two models. In our system, information sources are converted into a highly structured collection of small fragments of text.
58cba07ec50f90cdd3877f93	This report consists of two papers that treat reliability of the multiprocessor systems at CMU. The first paper discusses the multiprocessor architectures, reliability features (hardware and software), and measured reliability data. The second paper presents hard failure data from one of the systems, calibrates a hard failure rate model, and analytically models the reliability of the three systems.

5834868825ff05a97b015d9f	Building an intelligent agent that simulates human learning of math and science could potentially benefit both cognitive science, by contributing to the understanding of human learning, and artificial intelligence, by advancing the goal of creating human-level intelligence. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone.
58cbee96c50f90cdd387b61d	2. It should be able to express a variety of features of real systems, for example, timing assumptions and guarantees, continuous evolution of real-world system components, and probabilistic behavior. It should be able to express any combination of these features.3. It should support description of systems in a modular manner. Of course, it should support description of components and their interactions. In addition, it should allow description of systems at different levels of abstraction.
58cf30b4c50f90cdd3897708	Genes and gene expression profiles useful for predicting outcome, risk classification, cytogenetics and/or etiology in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). OPAL1 is a novel gene associated with outcome and, along with other newly identified genes, represent a novel therapeutic targets.
5834868825ff05a97b016a03	A bi-state bifurcation-based control system and method for nonlinear resonators, which utilizes a control loop to servo on the edge of the bifurcation jump, either at the maximum “on” point prior to the Duffing bifurcation jump or along the rising edge of the parametric bifurcation.
58c91d11c50f90cdd385db49	3.1 PURPOSE The purpose of the IRAD was twofold: first to establish that there is a source of risk in the misalignment between organization structure and processes and the architectural decisions that have been made. Secondly, the purpose was to identify and verify low-cost indicators that can be used to identify the occurrences of this misalignment.
58c91d20c50f90cdd385db52	This paper introduces a grasp synthesis algorithm that can use any grasp prototype as the starting point in a search for a good grasp. The algorithm makes the given prototype more effective by generalizing it for a specific task. This generalization step expands the range of application of the prototype to a wide variety of target object geometries, while ensuring that the resulting grasps are appropriate for the intended task. An example whole-hand grasp synthesized for the Salisbury hand is shown at the end of the paper.
5834868825ff05a97b015dbe	We learn graph-based similarity measures for the task of extracting word synonyms from a corpus of parsed text. A constrained graph walk variant that has been successfully applied in the past in similar settings is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art syntactic vector-based approach on this task. Further, we show that learning specialized similarity measures for different word types is advantageous.
58cba116c50f90cdd3878000	This correspondence proposes a model using microcycle and memory read pause times to account for variation in performance between members of a computer family. Wben applied to the DEC PDP-11 and IBM S/360-S/370 families, the model explains over 90 percent of the variation. This model is useful for initial family planning, as well as design of individual family members.
58cb97bbc50f90cdd3877974	We argue that the core problem facing peer-to-peer Systems is locating documents in a decentralized network and propose Chord, a distributed lookup primitive. Chord provides an efficient method of locating documents while placing few constraints on the applications that use it. As proof that Chord's functionality is useful in the development of peer-to-peer applications, we outline the implementation of a peer-to-peer file sharing system based on Chord.
58cbd497c50f90cdd387a473	Three multiprocessor systems designed, implemented, and currently operational at Carnegie-Mellon University are compared and contrasted. The design goals and architectures are summarized with a special focus on reliability features. Experiences gained in design and operation are discussed. Finally, reliability data, with a focus on transient failures, measured from each system are presented and discussed.
58d0742dc50f90cdd38a3dec	The MetaLanguage of the Edinburgh LCF theorem proving system has become a programming language in its own right, popular among a reasonably wide segment of the research community. ML has also become a lingua franca among applied type theorists, as they investigate type systems for the 90's as extensions of the remarkably influential Hindley-Milner type system.
58cb97e6c50f90cdd3877992	We argue that the core problem facing peer-to-peer Systems is locating documents in a decentralized network and propose Chord, a distributed lookup primitive. Chord provides an efficient method of locating documents while placing few constraints on the applications that use it. As proof that Chord's functionality is useful in the development of peer-to-peer applications, we outline the implementation of a peer-to-peer file sharing system based on Chord.
5834868825ff05a97b01694d	Despite their success, most existing methods are designed for static graphs. In many real \nsettings, the graphs are evolving and growing over time; eg new links arrive or link weights \nchange. Consider an author-conference evolving graph, which effectively contains information \nabout the number of papers (edge weights) published by each author (type 1 node) in each conference \n(type 2 node) for each year (timestamp). Trend analysis tools are becoming very popular. For \nexample, Google Trends1 provides useful insights, despite the simplicity of its approach.
5834868825ff05a97b016440	People with recent episodic memory impairment (EMI) such as individuals with Alzheimer's disease suffer from the lack of awareness of their recent experiences. We designed a wearable lifelogging system that allows these individuals to automatically and passively capture their experiences, select and annotate the most salient memory cues from the lifelog, and present these cues to support reminiscence of the experience with a self-guided, memory-exercising interaction.
5834868825ff05a97b016a10	Porous cellulose acetate membranes were suspended over 75 micron wide silicon microchannels. The microchannels are formed when a viscous polymer lacquer is directly spin cast onto etched silicon cavities (Fig. 1). Standard fabrication processes are used to create the channel, preventing the need for adhesives, substrate bonding, or other complex assembly procedures. These microchannels can allow the isolation and concentration of specific biological molecules.
5834868825ff05a97b016a16	We report tip platform platinum sputtering and piezoresistive force sensing employed in CMOS-MEMS electrothermal probes. Pt sputtering is developed to achieve small and reliable electrical contact resistance. Piezoresistive sensors are used to track the force applied on the tips to detect the mechanical contact of the probe and the substrate and to aid in tip registration to the patterned substrates.
58c9f1edc50f90cdd3865fa4	When a decision must be made based on the preferences of multiple agents, and the space of possible outcomes is combinatorial in nature, it becomes necessary to think about how preferences should be represented, and how this affects the complexity of finding an optimal (or at least a good) outcome. We study settings with externalities, where each agent controls one or more variables, and how these...
5834868825ff05a97b016a1c	1The electrocaloric effect (ECE) is a phenomenon in which reversible temperature and entropy changes of a material due to polarization appear under the application and removal of an electric field. Materials with a giant ECE have recently been reported, suggesting practical application in cooling devices. In this paper, a refrigeration system composed of silicon MEMS cooling elements is designed based on the ECE in a terpolymer. Finite element simulations are performed to explore the system performance.
5834868825ff05a97b0169b8	How can we detect suspicious users in large online networks? Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users.
5834868825ff05a97b016471	Automated Teller Machine (ATM) is a widely deployed and used system to cater the banking needs of the user. The idea behind availing an ATM based service was to improve the efficiency of overall financial transaction process. However, in practice, many users with native languages other than English, struggle to efficiently utilize the ATM services on offer. The reason being, even after offering services for more than 40 years, the design of the ATM remained unchanged despite the commonly observed shortcomings.
58d0884bc50f90cdd38a4c97	It has been amply demonstrated in recent years that careful attention to the structure of systems software can lead to greater flexibility, reliability, and ease of implementation, without incurring an undue penalty in performance. It is our contention that advanced programming languages-particularly languages with a mathematically rigorous semantics, and featuring higher-order functions, polymorphic types, first-class continuations, and a useful and powerful module system-are ideally suited to expressing such structure.
5834868825ff05a97b0169bc	Sensor networks attract increasing interest, for a broad range of applications. Given a sensor network, one key issue becomes how to utilize it efficiently and effectively. In particular, how can we detect the underlying correlations (latent variables) among many co-evolving sensor measurements? Can we do it incrementally? We present a system that can (1) collect the measurements from the real wireless sensors;(2) process them in real-time; and (3) determine the correlations (latent variables) among the sensor streams on the fly.
5834868825ff05a97b0161d3	Background P3P was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to provide a standard way for Web sites to communicate about their privacy policies in a computer-readable format. This allows for the development of P3P user agents that can fetch these policies, evaluate them, and help users by displaying pertinent information, blocking cookies, or performing other functions based on each Web site's privacy policy [1].
5834868825ff05a97b0169c5	This article summarizes the Conference on Automated Learning and Discovery (CONALD), which took place in June 1998 at Carnegie Mellon University. CONALD brought together an interdisciplinary group of scientists concerned with decision making based on data. One of the meeting's focal points was the identification of promising research topics, which are discussed toward the end of this article.
58cbd565c50f90cdd387a506	Determining the location of a mobile computer user has several applications. We have developed and demonstrated a person locator using the wireless network infrastructure at Carnegie Mellon University to accomplish this task. A user's location can be determined both indoors and outdoors while on campus, and at a higher resolution than the Global Positioning System. The system requires a minimum of extra hardware but results in a high degree of accuracy.
58c97c4cc50f90cdd38613a2	Abstract—Intraocular microsurgery with robotic assistance aims to boost surgeon performance when operating on delicate sub-millimeter structures of the eye. Fast and accurate mapping and localization of retinal vasculature is critical to increasing the aid that robots can provide during challenging procedures such as photocoagulation and cannulation. We present EyeSLAM, an algorithm that delivers 30 Hz real-time simultaneous localization and mapping of the human retina and vasculature during intraocular surgery.

5834868825ff05a97b016a4b	By 3D integration of an array of 12 nominally identical AlN MEMS sub-filters with a CMOS switching matrix and application of statistical element selection to the same system, we have built a self-healing filter offering 495 unique filter responses and a tuning range of 500 kHz for both center frequency and bandwidth. The demonstrated system enables correction of intrinsic, fabrication-induced variation in filter performance that would otherwise constitute a severe yield limitation to the manufacture of standalone filters.
5834868825ff05a97b016177	Foreground objects of interest are distinguished from a background model by dividing a region of interest of a video data image into a grid array of individual cells. Each of the cells are labeled as foreground if accumulated edge energy within the cell meets an edge energy threshold, or if color intensities for different colors within each cell differ by a color intensity differential threshold, or as a function of combinations of said determinations.
58cb990bc50f90cdd3877a5b	We compared two privacy configuration styles for specifying rules for social sharing one's past locations. Our findings suggest that location-sharing applications which support varying levels of location granularities are associated with sharing rules that are less convoluted, are less likely to be negatively phrased, and can lead to more open sharing. It also results in higher perceived comfort scores, which could be indicative of a false sense of control.
5834868825ff05a97b016956	We describe the FALCON system for handling multimedia queries with relevance feedback. FALCON distinguishes itself in its ability to handle even disjunctive queries on metric spaces. Our experiments show that it performs well on both real and synthetic data in terms of precision/recall, speed of convergence, individual query speed, and scalability. Moreover, it can easily take advantage of off-the-shelf spatial-and metric-access methods.
5834868825ff05a97b01617c	During the last three years, we have developed and described components of ELBook, a semantically based information-retrieval system [1-4]. Using these components, domain experts can specify a query model, indexers can use the query model to index documents, and end-users can search these documents for instances of indexed queries.
5834868825ff05a97b015da6	One of the fundamental goals of artificial intelligence is to understand and develop intelligent agents that simulate human-level intelligence. A lot of effort has been made to develop intelligent agents that simulate human learning of math and science, eg, for use in cognitive tutors. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge for each domain and even for each level of problem difficulty, which hurts the generality of the learning agent and is less cognitively plausible.

58cc5257c50f90cdd387f79f	Social and emotional intelligence are aspects of human intelligence that have been argued to be better predictors than IQ for measuring aspects of success in life, especially in social interactions, learning, and adapting to what is important. When it comes to machines, not all of them will need such skills. Yet to have machines like computers, broadcast systems, and cars, capable of adapting to their users and of anticipating their wishes, endowing them with the ability to recognize user's affective states is necessary.
5834868825ff05a97b01647a	As ACM SIGCHI supports Asian countries to develop their HCI education curricula, we propose to organize an international workshop to explore HCI curricula, teach methods and discuss Masters or PhD programs, and courses for undergraduates. We describe the topics, goals, organizers' background, and detailed plans of all the stages for the workshop.
5834868825ff05a97b0166df	Today, location information is in the hands of the masses. The success of location in pervasive computing has exposed new challenges and opportunities for researchers including making location sensing more robust, accurate, deployable, secure, and developer-friendly. This special issue showcases papers that describe recent research that addresses these challenges.
58cef03dc50f90cdd38955cf	The present study investigates expressive non-verbal interaction in the musical context starting from behavioral features extracted at individual and group levels. Four groups of features are defined, which are related to head movement and direction, and may help gaining insight on the expressivity and cohesion of the performance, discriminating between different performance conditions. Then,...
5834868825ff05a97b016a62	Given a collection of complex, time-stamped events, how do we find patterns and anomalies? Events could be meetings with one or more persons and one or more agenda items at zero or more locations (eg, teleconferences), or they could be publications with authors, keywords, publishers, etc. In such settings, we want to find time stamps that look similar to each other and group them; we also want to find anomalies. In addition, we want our approach to provide interpretations of the clusters and anomalies by annotating them.
58c99e8cc50f90cdd3862a24	Consumer electronic devices are made by the millions, and automating their production is a key manufacturing challenge. Fastening machine screws is among the most difficult components of this challenge. To accomplish this task with sufficient robustness for industry, detecting and recovering from failure is essential. We have built a robotic screwdriving system to collect data on this process. Using it, we collected data on 1862 screwdriving runs, each consisting of force, torque, motor current and speed, and video.
5834868825ff05a97b0166e3	We are exploring different forms of intra-and inter-home audio communication. Though much technology exists to support this human-human communication, none of them make effective use of the context of the communication partners. We aim to augment a domestic environment with knowledge of the location and activities of its occupants. The Family Intercom provides a test bed to explore how this context supports a variety of lightweight communication opportunities between collocated and remote family members.
5834868825ff05a97b016a6b	We design and analyze integrated ways of applying the signature file approach for text and attributes simultaneously. In traditional signature file methods, the records are stored sequentially in the “main file”; for every record, a hash-coded abstraction of it (“record signature”) is created and stored in the signature file (usually, sequentially). To resolve a query, the signature file is scanned; the signatures retrieved correspond to all the qualifying records, plus some “false drops”.
5834868825ff05a97b01647b	In the name of the Organizing Committee, we cordially welcome all participants to the 9th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare held in the historical campus of Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul and the Boğaziçi University are known as places where East and West meet. In this spirit we believe that the Boğaziçi University is a convenient place where Technology and Health meet.
5834868825ff05a97b0169d5	How can we spot anomalies in large, time-evolving graphs? When we have multi-aspect data, eg who published which paper on which conference and on what year, how can we combine this information, in order to obtain good summaries thereof and unravel hidden anomalies and patterns? Such multi-aspect data, including time-evolving graphs, can be successfully modelled using Tensors. In this paper, we show that when we have multiple dimensions in the dataset, then tensor analysis is a powerful and promising tool.
58cef619c50f90cdd38958d9	In their unmodified form, lazy-learning algorithms may have difficulty learning and tracking time-varying input/output function maps such as those that occur in concept shift. Extensions of these algorithms, such as Time-Windowed forgetting (TWF), can permit learning of time-varying mappings by deleting older exemplars, but have decreased classification accuracy when the input-space sampling distribution...
58cba8f3c50f90cdd3878593	Empirical evidence from past studies has shown that current location-based services (LBSs) are not individually compelling enough to drive LBS adoption. To boost the adoption rate, researchers should consider an under-explored research area: the time dimension of location information. We provide examples of such LBSs that share past and future locations. We also describe several challenges for designing these types of LBSs.
58c9a54cc50f90cdd3862f7e	Icons in graphical user interfaces convey information in a mostly universal fashion that allows users to immediately interact with new applications, systems and devices. In this paper, we define Kineticons-an iconographic scheme based on motion. By motion, we mean geometric manipulations applied to a graphical element over time (eg, scale, rotation, deformation). In contrast to static graphical icons and icons with animated graphics, kineticons do not alter the visual content or “pixel-space” of an element.
58c8a9e5c50f90cdd3859692	A method classifies data into multiple classes so that the data in each class have a class-conditional probability distribution. The class-conditional probability distributions of measured data are projected into a likelihood space. The projected class-conditional probability distributions in the likelihood space are then classified according to a discriminant classifier in likelihood space.
5834868825ff05a97b0166e8	Many context-aware services make the assumption that the context they use is completely accurate. However, in reality, both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. In this paper, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments.
58cba91cc50f90cdd38785af	This article discusses the effect of Computer Structures on readers and students. Having a zoo of many computers in one place has been useful to the computer science community for access, comparison, and reference though useful, is not quite enough. The main impact is the understanding that is gained in the writing that went into the subsequent computers, the taxonomy, Bell's law, and the various lines of research it stimulated.
5834868825ff05a97b0176b7	Multicore technology has moved concurrent programming to the forefront of computer science. In this paper, we look at the problem of reasoning about concurrent systems with infinite data domains and non-deterministic input, and develop a method for verification and falsification of safety properties of such systems. Novel characteristics of this method are (a) constructing under-approximating models via symbolic execution with abstract matching and (b) proving safety using under-approximating models.
58cba971c50f90cdd38785eb	During the spring of 1981, the authors were involved in a project to design a single chip fault tolerant microprocessor. The microprocessor chip is now being fabricated by the Multi Project Chip (MPC) facilities. This report presents a brief overview of the chip, examples of the reliability-testability techniques implemented, and some of the trade-off issues resolved during the design process: partitioning of control code into several PLA's, and increase of PLA size and the overall chip size due to testability-reliability constraints.
5834868825ff05a97b0176c2	This paper describes our multi-valued symbolic model-checker XChek. XChek is a generalization of an existing symbolic model-checking algorithm for a multi-valued extension of the temporal logic CTL. Multi-valued model-checking supports reasoning with values other than just TRUE and FALSE.
5834868825ff05a97b016a8b	Fraud detection has become a common concern of the online auction Web sites. Fraudsters often manipulate reputation systems and commit nondelivery fraud. To deal with fraud in group behavior we consider network level features, such as users' beliefs of other users. In this paper we use the loopy belief propagation algorithm and apply it to network level fraud detection, classifying fraudsters, accomplices, as well as honest users. Our method shows good classification accuracy using real data.
5834868825ff05a97b016722	Motivated by an interest in human-like controllers for humanoids to increase their social acceptance, we investigate lateral balancing for artistic performances on challenging surfaces. Control design for lateral balancing in humanoids has primarily focused on optimal control techniques. While these techniques generate balancing controllers, it remains unclear whether humans use similar strategies. Here we propose that humans prefer intuitive task-space control for lateral balancing on simple as well as challenging surfaces.
5834868825ff05a97b016746	Biologically inspired robots perform many interesting and useful behaviors, but to effectively emulate their biological counterparts, robots often need to possess many degrees of freedom, complicating their mechanical design and making it difficult to apply standard control and motion planning strategies. To address this complexity, the robotics community has derived low-dimensional parameter-based controllers that naturally coordinate many degrees of freedom such as the serpenoid curves used to control snake robots.
58c9f88ac50f90cdd3866383	Computational offloading services at the edge of the Internet for mobile devices are becoming a reality. Using a wide range of mobile applications, we explore how such infrastructure improves latency and energy consumption relative to the cloud. We present experimental results from WiFi and 4G LTE networks that confirm substantial wins from edge computing for highly interactive mobile applications.
5834868825ff05a97b015deb	This article describes a prototype implementation of a symbolic model checker for a subset of VHDL. The model checker applies a number of techniques to reduce the search space, thus allowing for efficient verification of real circuits. We have completed an initial release of the VHDL model checker and have used it to verify complex circuits, including the control logic of a commercial RISC microprocessor.
58d05c25c50f90cdd38a2c75	We present a long-range visual signal detection system that is suitable for an unmanned aerial vehicle to find an optical signal released at a desired landing site for the purposes of cargo delivery or rescue situations where radio signals or other communication systems are not available or the wind conditions at the landing site need to be signaled. The challenge here is to have a signal and detection system that works from long range (> 1000m) amongst ground clutter during various seasonal conditions on passive imagery.
58cbad94c50f90cdd38788dc	Randy Pausch is an inspiration to all with his research, teaching, the way he has lived his life, and his courage while confronting pancreatic cancer. This session brings together people he has touched through various phases of his career to discuss his research and legacy.
58d06badc50f90cdd38a3796	We introduce a framework for unconstrained 3D human upper body pose estimation from multiple camera views in complex environment. Its main novelty lies in the integration of three components: single-frame pose recovery, temporal integration and model texture adaptation. Single-frame pose recovery consists of a hypothesis generation stage, in which candidate 3D poses are generated, based on probabilistic...
5834868825ff05a97b016ad8	We present initial findings from an experiment in which participants played Mafia, an established role-playing game, with our robot. In one condition, the robot played like the rest of the participants and, in the other, the robot moderated the game. We discuss general aspects of the interaction, participants' perceptions, and the potential of this scenario for studying group spatial behavior from robotic platforms.
5834868825ff05a97b016ae3	We propose a framework for assessing the sustainability of interactive technologies. Our goal is to initiate steps towards a common standard of measurement for sustainability in the HCI community. This could help motivate green competition, raise consumer awareness, and acknowledge environmental leadership. In this paper we summarize our methodology, our results, and discuss how the framework can be integrated for testing within the HCI community.
58d0aff8c50f90cdd38a698f	An important tool for controlling search in an object logic is the use of structured theory presentations. In order to apply these ideas to the setting of a logical framework, the authors study the behavior of structured theory presentations under representation in a framework, focusing on the problem of lifting presentations, from the object logic to the metalogic of the framework. The authors also consider imposing structure on logic presentations so that logical systems may themselves be defined in a modular fashion.
5834868825ff05a97b01634f	86% of adult internet users have taken steps from time to time to avoid surveillance by other people or organizations when they were using the internet. Despite their precautions, 21% of online adults have had an email or social media account hijacked and 11% have had vital information like Social Security numbers, bank account data, or credit cards stolen—and growing numbers worry about the amount of personal information about them that is available online.
5834868825ff05a97b016af6	In the last part of the 20th century, societal forces and technological advances have worked together to create populations that are living longer, but are less healthy. We eat more, move our bodies less, sleep less, and rarely find the time to quietly relax our minds. At the same time, medical and pharmaceutical advances have reduced mortality while allowing a host of chronic conditions and functional problems to persist. In short, we are living longer, while having the opportunity to experience the consequence of our unhealthy lifestyles.
5834868825ff05a97b016b01	Previous research has shown that design features that support privacy are essential for new technologies looking to gain widespread adoption. As such, privacy-sensitive design will be important for the adoption of social robots, as they could introduce new types of privacy risks to users. In this paper, we report findings from our preliminary study on users' perceptions and attitudes toward privacy in human-robot interaction, based on interviews that we conducted about a workplace social robot.
5834868825ff05a97b016b06	One goal of assistive robotics is to design interactive robots that can help disabled people with tasks such as fetching objects. When people do this task, they coordinate their movements closely with receivers. We investigated how a robot should fetch and give household objects to a person. To develop a model for the robot, we first studied trained dogs and person-to-person handoffs. Our findings suggest two models of handoff that differ in their predictability and adaptivity.
5834868825ff05a97b016b0d	Our research group is designing robotic products and services that will adapt to people's changing behavior through repeated interactions. Through the process of creating these products and services, we have found that there are many dynamic issues to account for in the design: the behavior of customers, the capabilities of the robot, and what the robot knows about people and their preferences. Current service design blueprints are not sufficient for capturing these dynamic relationships among elements of the service.
5834868825ff05a97b016363	We present the results of an online survey of 1,221 Twitter users, comparing messages individuals regretted either saying during in-person conversations or posting on Twitter. Participants generally reported similar types of regrets in person and on Twitter. In particular, they often regretted messages that were critical of others. However, regretted messages that were cathartic/expressive or revealed too much information were reported at a higher rate for Twitter. Regretted messages on Twitter also reached broader audiences.
5834868825ff05a97b016b1b	Phase is an important issue in a vibratory-rate gyroscope for Coriolis signal demodulation and off-axis motion compensation. This paper uses a simplified three-dimensional comb model to analyze the motion coupling and the phase relation between the Coriolis signal and coupled signals for a lateral-axis CMOS-MEMS gyroscope. It is found that the off-axis motion is highly nonlinear and dominates the coupled motions in the comb-drive actuation. The phase relation was verified experimentally.
58d0ef06c50f90cdd38a8f31	We consider the problem of approximating optimal hub labelings in the context of labeling algorithms for the shortest path problem. A previous result was a O (log n) approximating for minimizing the total label size. We give an O (log n)-approximation algorithm for the maximum label size. We also give O (log n)-approximation algorithms for natural generalizations of the problem: Minimizing an ℓ p norm of the labeling and simultaneously minimizing ℓ p and ℓ q norms.
58cbb1a6c50f90cdd3878bb9	This paper deals with the design of hierarchically structured programming systems. It develops a method for evaluating the cost of requiring programmers to work with an abstraction of a real machine. A number of examples from hardware and software are given as illustrations of the method.
5834868825ff05a97b01684b	In the previous section we examined the so-called 'secondary key'access methods, which handle queries on keys that may have duplicates (eg.,'salary', or 'age', in an EMPLOYEE file). As mentioned, records with k numerical attributes can be envisioned as k-dimensional points. Here we examine spatial access methods, which are designed to handle multidimensional points, lines, rectangles and other geometric bodies.

5834868825ff05a97b016b46	A high sensitivity capacitive chemical vapor sensing topology, a vertical parallel-plate sensor, was successfully integrated with CMOS testing electronics. The sensor was fabricated by etching a sacrificial aluminum layer in the CMOS stack and filling the resulting cavity with polyimide. The measured humidity response is a 0.31% change in capacitance per percent relative humidity. The temperature sensitivity of the sensor, an important specification for a sensor exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, is 0.19% C− 1.
58d0f983c50f90cdd38a9446	We present several approximation algorithms for the problem of embedding metric spaces into a line, and into the two-dimensional plane. Among other results, we give an O (√ n)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a line embedding of a metric induced by a given unweighted graph, that minimizes the (standard) multiplicative distortion. We give an improved Õ (n 1/3) approximation for the case of metrics generated by unweighted trees. This is the first result of this type.
58ca95e6c50f90cdd386c93e	A panel session in which issues relating to the effects of advances in faster and more parallel hardware, production system match (PSM) algorithms, and application domains for match on PSM as a research area is presented. It is argued that there is no such thing as the optimal matching algorithm, even for the well-defined task of production-system match and that broadening the scope of the matching task beyond forward-chaining production system presents a new set of problems to the artificial intelligence community.
5834868825ff05a97b016b69	This paper presents a vertical (Z-axis) CMOS-MEMS gyroscope with a measured noise floor of 0.03/sec/and 1% linearity in the range of-360/sec to 360/sec. The gyroscope is fully compatible with conventional CMOS processes, which enable the integration of most of the conditioning circuits. It is fabricated in a three-metal-layer 0.5µm CMOS process followed by a two-step dry etch release. An improved out-of-plane curl matching technique provides the sidewall alignment to 1 µm. A new differential capacitive sensing interface is employed.
5834868825ff05a97b016384	Computer security warnings are intended to protect users and their computers. However, research suggests that these warnings might be largely ineffective because they're frequently ignored. The authors describe a mental model interview study designed to gain insight into how advanced and novice computer users perceive and respond to computer warnings. Developers can leverage the approaches of advanced users to design more effective warnings for novice users.
5834868825ff05a97b015e0a	We propose a purely implicit solution to the contextual assumption generation problem in assume-guarantee reasoning. Instead of improving the L∗ algorithm—a learning algorithm for finite automata, our algorithm computes implicit representations of contextual assumptions by the CDNF algorithm—a learning algorithm for Boolean functions. We report three parametrized test cases where our solution outperforms the monolithic interpolation-based Model Checking algorithm.
58c90e0ec50f90cdd385d206	Background The aim of the present study was to compare Emory Cardiac Toolbox, Myovation, and Quantitative Gated SPECT software regarding the automatic measurements of perfusion and functional left ventricular (LV) quantitative parameters, summed stress score (SSS), perfusion defect score, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), end-diastolic volume, and end-systolic volume (ESV). Methods and Results 99 mTc-tetrofosmin gated SPECT studies were performed in 634 consecutive patients based on the one-day stress/rest protocol.
5834868825ff05a97b016386	We describe our current work in developing novel mechanisms for managing security and privacy in pervasive computing environments. More specifically, we have developed and evaluated three different applications, including a contextual instant messenger, a people finder application, and a phone-based application for access control. We also draw out some themes we have learned thus far for user-controllable security and privacy.
58cbb44bc50f90cdd3878d9c	When designing and using a wearable system, it is important to find the appropriate trade-off between system performance and battery life. Methods currently used for evaluating battery life over a range of CPU clock frequencies are often inaccurate because they fail to account for the fact that overall system performance usually does not scale proportionally to CPU clock frequency. We present a modified method that works in all cases, and characterize the battery life of the test system over a range of frequencies.
5834868825ff05a97b016e39	Mitchell's,(,) candidate-elimination algorithm performs a bidirectional search in the⊳ hypothesis space. It maintains a set, S, of most specific hypotheses that are consistent with the training data and a set, G, of most general hypotheses consistent with the training data. Tese two sets form two boundaries on the version space. See⊳ Learning as Search.
5834868825ff05a97b016ee0	At the present time, it can be a significant challenge to build a large-scale distributed file system that simultaneously maintains both high availability and high performance. Although many fault tolerance technologies have been proposed and used in both commercial and academic distributed file systems to achieve high availability, most of them typically sacrifice performance for higher system availability. Additionally, recent studies show that system availability and performance are related to the system workload.
5834868825ff05a97b016ee1	Today's high-end computing systems are facing a crisis of high failure rates due to increased numbers of components. Recent studies have shown that traditional fault tolerant techniques incur overheads that more than double execution times on these highly parallel machines. Future high-end computing must be able to provide adequate fault tolerance at an acceptable cost or the burdens of fault management will severely affect the viability of such systems.
5834868825ff05a97b016f30	ABSTRACT: We study the average-case complexity of shortest-paths problems in the vertexpotential model. The vertex-potential model is a family of probability distributions on complete directed graphs with arbitrary real edge lengths, but without negative cycles. We show that on a graph with n vertices and with respect to this model, the single-source shortest-paths problem can be solved in On2 expected time, and the all-pairs shortest-paths problem can be solved in On2 log n expected time.© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

5834868825ff05a97b016f34	Petascale computing infrastructures for scientific discovery make petascale demands on information storage capacity, performance, concurrency, reliability, availability, and manageability. The Petascale Data Storage Institute focuses on the data storage problems found in petascale scientific computing environments, with special attention to community issues such as interoperability, community buy-in, and shared tools.
5834868825ff05a97b016f35	Training large machine learning (ML) models with many variables or parameters can take a long time if one employs sequential procedures even with stochastic updates. A natural solution is to turn to distributed computing on a cluster; however, naive, unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms does not usually lead to a proportional speedup and can even result in divergence, because dependencies between model elements can attenuate the computational gains from parallelization and compromise correctness of inference.
5834868825ff05a97b016f4c	We also show that if a random graph G with vertices {l, 2,..., n} is constructed by randomly adding edges one at a time then, almost surely, as soon as G has degree k, G has lk/2] disjoint hamiltonian cycles plus a disjoint perfect matching if k is odd, where k is a ﬁxed positive integer.
58c90e7ec50f90cdd385d24b	The Robotic Antarctic Meteorite Search at Carnegie Mellon is developing robotic technologies to allow for autonomous search and classification of meteorites in Antarctica. In November 1998, the robot Nomad was deployed in the Patriot Hills region of Antarctica to perform several demonstrations and experiments of these technologies in a polar environment.
58cbb4b0c50f90cdd3878de2	Power seat functions (PSFs) let power wheelchair users adjust their posture independently. The Virtual Seating Coach aims to prompt users to use PSFs appropriately and warn against improper use. The authors surveyed users about their preferences for PSF feedback modalities.
5834868825ff05a97b016bb9	We examine the problem of automatic image captioning. Given a training set of captioned images, we want to discover correlations between image features and keywords, so that we can automatically find good keywords for a new image. We experiment thoroughly with multiple design alternatives on large datasets of various content styles, and our proposed methods achieve up to a 45% relative improvement on captioning accuracy over the state of the art.
58cbb4d8c50f90cdd3878dfe	The combination of sensors, perception algorithms, and mobile computing enables situationally aware systems that provide proactive assistance. This paper outlines the basic components of a virtual coach with illustrations in five applications ranging from reminders to advice to opportunities for personal reflection.
5834868825ff05a97b016bcb	A high dimensional indexing method is disclosed which takes a set of objects that can be viewed as N-dimensional data vectors and builds an index which treats the objects like k-dimensional points. The method first defines and applies a set of feature extraction functions that admit some similarity measure for each of the stored objects in the database. The feature vector is then transformed in a manner such that the similarity measure is preserved and that the information of the feature vector v is concentrated in only a few coefficients.
5834868825ff05a97b016f4d	We have found several errors in the paper [1] and the goal here is to present corrections to all of them. Equational references with square brackets [..] are with respect to the published version. Those with round brackets (..) are with respect to this comment. The notation is from [1]. There was a substantial error in the proof of [15](in Section 11.4. 1 of [1]) and a trivial error in the calculation to the proof of [8](in Section 9 of [1]). These are corrected in Sections 1 and 2, respectively of the current note.
5834868825ff05a97b016e5d	The reliability of the confidence score is very important in Spoken Dialog System performance. This paper describes a set of experiments with previously collected off-line data, regarding the set of features that should be used in the computation of the confidence score. Three different regression methods to weight the features were used and the results show that the incorporation of the confidence score given by the speech recognizer improves the confidence measure.
5834868825ff05a97b016f6d	Let C [i, j] be an n× n symmetric matrix where the C [i, j], i≤ j are independent uniform [0, 1] random variables. Let F be the minimum weight 2-factor using C as weights. How any cycles σ (F) does F have whp? It is known that whp σ (F)= O (n/log n). Can this be improved to o (n/log n)? On the face of it, this should be easy. The number of cycles in a random 2-factor on n vertices has O (log n) cycles. A positive result will simplify algorithms for finding low cost traveling salesman problems with these weights.
5834868825ff05a97b016fee	Assume that the edges of the complete graph $ K_n $ are given independent uniform $[0, 1] $ edges weights. We consider the expected minimum total weight $\\mu_k $ of $ k\\geq 2$ edge disjoint spanning trees. When $ k $ is large we show that $\\mu_k\\approx k^ 2$. Most of the paper is concerned with the case $ k= 2$. We show that $\\m_2 $ tends to an explicitly defined constant and that $\\mu_2\\approx 4.1704288\\ldots $.
5834868825ff05a97b016ff0	The gerrymandering problem is a worldwide problem which sets great threat to democracy and justice in district based elections. Thanks to partisan redistricting commissions, district boundaries are often manipulated to benefit incumbents. Since an independent commission is hard to come by, the possibility of impartially generating districts with a computer is explored in this thesis. We have developed an algorithm to randomly produce legal redistricting schemes for Pennsylvania.
5834868825ff05a97b016ff1	Cuckoo Hashing is a hashing scheme invented by Pagh and Rodler [12]. It uses d≥ 2 distinct hash functions to insert items into the hash table. It has been an open question for some time as to the expected time for Random Walk Insertion to add items. We show that if the number of hash functions d= O (1) is sufficiently large, then the expected insertion time is O (1) per item.
5834868825ff05a97b016ff2	We show that if P $\\neq $ NP, then a wide class of TSP heuristics fail to approximate the length of the TSP to asymptotic optimality, even for random Euclidean instances. As an application, we show that when using a heuristic from this class, a natural class of branch-and-bound algorithms takes exponential time to find an optimal tour (again, even on a random point-set), regardless of the particular branching strategy or lower-bound algorithm used.
5834868825ff05a97b016ff8	It is known that whp the hitting time $\\tau_ {2\\sigma} $ for the random graph process to have minimum degree $2\\sigma $ coincides with the hitting time for $\\sigma $ edge disjoint Hamilton cycles,\\cite {BF},\\cite {KS},\\cite {KO}. In this paper we prove an online version of this property. We show that, for a fixed integer $\\sigma\\geq 2$, if random edges of $ K_n $ are presented one by one then whp it is possible to color the edges online with $\\sigma $ colors so that at time $\\tau_ {2\\sigma} $, each color class is Hamiltonian.
5834868825ff05a97b016bd0	The task of grouping word definitions from ESL (English as a Second Language) dictionaries based on the similarity of their meanings is the focus of this work. It is demonstrated that lexical features and unsupervised machine learning algorithms can be effectively used to approach this problem. Analysis of the efficacy of this methodology for this task and the involved data which consists of very short and very few definitions per group is provided.
5834868825ff05a97b016bd6	The Dialog Research Center at Carnegie Mellon (DialRC) is organizing the REAL Challenge. The goal of the REAL Challenge (dialrc. org/realchallenge) is to build speech systems that are used regularly by real users to accomplish real tasks. These systems will give the speech and spoken dialog communities steady streams of research data as well as platforms they can use to carry out studies. It will engage both seasoned researchers and high school and undergrad students in an effort to find the next great speech applications.
5834868825ff05a97b0169da	We propose multi-modal story-oriented video summarization (MMSS) which, unlike previous works that use fine-tuned, domain-specific heuristics, provides a domain-independent, graph-based framework. MMSS uncovers correlation between information of different modalities which gives meaningful story-oriented news video summaries. MMSS can also be applied for video retrieval, giving performance that matches the best traditional retrieval techniques (OKAPI and LSI), with no fine-tuned heuristics such as tf/idf.

58d08aa9c50f90cdd38a4e61	Human communication literature states that people with different culture backgrounds act differently in conversations. Currently most virtual agents are designed for a single targeted popular culture. We implemented two versions of a virtual agent targeting American and Chinese cultures. We found that users from different culture context express engagement differently.
5834868825ff05a97b0169e2	Recently, we served as consultants to the University of Pennsylvania Law School on the redesign of their website. Designers and client collaborated on the project at a distance. In doing so, we were forced to deal with some previously unexplored issues: how to mediate physical distance during collaboration, collect data from users at a distance, show and discuss work, and how to reach consensus at key phases of the project.
58c88dc1c50f90cdd38585cb	A method and system detect speech activity. An ultrasonic signal is directed at a face of a speaker over time. A Doppler signal of the ultrasonic signal is acquired after reflection by the face. Energy in the Doppler signal is measured over time. The energy over time is compared to a predetermined threshold to detect speech activity of the speaker in a concurrently acquired audio signal.

5834868825ff05a97b015e17	We propose a novel integration of interval constraint propagation (ICP) with SMT solvers for linear real arithmetic (LRA) to decide nonlinear real arithmetic problems. We use ICP to search for interval solutions of the nonlinear constraints, and use the LRA solver to either validate the solutions or provide constraints to incrementally refine the search space for ICP. This serves the goal of separating the linear and nonlinear solving stages, and we show that the proposed methods preserve the correctness guarantees of ICP.
58cbb95dc50f90cdd3879137	The Global Effect Problem is introduced in the context of adapting Min-cut partitioning for Min-cut placement. A simplified version of the problem is solved in linear time by using a new algorithm, the Min-cut Shuffle. A detailed analysis and implementation for the algorithm is presented.
5834868825ff05a97b0171a5	Software lifeguards, or tools that monitor applications at runtime, are an effective way of identifying program errors and security exploits. Parallel programs are susceptible to a wider range of possible errors than sequential programs, making them even more in need of online monitoring. Unfortunately, monitoring parallel applications is difficult due to inter-thread data dependences. In prior work, we introduced a new software framework for online parallel program monitoring inspired by dataflow analysis, called Butterfly Analysis.
5834868825ff05a97b01774a	There has been a recent push in extraction of 3D spatial layout of scenes. However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world. We show that augmenting current structured prediction techniques with volumetric reasoning significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art.

5834868825ff05a97b016482	Human routines are blueprints of behavior, which allow people to accomplish purposeful repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their day to how they drive through an intersection. People express their routines through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines.
5834868825ff05a97b016483	We have developed an integrated driving-aware system that allows us to effectively conduct driving user experience (UX) studies. Our system senses driver and vehicle status, analyzes the collected data, and makes a decision about what feedback to provide a driver in a single Android application. We also propose a graphical experimental authoring tool to plan driving routes and manage UX experimental factors. This research with real-world experiments should have great positive impact on further driving-related UX studies.

Our models use the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and their deltas and accelerations as detection features. The error rate metric favors the simple logistic regression model with high activation threshold on both segment-and event-based contexts. On the other hand, DNN model outperforms the baseline in frame-based context.

5834868825ff05a97b016a36	This paper examines methods to electrically tune quality factor (Q) and cubic softening nonlinearity of a mode-matched MEMS gyroscope. The gyroscope includes traditional drive-sense combs and dedicated shaped combs for cubic nonlinearity and frequency tuning. In addition to nonlinearity, Q can be tuned by understanding the nature of the losses. Interconnect resistances are added to the electromechanical resonator model to capture the electrical losses that depend on the applied DC proof mass potential.

In many applications, particularly those in visual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part, eg global motion, and a spatial signal, eg illumination or shape deformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some domain.

58cba934c50f90cdd38785c1	We compared two privacy configuration styles for specifying rules for social sharing one's past locations. Our findings suggest that location-sharing applications which support varying levels of location granularities are associated with sharing rules that are less convoluted, are less likely to be negatively phrased, and can lead to more open sharing. It also results in higher perceived comfort scores, which could be indicative of a false sense of control.

5834868825ff05a97b01632b	Researchers and theorists have proposed that feelings of attachment to subgroups within a larger online community or site can increase users' loyalty to the site. They have identified two types of attachment, with distinct causes and consequences. With bond-based attachment, people feel connections to other group members, while with identity-based attachment they feel connections to the group as a whole. In two experiments we show that these feelings of attachment to subgroups increase loyalty to the larger community.

In this paper, we show that we can use the “fractal” dimensionality of the data for this. We show that a successful dimensionality reduction/feature extraction algorithm projects the data into a feature space with dimensionality close to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data in the original space. Using multiple real datasets, we show that the fractal dimension correlates strongly with desirable datamining measures.

All inferential activity in an object logic (in particular, proof search) is to be conducted in the logical framework via the representation of that logic in the framework. An important tool for controlling search in an object logic, the need for which is motivated by the difficulty of reasoning about large and complex systems, is the use of structured theory presentations.

5834868825ff05a97b016495	We present a population model for predicting users' next relevant place. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of our population model in terms of the difference in accuracy with respect to users' individual models, which is for more than 90% of the users less than 3.5 percentage points.
58c975bec50f90cdd3860fd3	Clustering under most popular objective functions is NP-hard, even to approximate well, and so unlikely to be efficiently solvable in the worst case. Recently, Bilu and Linial (2010)[11] suggested an approach aimed at bypassing this computational barrier by using properties of instances one might hope to hold in practice. In particular, they argue that instances in practice should be stable to small...
5834868825ff05a97b0176de	Query checking was proposed by Chan [2] to speed up design understanding by discovering properties not known a priori. A temporal logic query is an expression containing a symbol? x, referred to as the placeholder, which may be replaced by any propositional formula to yield a CTL formula, eg AG? x, AG (? x∧ p).

In addition to gatherings and temporal events, this department will chronicle Web sites and other computer resources of interest to historians of computing.
5834868825ff05a97b015dee	We introduce a new method for two-level logic minimization. Unlike previous approaches, the new method uses a SAT solver as an underlying engine. While the overall minimization strategy of the new method is based on the operators as defined in ESPRESSO-II, our SAT-based implementation is significantly different. The new minimizer SAT-ESPRESSO was found to perform 5-20 times faster than ESPRESSO-II and 3-5 times faster than BOOM on a set of large examples.
5834868825ff05a97b016aec	Design is a means to discover and understand the how to best build future robotic systems. One important consideration is how to understand the human experience of use of these systems. Robotic systems that work closely with people are a class of social products, artifacts, services, and systems that create social meaning, social behavior, and social relationships. To understand how to design these systems, our interdisciplinary research group has begun to leverage what is known about human perceptual and social behavior.
58cbaf02c50f90cdd38789de	During the spring of 1981, the authors were involved in a project to design a single chip fault tolerant microprocessor. The microprocessor chip is now being fabricated by the Multi Project Chip (MPC) facilities. This report presents a brief overview of the chip, examples of the reliability—testability techniques implemented, and some of the trade-off issues resolved during the design process: partitioning of control code into several PLA's, and increase of PLA size and the overall chip size due to testability—reliability constraints.

The micromirror is fabricated by a deep-reactive-ion-etch post-CMOS micromachining process.
58ca64e0c50f90cdd386a8b1	This paper will briefly examine how Al Qaeda evolved from an insurgency assistance group to a terrorist network of sophistication and global reach. It argues that Al Qaeda filled the needs of Islamist insurgencies and then developed into a complex system of networks by co-opting other groups, hijacking their agendas and transforming their ideologies during the late 1990s to the present. Al Qaeda thus...

58cbbafbc50f90cdd3879260	This paper describes the development of a design generator. The design generator takes a behavioral description as its input and generates functional level structures as its output. Designs for two behavioral descriptions are compared with commercial designs. On the average, the total number of gates required for the allocated data paths is 15 percent more than the commercial designs. Mechanisms for exploring alternative designs are provided. The design space for one of the examples is extensively investigated.
5834868825ff05a97b0170e0	Given n points randomly selected from a uniform distribution on the unit square, we describe linear-time partitioning heuristics which will construct a matching or a tour of these points. We show that the heuristics closely approximate the optimum values as n→∞. Hence we show that the asymptotic values of the maximum matching and tour are about 0· 3826n and twice this value respectively.
5834868825ff05a97b017212	Let the arc-lengths L ij of a complete digraph on n vertices be independent uniform [0, 1] random variables. We consider the patching algorithm of Karp and Steele for the travelling salesman problem on such a digraph and give modifications which tighten the expected error. We extend these ideas to the k-person travelling salesman problem and also consider the case where cities can be visited more than once.
5834868825ff05a97b016358	This paper presents a method to predict soil traversability by estimating the thermal diffusivity of terrain using a moving, continuous-wave laser. This method differentiates between different densities of the samematerial, which visionbased methods alone cannot achieve. The bulk density of a granular material has a significant effect on both its mechanical behavior and its thermal properties. This approach fits the thermal response as effected by a laser to an analytical model that is dependent on thermal diffusivity.

58cbb074c50f90cdd3878ae2	The structure of computers has been taught for almost 30 years. During that time there have been many changes both in industry and academia. Even amidst all this changed there have been certain in variant challenges to educators. By taking a historical perspective, this paper identifies some of those invariance. The paper concludes with an example of a possible computer architecture course based upon interdisciplinary design that combines both educational and research experiences.
5834868825ff05a97b015df8	Establishing the correctness of complicated asynchronous circuit is in general quite difficult because of the high degree of nondeterminism that is inherent in such devices. Nevertheless, it is also very important in view of the cost involved in design and testing of circuits. We show how to give specifications for circuits in a branching time temporal logic and how to mechanically verify them using a simple and efficient model checker. We also show how to tackle a large and complex circuit by verifying it hierarchically.
58cbb10dc50f90cdd3878b4d	In this paper we present our activity recognition and monitoring system based on the eWatch, a wrist worn multi sensor platform. The system identifies the user's activity in realtime using multiple sensors and records the classification results during a day. We conducted a user study with subjects wearing the system during their everyday life, and compared the activity classification of our system with the user's annotation. Selective sampling strategies are used to save energy and to increase the lifetime of the system.
58cbb2fdc50f90cdd3878caf	MICON's synthesis and knowledge-acquisition tools. Ml and CGEN, provide a design paradigm and knowledge representation scheme currently used to create computer systems. However, the techniques employed by these tools can be generalized to create a synttiesis engine which can be used for a variety of engineering design problems. This paper describes the design of a domain independent Ml and CGEN. Two example applications in mechanical design and design environments are presented.
58cbb31cc50f90cdd3878cc4	A simple and effective parallel algorithm to color the nodes of a graph is presented. The algorithm is useful in its own right. It also provides a vehicle to demonstrate the tradeoffs between performance and speed implicit in many parallel algorithms. The algorithm is used when the parallel machine has at least as many processors as there are nodes to color.

A MEMS variable capacitor, capable of 7∶ 1 tuning ratio, reconfigures a narrow-band low-noise amplifier and a power amplifier over a 1 GHz frequency range. A suspended MEMS inductor, with≫ 50% improvement in Q, lowers amplifier power consumption.

In particular, the present invention describes intelligent (eg, microprocessor controlled) foot prostheses configured to actively store and release energy associated with walking. The foot prostheses of the present invention reduce the energy required during ambulation for amputees requiring foot prostheses.
5834868825ff05a97b016b56	Temperature sensitive curling is commonly observed in MEMS structures fabricated using a standard CMOS process. In this paper, a macromodel for vertical and lateral curling effects is derived by extending thermal multimorph theory for cantilever beams. Stresses induced by temperature change are lumped to form equivalent force and moment sources at the two ends of a beam. The macromodel is added onto an existing mechanical beam model which is used to build and simulate MEMS in a schematic view.
5834868825ff05a97b016b5f	The design and characterization of a CMOS-MEMS variable capacitor is presented. Measured results demonstrate a tuning ratio of 6.9: 1, a quality factor of 28 at 3 GHz, and a self-resonant frequency of 11 GHz, with sub-50 fF parasitic capacitance. Simulations of two frequency-reconfigurable circuits, a low-noise amplifier and a power amplifier, show the importance of low parasitic capacitance for practical reconfigurable front-end designs.
5834868825ff05a97b015e18	We describe several observations regarding the completeness and the complexity of bounded model checking and propose techniques to solve some of the associated computational challenges. We begin by defining the completeness threshold (CT) problem: for every finite model M and an LTL property?, there exists a number CT such that if there is no counterexample to? in M of length CT or less, then M ⊨?. Finding this number, if it is sufficiently small, offers a practical method for making bounded model checking complete.
5834868825ff05a97b016b82	It is often the case that the set of values over which a B-Tree is constructed has a skewed distribution. We present a geometric growth technique to manage postings records in such cases, and show that the performance of such a technique is better than that of a straightforward fixed length postings list: It guarantees 1 disk access on searching, and it takes a fraction of the space that its competitor requires (55% to 66%, in our experiments).
5834868825ff05a97b015e1b	dReach is a bounded reachability analysis tool for nonlinear hybrid systems. It encodes reachability problems of hybrid systems to first-order formulas over real numbers, which are solved by delta-decision procedures in the SMT solver dReach. In this way, dReach is able to handle a wide range of highly nonlinear hybrid systems. It has scaled well on various realistic models from biomedical and robotics applications.
5834868825ff05a97b016c43	Differences in perceptual and cognitive abilities between the young and elderly have implications for in-car tasks. As a primary example, although in-car navigation systems enhance situational awareness, this comes at the cost of increasing visual distraction and cognitive load. To address these shortcomings, this paper explores the efficacy of multi-modal cues for providing route guidance information. We present the results of a study evaluating the impact of multi-modal feedback on driving performance and cognitive load.

5834868825ff05a97b017113	We study two natural models of randomly generated constraint satisfaction problems. We determine how quickly the domain size must grow with n to ensure that these models are robust in the sense that they exhibit a non-trivial threshold of satisfiability, and we determine the asymptotic order of that threshold. We also provide resolution complexity lower bounds for these models.

D (n, m) is chosen uniformly at random from D (n, m) and then D (n, m) is obtained by ignoring the orientation of the edges of D (n, m). We show that Limn→∞ n evenPr (D (n, 1) has a perfect matching)= 0, Limn→∞ n evenPr (D (n, 2) has a perfect matching)= 1.

5834868825ff05a97b0172e9	Parallel processing is performed by determining sequential ordering of tasks for processing, assigning priorities to the tasks available on the basis of the sequential ordering, selecting a number of tasks greater than a total number of available parallel processing elements from all available tasks having the highest priorities, partitioning the selected tasks into a number of groups equal to the available number of parallel processing elements, and executing the tasks in the parallel processing elements.
5834868825ff05a97b016f58	A digraph with n vertices and ﬁxed outdegree m is generated randomly so that each such digraph is equally likely to be chosen. We consider the probability of the existence of a-Hamiltonian cycle in the graph obtained by ignoring arc orientation. We show that there exists in (5.23) such that a Hamiltonian cycle exists with probability tending to 1 as it tends to inﬁnity.
5834868825ff05a97b016e6a	We apply a previously reported measure of dialog cohesion to a corpus of spoken tutoring dialogs in which motivation was measured. We find that cohesion significantly predicts changes in student motivation, as measured with a modified MSLQ instrument. This suggests that non-intrusive dialog measures can be used to measure motivation during tutoring.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea9	With the recent improvements in speech technology, it is now possible to build spoken dialog systems that basically work. However, such systems are designed and tailored for the general population. When users come from less general sections of the population, such as the elderly and non-native speakers of English, the accuracy of dialog systems degrades.
5834868825ff05a97b016eab	In this article we describe the basis of the Fluency project for foreign language pronunciation training using automatic speech recognition. We describe the theoretical base, the interactive duration correction module, and our work toward adaptation to the way in which the user learns best. We show results in preliminary tests of the latter, and discuss future directions of the project.
5834868825ff05a97b016ffd	We consider systems where the keys for encrypting messages are derived from the pairwise intersections of sets of private keys issued to the users. We give improved bounds on the storage requirements of systems of this type for secure communication in a large network.
5834868825ff05a97b017225	Broder, Charikar, Frieze and Mitzenmacher [3] introduced the notion of a set of min-wise independent \npermutations. We say that F ⊆ Sn is min-wise independent if for any set X ⊆ [n] and any x ∈ \nX, when π is chosen at random in F we have   In other words we require that all the elements \nof any fixed set X have only an almost equal chance to become the minimum element of the image \nof X under π.   Linear permutations are an important class of permutations. Let p be a \n(large) prime and let Fp = {πa,b : 1 ≤ a ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ b ≤ p − 1} where for x ∈ [p] = {0,1,...

We prove that, with probability tending to 1 as n→∞, G r has the following properties: the independence number of G r is asymptotically 2 n log r/r and the chromatic number of G r is asymptotically r/2 n log r.

5834868825ff05a97b017229	Random geometric graphs have been one of the fundamental models for reasoning about wireless networks: one places n points at random in a region of the plane (typically a square or circle), and then connects pairs of points by an edge if they are within a fixed distance of one another. In addition to giving rise to a range of basic theoretical questions, this class of random graphs has been a central analytical tool in the wireless networking community.
58cbbd59c50f90cdd387940b	This paper describes an experiment statistically designed to gather data on designers' performances in digital design situations. Results of the experiment not only provide data by which to calibrate the results of register transfer level computer aided design algorithms but also the variance to be expected among designers given identical tasks. The experimental techniques described here are applicable to other non-optimal algorithms such as wire routing.
5834868825ff05a97b017130	The group knapsack and knapsack problems are generalised to shortest path problems in a class of graphs called knapsack graphs. An efficient algorithm is described for finding shortest paths provided that arc lengths are non-negative. A more efficient algorithm is described for the acyclic case which includes the knapsack problem. In this latter case the algorithm reduces to a known algorithm.
5834868825ff05a97b017799	This paper presents preliminary results in extracting semantic information from US state public health legislative provisions using natural language processing techniques and machine learning classifiers. Challenges in the density and distribution of the data as well as the structure of the prediction task are described. Decision tree models trained on a unigram representation with TFIDF measures in most cases outperform the baselines by varying margins, leaving room for further improvement.

We show that there exists a polynomial time (O(n^3\\logn)) algorithm which solves the associated travelling salesman problem with probability tending to 1 as n tends to ∞.
5834868825ff05a97b015e57	Wearable robots for lower-limb assistance have long shown promise for improving mobility by working in parallel with biological muscle-tendon units, and thereby sharing a portion of the mechanical load of locomotion, aiding in body weight support, or restricting unfavorable kinematics [4]. In particular, ankle-assistive devices target the joint responsible for delivering half the mechanical energy used in walking, and could combat the compromising effects of aging, spinal injuries, and debilitating conditions like cerebral palsy and stroke [2, 3].
5834868825ff05a97b015e1d	We consider statistical (sampling-based) solution methods for verifying probabilistic properties with unbounded until. Statistical solution methods for probabilistic verification use sample execution trajectories for a system to verify properties with some level of confidence. The main challenge with properties that are expressed using unbounded until is to ensure termination in the face of potentially infinite sample execution trajectories. We describe two alternative solution methods, each one with its own merits.
5834868825ff05a97b016ffe	We take this opportunity, which is kindly provided by the editors, to add a theorem and to correct the proof of one of the lemmas in the article 'Avoiding a Giant Component'[Bohman and Frieze, Avoiding a giant component, Random Struct Alg 19 (2001), 75–85].

We describe how to read FSTs from simple textual descriptions and combine them into larger and more complex machines, and optimize them using simple command-line and library calls.
5834868825ff05a97b016fff	Let the edges of a graph G be coloured so that no colour is used more than k times. We refer to this as a k-bounded colouring. We say that a subset of the edges of G is polychromatic if each edge is of a different colour. In this paper we address the problem of finding the minimum number m such that every k-bounded colouring of Km contains a polychromatic copy of K n. We then generalise this to some related problems.
5834868825ff05a97b017001	We study a problem motivated by a question related to quantum error-correcting codes. Combinatorially, it involves the graph parameter f(G)=\\min{|A|+|{x∈V∖A:d_A(x) is odd\\}|:A≠∅\\}, where V is the vertex set of G and d_A(x) is the number of neighbors of x in A. We give asymptotically tight estimates of f for the random graph G_n,p when p is constant. Also, if f(n)=\\max{f(G):\\,|V(G)|=n\\}, then we show that f(n)≦(0.382+o(1))n.
5834868825ff05a97b017004	A 2-matching of a graph $ G $ is a spanning subgraph with maximum degree two. The size of a 2-matching $ U $ is the number of edges in $ U $ and this is at least $ n-\\k (U) $ where $ n $ is the number of vertices of $ G $ and $\\k $ denotes the number of components. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a greedy algorithm\\textsc {2greedy} for finding a large 2-matching on a random 3-regular graph. We prove that with high probability, the algorithm outputs a 2-matching $ U $ with $\\k (U)=\\tilde {\\Theta}\\of {n^{1/5}} $.
5834868825ff05a97b017005	We consider a simple game, the $ k $-regular graph game, in which players take turns adding edges to an initially empty graph subject to the constraint that the degrees of vertices cannot exceed $ k $. We show a sharp topological threshold for this game: for the case $ k= 3$ a player can ensure the resulting graph is planar, while for the case $ k= 4$, a player can force the appearance of arbitrarily large clique minors.
58cca7b0c50f90cdd38824cc	Register allocation schemes are presented that effectively use many registers in the execution of block-structured languages. Simulation statistics for a machine with many registers and a conventional architecture are compared. The results indicate that the average operand access time and the required memory bandwidth of conventional machines can be significantly reduced. The implications of the register allocation schemes for machine architecture are discussed.
5834868825ff05a97b0164d5	5 Summary Table 1 summarizes the performance of our Korean-English system under various conditions. We report scores on the development set used by minimum error rate training since we did not have enough data to produce a reliable test set. Without segmentation of the eojeol, the system performs quite poorly, due largely to large numbers of OOV items in the output.
5834868825ff05a97b016c32	To investigate whether Natural Language feedback improves learning, we developed two different feedback generation engines, that we systematically evaluated in a three way comparison that included the original system as well. We found that the system which intuitively produces the best language does engender the most learning. Specifically, it appears that presenting feedback at a more abstract level is responsible for the improvement.
5834868825ff05a97b016c33	This paper presents the first experiments with an Intelligent Tutoring System in the domain of linked lists, a fundamental topic in Computer Science. The system has been deployed in an introductory college-level Computer Science class, and engendered significant learning gains. A constraint-based approach has been adopted in the design and implementation of the system. We describe the system architecture, its current functionalities, and the future directions of its development.
5834868825ff05a97b016c8a	Robots currently integrate into our everyday lives, but little is known about how they can act socially. In this paper, we propose a definition of social robots and describe a framework that classifies properties of social robots. The properties consist of form, modality, social norms, autonomy, and interactivity. Finally, we provide broad guidelines for the design of social robots.
5834868825ff05a97b016c35	We developed a new model for iList, our system that helps students learn linked list. The model is automatically extracted from past student data, and allows iList to track students' problem-solving behavior in order to provide targeted feedback. We evaluated the new model both intrinsically and extrinsically. We show that the model can match most student actions after a relatively small sequence of observations, and that iList can effectively use the new student tracker to provide feedback and help students learn.

5834868825ff05a97b016ba8	Jagadish et al.(see Proc. ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART PODS, p. 36-45, 1995) developed a general framework for posing queries based on similarity. The framework enables a formal definition of the notion of similarity for an application domain of choice, and then its use in queries to perform similarity-based search. We adapt this framework to the specialized domain of real-valued sequences.(Although some of the ideas we present are applicable to other types of data as well).

5834868825ff05a97b016ce7	This multiple IMU system integrates lateral accelerometers and vertical gyroscopes with signal processing circuits in a post CMOS MEMS process. A direct-coupled continuous-time sensing buffer for MEMS capacitive sensing has a-3dB frequency corner lower than 10Hz. The integration of multiple sensors makes cross-device compensation possible.
5834868825ff05a97b016cea	An in-plane CMOS-MEMS fully differential silicon-fin resonator (SiFR), operating as a cantilever beam at free-clamp mode with a center frequency of 8.04 MHz, quality factor (Q) of 3589, and insertion loss of 33.6 dB is introduced. The resonator was fabricated directly on a conventional CMOS substrate with an on-chip differential amplifier. To enhance the Q, a 2-step silicon etch is employed to harness the high material Q of silicon substrate resulting in more than three times Q enhancement than that of previous CMOS-MEMS resonators.
5834868825ff05a97b016cf5	We present a new energy harvesting technology that generates electrical energy from a user's interactions with paper-like materials. The energy harvesters are flexible, light, and inexpensive, and they utilize a user's gestures such as tapping, touching, rubbing and sliding to generate electrical energy. The harvested energy is then used to actuate LEDs, e-paper displays and various other devices to create novel interactive applications, such as enhancing books and other printed media with interactivity.

58cbc3f6c50f90cdd38798af	This paper considers the problem of automatically configuring multicomputers for use in embedded applications. The configuration problem is decomposed into two subproblems:(1) specification of the hardware components and (2) assignment of the software tasks to the hardware. An automated technique is introduced to solve these subproblems concurrently. The technique is described and then verified on a set of real and synthetic test cases. The paper concludes with a discussion and summary of the results.
58cbc443c50f90cdd38798e6	At Carnegie Mellon, we have designed and manufactured three generations of wearable, mobile computers. Each new generation of wearable computer has been designed within approximately one semester by an interdisciplinary design class taught at the Engineering Design Research Center (EDRC). Over the semesters that the course has been taught, an interdisciplinary concurrent design methodology has evolved. In this paper, we briefly present the design process for the Navigator, the third generation of wearable computers.
5834868825ff05a97b017265	Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations outof-date.
5834868825ff05a97b01726c	The I/O bottleneck in high-performance computing is becoming worse as application data continues to grow. In this work, we explore how patterns of I/O within these applications can significantly affect the effectiveness of the underlying storage systems and how these same patterns can be utilized to improve many aspects of the I/O stack and mitigate the I/O bottleneck. We offer three main contributions in this paper. First, we develop and evaluate algorithms by which I/O patterns can be efficiently discovered and described.
5834868825ff05a97b016c59	In this note, we describe Spark, an informative art display that visualizes physical activity using abstract art. We present results from five deployments, lasting two to three weeks, that suggest that while graph visualizations are useful for information seeking, abstract visualizations are preferred for display purposes. Our results show that informative art is an appropriate way to visualize physical activity, and can be used in addition to graphs to increase enjoyment and engagement with physical activity displays.

5834868825ff05a97b015e8a	Few comparisons have been performed across torque controllers for exoskeletons, and differences among devices have made interpretation difficult. In this study, we designed, developed and compared the torque-tracking performance of nine control methods, including variations on classical feedback control, model-based control, adaptive control and iterative learning. Each was tested with four high-level controllers that determined desired torque based on time, joint angle, a neuromuscular model, or electromyography.
5834868825ff05a97b0172f9	A stub generator for marshalling the arguments and results of remote procedure calls in heterogeneous environments is presented. The stub generator is itself language and machine independent, and derives all its knowledge of source languages and machine types from a set of language and machine specifications. These specifications can be paired in any combination to accommodate interlanguage calls between differing machines.
58ca5521c50f90cdd3869e08	In this paper, we envision a world where a software engineer could take an existing software system, specify, for a set of properties of interest, an objective, conditions for change, and strategies for their adaptation and, within a few man weeks, make that system self-adaptive where it was not before. We describe how our approach generalizes to different classes of systems and holds promise for cost-effective, dynamic system self-adaptation to become an engineering reality.
5834868825ff05a97b0164fc	In this paper, we give a treatment to the problem of bilingual part-of-speech induction with parallel data. We demonstrate that naïve optimization of log-likelihood with joint MRFs suffers from a severe problem of local maxima, and suggest an alternative--using contrastive estimation for estimation of the parameters. Our experiments show that estimating the parameters this way, using overlapping features with joint MRFs performs better than previous work on the 1984 dataset.

In a previous paper [1] we made a number of assumptions about Gd, the most significant being the assumption that d1≥ 3. In this paper we continue this line of research and only assume that d1≥ 2.

The large volume of seismic data is therefore accessed in one simple step by the Linux cluster for computation. While the seismic and imaging data may still require weeks for adequate processing, the object model of storage drastically improves the amount, speed and movement of data between storage and compute clusters.
58cca85cc50f90cdd388252e	Abstract.“The Watercourse Way” is a mostly-music interactive multimedia performance for violin, cello, percussion, and dancer. The work uses a computer to process sounds from the performers, to synthesize sound, and to generate computer animation. A novel synthesis technique is introduced in which the sound spectrum is controlled in real time by images of light reflected from a shallow pool of water. In addition, performers wear computer-controlled lights that respond to video and sound input, using a wireless radio link to the computer.
5834868825ff05a97b0163b5	Phishing emails are semantic attacks that con people into divulging sensitive information using techniques to make the user believe that information is being requested by a legitimate source. In order to develop tools that will be effective in combating these schemes, we first must know how and why people fall for them. This study reports preliminary analysis of interviews with 20 non-expert computer users to reveal their strategies and understand their decisions when encountering possibly suspicious emails.

5834868825ff05a97b016cf7	In this paper, we describe a methodology for temperature stabilization of CMOS micromachined sensors. Temperature stabilization of a z-axis accelerometer, fabricated in a 0.5/spl mu/m Agilent CMOS process is demonstrated. The accelerometer motion is sensed by a vertical comb drive designed by controlling the rotor and stator curvature. The polysilicon layer of the CMOS process has been utilized for heating the device structure to a constant temperature, that is higher than the maximum ambient operating temperature.

5834868825ff05a97b015e00	This paper describes the rst results of a joint project between CMU and IRST whose goal is to produce a reimplementation of Smv. The idea is that this new model checker, called NuSmv, should be usable, customizable and extensible, with as little e ort as possible, also by people di erent from the developers. A further goal is to produce a system which is very robust, and close to the standards required by industry.
5834868825ff05a97b016c9d	We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training instances.
5834868825ff05a97b0163d4	Reference grids are commonly used in design software to help users judge distances and understand the orientation of the virtual workspace. Despite their ubiquity in 3D graphics applications, little research has gone into important design considerations of the 3D reference grids themselves, which directly impact their usefulness. We have developed two new techniques; the multiscale reference grid and position pegs that form a consistent foundation for presenting relative scale and position information to the user.
58cacdbac50f90cdd386effa	Architecture evolution is a key feature of most software systems. There are few tools that help architects plan and execute these evolutionary paths.

5834868825ff05a97b016ca4	We address the problem of part-of-speech tagging for English data from the popular micro-blogging service Twitter. We develop a tagset, annotate data, develop features, and report tagging results nearing 90% accuracy. The data and tools have been made available to the research community with the goal of enabling richer text analysis of Twitter and related social media data sets.
5834868825ff05a97b016d06	RF building block circuits that can reconfigure from one frequency to another are of interest in multifunction radios. Reconfigurable MEMS capacitors are integrated with on-chip inductors and transistors to design reconfigurable VCO and filter circuits. Electrothermal actuation of the MEMS capacitor leads to> 400 MHz change in operating frequency.
5834868825ff05a97b016d9f	The fabrication and characterization of silicon nanowire (NW) array/spin-on glass (SOG) composite films for thermoelectric devices are presented. Interference lithography was used to pattern square lattice photoresist templates over entire 2 cm× 2 cm n-type Si substrates. The photoresist pattern was transferred to a SiO 2 hard mask for a single-step deep reactive ion Si etch. The resulting Si NW arrays were 1 μ m tall with 15% packing density, and the individual NWs had diameters of 80 nm to 90 nm with vertical sidewalls.
5834868825ff05a97b016e57	This paper presents an end-to-end framework for task-oriented dialog systems using a variant of Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN). The model is able to interface with a relational database and jointly learn policies for both language understanding and dialog strategy. Moreover, we propose a hybrid algorithm that combines the strength of reinforcement learning and supervised learning to achieve faster learning speed. We evaluated the proposed model on a 20 Question Game conversational game simulator.
5834868825ff05a97b016dc7	This paper provides an analysis of R-trees and a variation (R+-trees) that avoids overlapping rectangles in intermediate nodes of the tree. The main contributions of the paper are the following. We provide the first known analysis of R-trees. Although formulas are given for objects in one dimension (line segments), they can be generalized for objects in higher dimensions as well. We show how the transformation of objects to higher dimensions [HINR83] can be effectively used as a tool for the analysis of R-and R+-trees.
58cca93ec50f90cdd38825a8	In this paper, we describe a novel approach to spoken language analysis for translation, which uses a combination of grammar-based phrase-level parsing and automatic classification. The job of the analyzer is to produce a shallow semantic interlingua representation for spoken task-oriented utterances. The goal of our hybrid approach is to provide accurate real-time analyses while improving robustness and portability to new domains and languages.
5834868825ff05a97b0164e0	We introduce into Bayesian decipherment a base distribution derived from similarities of word embeddings. We use Dirichlet multinomial regression (Mimno and McCallum, 2012) to learn a mapping between ciphertext and plaintext word embeddings from non-parallel data. Experimental results show that the base distribution is highly beneficial to decipherment, improving state-of-the-art decipherment accuracy from 45.8% to 67.4% for Spanish/English, and from 5.1% to 11.2% for Malagasy/English.

5834868825ff05a97b01730b	Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the system. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to ldquoout voterdquo the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks.
5834868825ff05a97b016503	In this article, we use an automated bottom-up approach to identify semantic categories in an entire corpus. We conduct an experiment using a word vector model to represent the meaning of words. The word vectors are then clustered, giving a bottom-up representation of semantic categories. Our main finding is that the likelihood of changes in a word's meaning correlates with its position within its cluster.

5834868825ff05a97b015e6e	Individuals with lower limb amputation have a high fall risk, which could be partially due to a lack of stabilizing control in conventional prostheses. Inspired by walking robots, we hypothesized that modulating prosthetic ankle push-off could help improve amputee balance. We developed a three-dimensional walking model, found limit cycles at two speeds, and designed state-feedback controllers that made once-per-step adjustments to ankle push-off work, fore-aft and medial-lateral foot placement, and ankle roll resistance.

58ca41f4c50f90cdd38690e2	Despite tremendous advances in computational models of human analogy, a persistent challenge has been scaling up to find useful analogies in large, messy, real-world data. The availability of large idea repositories (eg, the US patent database) could significantly accelerate innovation and discovery in a way never previously possible. Previous approaches have been limited by relying on hand-created databases that have high relational structure but are very sparse (eg, predicate calculus representations).
5834868825ff05a97b016bfc	This paper describes a new spoken dialog portal that connects systems produced by the spoken dialog research community and gives them access to real users. We introduce a prototype dialog framework that affords easy integration with various remote dialog agents as well as external knowledge resources. To date, the DialPort portal has successfully connected to two dialog systems and several public knowledge APIs. We present current progress and envision our future plan.
5834868825ff05a97b016c6c	A handover is a complex collaboration, where actors coordinate in time and space to transfer control of an object. This coordination comprises two processes: the physical process of moving to get close enough to transfer the object, and the cognitive process of exchanging information to guide the transfer. Despite this complexity, we humans are capable of performing handovers seamlessly in a wide variety of situations, even when unexpected. This suggests a common procedure that guides all handover interactions.

5834868825ff05a97b0175ae	We present an improvement to the simultaneous heuristic allocator component of the global progressive register allocator described in our previous work IKoes06]. Our improved allocator decomposes the control flow graph into linear traces which are allocated in the same manner as a single basic block. We investigate two methods for handling the control flow within the traces both of which produce better quality allocations than the simultaneous heuristic allocator.
58ccadd5c50f90cdd3882822	We describe a Machine Translation (MT) approach that is specifically designed to enable rapid development of MT for languages with limited amounts of online resources. Our approach assumes the availability of a small number of bi-lingual speakers of the two languages, but these need not be linguistic experts. The bi-lingual speakers create a comparatively small corpus of word aligned phrases and sentences (on the order of magnitude of a few thousand sentence pairs) using a specially designed elicitation tool.
58ccaff6c50f90cdd3882948	This paper describes a working two-way speech-to-speech translation system that runs in near real-time on a consumer handheld computer. It can translate from English to Arabic and Arabic to English in the domain of medical interviews. We describe the general architecture and frameworks within which we developed each of the components: HMM-based recognition, interlingua translation (both rule and statistically based), and unit selection synthesis.

Our algorithm is simple and the major tool it uses is comput ing a minimum-weight branching with zero-one weights. We also present sequen tial algorithms for the problem that run in time O (m+ n logn).

5834868825ff05a97b0164e8	We present a novel neural machine translation (NMT) architecture associating visual and textual features for translation tasks with multiple modalities. Transformed global and regional visual features are concatenated with text to form attendable sequences which are dissipated over parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) threads to assist the encoder generating a representation for attention-based decoding. Experiments show that the proposed NMT outperform the text-only baseline.
5834868825ff05a97b016c6f	Recent advances in telecommunication and wireless networking technology have exploded the possibilities for remote communication between people. We present a product called the Hug as a challenge to familiar telecommunication products. A visionary design born out of research with elders, the Hug addresses a very human need for physical closeness in remote communications. It uses the same network infrastructure as many appliances today, but places a new face on human product interaction.
5834868825ff05a97b016e7a	We build an expert system to read speech sonagrams, thus modeling and putting to use the competence of expert phoneticians. This phonetic expertise must be collected and formalized while the control structure is developed. We present both the knowledge representation and the control strategy. A sonagram is represented as a matrix of acoustic cues, and phonetic identification is formalized as production rules. The inference engine of the system uses forward-chaining with plausibility rates.
5834868825ff05a97b017078	A new taxonomy for I/O systems is proposed that is based on the program sequencing neces-sary for the control of U0 devices. A review of historical machines demonstrates the need for a more comprehensive categorization than previously published and reveals the historical ﬁrsts of I/O interrupts in the NBS DYSEAC, DMA in the IBM SAGE (AN/FSQ-7), the interrupt vector concept in the Lincoln Labs TX~ 2, and fully symmetric I/O in the Burroughs D-825 multiprocessor.
5834868825ff05a97b0164ea	We introduce QVEC-CCA--an intrinsic evaluation metric for word vector representations based on correlations of learned vectors with features extracted from linguistic resources. We show that QVEC-CCA scores are an effective proxy for a range of extrinsic semantic and syntactic tasks. We also show that the proposed evaluation obtains higher and more consistent correlations with downstream tasks, compared to existing approaches to intrinsic evaluation of word vectors that are based on word similarity.
5834868825ff05a97b0175b6	Many distributed algorithms require a specific role to be played by a leader, a single node in the system. The choice of this node often has a direct impact on the performance. In particular, selecting a central node as the leader can significantly improve algorithm efficiency. Classical distributed algorithms require global information about the connectivity network to elect a centroid node. Thus, they are not suitable for large-scale distributed embedded systems with scarce computation, memory and energy resources.
58cce561c50f90cdd3884595	Much of the work on perception and understanding of music by computers has focused on low-level perceptual features such as pitch and tempo. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can be used to build e ective style classi ers for interactive performance systems. We also present an analysis explaining why these techniques work so well when hand-coded approaches have consistently failed. We also describe a reliable real-time performance style classi er.
5834868825ff05a97b017322	Multi-tasking is now ubiquitous component of our lives; despite the fact that we all can cite an incident where multi-tasking put us in a difficult situation. The reason so many of us do multi-task is that most of the time we are capable of effective dual task performance. Hart and Wickens (2008) have defined the point where one traverses safe and effective multi-tasking to dangerous and ineffective multi-tasking as the “red-line” of workload. In this panel, we will discuss this “red-line” of workload from the theoretical, empirical, and practical viewpoints.
5834868825ff05a97b0175bc	Graph coloring is the de facto standard technique for register allocation within a compiler. In this paper we examine the intuition that a better coloring algorithm results in better register allocation. By replacing the coloring phase of the gcc compiler's register allocator with an optimal coloring algorithm, we demonstrate both the importance of extending the graph coloring model to better express the costs of allocation decisions and the unsuitability of a pure graph coloring model of register allocation.
5834868825ff05a97b01650b	We present a Bayesian formulation for weakly-supervised learning of a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertagger with an HMM. We assume supervision in the form of a tag dictionary, and our prior encourages the use of crosslinguistically common category structures as well as transitions between tags that can combine locally according to CCG's combinators. Our prior is theoretically appealing since it is motivated by languageindependent, universal properties of the CCG formalism.
58cce5a4c50f90cdd38845b8	Annotations of audio files can be used to search and index music and sound databases, provide data for system evaluation, and generate training data for machine learning. Unfortunately, the cost of obtaining a comprehensive set of annotations manually is high. One way to lower the cost of labeling is to create games with a purpose that people will voluntarily play, producing useful metadata as a by-product. TagATune is an audio-based online game that aims to extract descriptions of sounds and music from human players.
5834868825ff05a97b0175be	Chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN) provides an alternative to using Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) for constructing circuits with feature sizes in the tens of nanometers. A molecular latch and a method using the latch that enables it to act as a state holding device, perform voltage restoration, and to provide I/O isolation is disclosed.
5834868825ff05a97b017327	We present a stereo vision-aided inertial navigation system and demonstrate its potential in power line inspection at close range using an unmaned aerial vehicle. This is made possible by recent developments in visual odometry and a newly proposed algorithm for the loose coupling of an inertial measurement unit and visual odometry. Our experiments show promising results.
5834868825ff05a97b016ef1	Level creation is a creative game-play exercise that resembles problem-posing, and has shown to be engaging and helpful for players to learn about the game's core mechanic. However, in user-authoring environments, users often create levels without considering the game's objective, or with entirely different objectives in mind, resulting in levels which fail to afford the core gameplay mechanic. This poses a bigger threat to educational games, because the core gameplay is aligned with the learning objectives.
5834868825ff05a97b016f31	A graph G=(V, E) on n vertices is super ϵ-regular if (i) all vertices have degree in the range [(d− ϵ) n,(d+ ϵ) n], dn being the average degree, and (ii) for every pair of disjoint sets S, T⊆ V,| S|,| T|≥ ϵn, e (S, T) is in the range [(d− ϵ)| S|| T|,(d+ϵ)| S|| T|]. We show that the number of perfect matchings lies in the range [((d− 2ϵ) ν n! ν! 2ν,(d+ 2ϵ) ν n! ν! 2ν], where ν= n 2, and the number of Hamilton cycles lies in the range [(d− 2ϵ) nn!,(d+ 2ϵ) nn!].
5834868825ff05a97b0172aa	Following a brief review of the fundamentals of disk system architecture, the characteristics of the applications that demand high I/O system performance are described. Conventional ways to improve disk performance are discussed. New developments in disk array systems are introduced, and controller architectures are described.
58ccda12c50f90cdd3883f36	A common model for multimedia systems is the stream, an abstraction representing the flow of continuous time-dependent data such as audio samples and video frames. The primary feature of streams is the ability to compose processes by making stream connections between them. An alternative time-advance model is related to discrete-event simulations. Data is computed in presentation order, but in advance of the actual presentation time. Timestamped, buffered data is subsequently output with low latency.
5834868825ff05a97b017329	A pedestrian tracking system using inertial sensors mounted on both feet is presented. Significant accuracy improvements are demonstrated, compared to single shoe tracking, by using sonar foot-to-foot range measurements to constrain heading drift. A single complementary Kalman filter fuses data from both inertial measurement units and the sonar sensor. The system is composed of commercial and custom hardware. Experimental results collected over long durations and distances are presented.
5834868825ff05a97b0175c3	This Conference Proceeding is brought to you for free and open access by the School of Computer Science at Research Showcase@ CMU.

5834868825ff05a97b01732d	This paper presents an analysis of a proposed tightly coupled Inertial/GPS navigation system for UAV applications. An indirect, error state extended Kalman filter is employed to estimate vehicle position, velocity, attitude and IMU bias errors. The indirect configuration linearises the state transition matrix and greatly reduces the required feedback frequency. Standard GPS C/A code pseudo-ranges are used directly to update the Kalman filter. The advantage of this configuration arises in situations of poor GPS availability.
5834868825ff05a97b016d1a	The rapid layout synthesis of a microresonator from high-level functional specifications and design constraints is demonstrated. Functional parameters such as resonant frequency, quality factor, and displacement amplitude at resonance are satisfied while simultaneously minimizing an objective function. The optimal synthesis tool allows exploration of micromechanical design issues and objectives, as illustrated with a polysilicon lateral resonator example modeled in three mechanical degrees-of-freedom.
5834868825ff05a97b016d1c	A micromachined mirror to enhance the transverse scanning performance of endoscopic optical coherence tomography (EOCT) is presented. The scanning angle of the mirror can be up to 37/spl deg/. The EOCT can image an area to 4.2/spl times/2.8 mm/sup 2/at 5 frames/s. The results demonstrate its potential for in vivo imaging diagnosis.
5834868825ff05a97b016d22	A low-order behavioral squeeze film model of oscillating planar microstructures with critical dimensions in the range of a few microns is presented. Simulation results from this model are within 3% of those obtained from high-fidelity 3D numerical simulations using nontrivial boundary conditions. This low-order model has been added to the NODAS MEMS schematic library for system level design of MEMS. The results of system-level simulation of a CMOS micromechanical bandpass filter using this damping model are presented.
58cbc326c50f90cdd387981b	The input/otrtput (1/0) subsystem is often the bottleneck in high performance computer systems where the CPU/Memory technology has been pushed to the limit. But recent microprocessor and workstation speeds ae beginning to shift the system balance to the point that 1/0 is becoming the bottleneck even in mid-range and low-end systems. In this work the 1/0 subsystem's impact on system performartce is shown by modeling the relative performance of VAX uniprocessors with and without enhancement in the 1/0 subsystem.
58cbc341c50f90cdd387982e	Vuman is a wearable portable computer used for navigation through electronic blueprints. Thirty working units of Vuman were designed and manufactured from system concept using a concurrent engineering design environment. The authors describe the steps in prototyping Vuman, using the suite of synthesis and analysis tools in the electronic and mechanical domains which comprise the concurrent engineering design environment. Some unforeseen problems and their proposed solutions are discussed.
5834868825ff05a97b01756d	The most expensive phase of software development is testing, often consuming over half the budget of a software project. A study by NIST [1] has estimated that software defects cost $60 billion a year in the US economy alone. Unfortunately, test generation is a traditionally manual process.
5834868825ff05a97b01756e	Abstraction is the key to scaling model checking to industrial-sized problems. Typically, a large (or infinite) concrete system is approximated by a smaller abstract system via:(a) abstracting the concrete states,(b) analyzing the resulting abstract system, and (c) lifting the result back to the concrete system. Two common abstraction schemes are over-approximation–the abstract system contains more behaviours than the concrete one, and under-approximation–the abstract system contains less behaviours than the concrete one.
5834868825ff05a97b0163bd	Web site developers balance their need to collect information about users with their obligation to show respect for their users' privacy. The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project, or P3P, has emerged as a technology that may satisfy the wishes of both parties. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), P3P gives users more control over the amount of information they disclose about themselves as they browse the Web, and allows web sites to declare to browsers what sort of information they will request of users.
5834868825ff05a97b016c23	Novice Computer Science (CS) students struggle learning recursion for reasons such as unfamiliarity with recursive thinking and difﬁculty in visualizing program execution. Many tasks in CS require a thorough understanding of recursion. We introduce the recursion module of ChiQat-Tutor, an environment for learning CS algorithms and data structures. ChiQat-Tutor uses the pedagogical tool of Recursion Graphs to help students visualize, manipulate, and learn recursive processes.
5834868825ff05a97b017743	We present an active learning framework to simultaneously learn appearance and contextual models for scene understanding tasks (multi-class classification). Existing multi-class active learning approaches have focused on utilizing classification uncertainty of regions to select the most ambiguous region for labeling. These approaches, however, ignore the contextual interactions between different regions of the image and the fact that knowing the label for one region provides information about the labels of other regions.
5834868825ff05a97b016c24	Our CS Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), ChiQat-Tutor, aims at aiding students in overcoming the initial difficulties in CS education, such as learning data structures. Here, we show our work on utilizing Worked-out Examples (WOE) in our linked list lesson. Despite being a promising strategy, we find that it can be detrimental to student growth.
5834868825ff05a97b015e2a	The parameterized verification of concurrent algorithms and protocols has been addressed by a variety of recent methods. Experience shows that there is a trade-off between techniques which are widely applicable but depend on nontrivial human guidance, and fully automated approaches which are tailored for narrow classes of applications. In this spectrum, we propose a new framework based on environment abstraction which exhibits a large degree of automation and can be easily adjusted to different fields of application.
5834868825ff05a97b016c7b	We present the design of the Snackbot, a robot that will deliver snacks in our university buildings. The robot is intended to provide a useful, continuing service and to serve as a research platform for long-term Human-Robot Interaction. Our design process, which occurred over 24 months, is documented as a contribution for others in HRI who may be developing social robots that offer services. We describe the phases of the design project, and the design decisions and tradeoffs that led to the current version of the robot.
5834868825ff05a97b016c25	This paper explores the issue of what kind of evidence triggers changes in the teaching practice of Computer Science educators, and how educators evaluate the effectiveness of those changes. We interviewed 14 Computer Science instructors from three different institutions. Our study indicates that changes are mostly initiated from instructors' intuition, informal discussion with students, and anecdotal evidence.
5834868825ff05a97b016c28	We annotated and analyzed Worked Out Examples (WOEs) in a corpus of tutoring dialogues on Computer Science data structures. We found that some dialogue moves that occur within WOEs, or sequences thereof, correlate with learning. Features of WOEs such as length also correlate with learning for some data structures. These results will be used to augment the tutorial tactics available to iList, an ITS that helps student learn linked lists.
5834868825ff05a97b016c29	Based on our empirical studies of effective human tutoring, we developed an Intelligent Tutoring System, iList, that helps students learn linked lists, a challenging topic in Computer Science education. The iList system can provide several forms of feedback to students. Feedback is automatically generated thanks to a Procedural Knowledge Model extracted from the history of interaction of students with the system. This model allows iList to provide effective reactive and proactive procedural feedback while a student is solving a problem.
5834868825ff05a97b016d23	A CMOS chopper-stabilized amplifier with both DC and AC offset cancellation, for capacitive readout of motion in MEMS structures, achieves 40 nV//spl radic/HZ noise floor, 10 mV DC offset, and 40 dB sensor offset reduction. The amplifier, integrated into a CMOS-MEMS accelerometer, achieves 50/spl mu/g//spl radic/Hz noise floor.
5834868825ff05a97b016cc7	As the nature of virtual work changes, so must our understanding of important processes such as conflict. The present study examines conflict in ongoing virtual teams by situating itself in the context of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) development. A series of semi-structured interviews with diverse representatives of the FOSS community highlight differences in the way conflict occurs. Specifically, a transformation of conflict types is observed together with a form of conflict previously unidentified in work on virtual teams.
5834868825ff05a97b0164eb	We present a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and semantic dependencies. It learns a representation of the entire algorithm state, using stack long short-term memories. Our greedy inference algorithm has linear time, including feature extraction. On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that jointly learn syntax and semantics.
5834868825ff05a97b016c2a	In a tutoring system based on an exploratory environment, it is also important to provide direct guidance to students. We endowed iList, our linked list tutor, with the ability to generate proactive feedback using a procedural knowledge model automatically constructed from the interaction of previous students with the system. We compared the new version of iList with its predecessors and human tutors. Our evaluation shows that iList is effective in helping students learn.
5834868825ff05a97b016c2b	The focus of this study is positive feedback in one-on-one tutoring, its computational modeling, and its application to the design of more effective Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A data collection of tutoring sessions in the domain of basic Computer Science data structures has been carried out. A methodology based on multiple regression is proposed, and some preliminary results are presented. A prototype Intelligent Tutoring System on linked lists has been developed and deployed in a collegelevel Computer Science class.
5834868825ff05a97b016c81	MessyDesk is a replacement desktop that invites free-form decoration. MessyBoard is a large, projected, shared bulletin board that is decorated collaboratively by a small group of users. We built these programs with the goal of helping people remember more of the content that they access through a computer. Our approach is to embed content within distinct contexts. For instance, a computer with multiple projection screens could surround the user with panoramic vistas that correspond to projects that the user is working on.
58cac522c50f90cdd386e9e7	The fundamental premise behind Moving Target Defense (MTD) is to create a dynamic and shifting system that is more difficult to attack than a static system because a constantly changing attack surface at least reduces the chance of an attacker finding and exploiting the weakness. However, MTD approaches are typically chosen without regard to other qualities of the system, such as performance or cost. This report explores the use of self-adaptive systems, in particular those based on the architecture of the running system.
58cbb8c8c50f90cdd38790cd	The ISP (for Instruction Set Processor) notation was developed for a text [Bell& Newell, 1971] to precisely describe the programming level of a computer in terms of its Memory, Instruction Format, Data Types, Data Operations, Interpreting a Specific Instruction Set.
5834868825ff05a97b016c2c	We present a study of human tutorial dialogues in a core Computer Science domain that: focuses on individual tutoring sessions, rather than on contrasting different types of tutors; uses multiple regression analysis to correlate features of those sessions with learning outcomes; and highlights the effects of two types of tutor moves that have not been studied in depth so far, direct instruction and positive feedback.
5834868825ff05a97b016c2d	This paper presents a general architecture and four algorithms that use Natural Language Processing for automatic ontology matching. The proposed approach is purely instance based, ie, only the instance documents associated with the nodes of ontologies are taken into account. The four algorithms have been evaluated using real world test data, taken from the Google and LookSmart online directories. The results show that NLP techniques applied to instance documents help the system achieve higher performance.
5834868825ff05a97b016c30	To investigate whether more concise Natural Language feedback improves learning, we developed two Natural Language generators (DIAG-NLP1 and DIAG-NLP2), to provide feedback in an Intelligent Tutoring System that teaches troubleshooting. We systematically evaluated them in a three way comparison that included the original system, which generates overly repetitive feedback. We found that DIAG-NLP2, the generator which intuitively produces the best, corpus-based language, does engender the most learning.
58cac56fc50f90cdd386ea1d	Modern frameworks are required to be extendable as well as secure. However, these two qualities are often at odds. In this poster we describe an approach that uses a combination of static analysis and run-time management, based on software architecture models, that can improve security while maintaining framework extendability.
5834868825ff05a97b016c31	This paper presents a context sensitive spell checking system that uses mixed trigram models, and introduces a new empirically grounded method for building confusion sets. The proposed method has been implemented, tested, and evaluated in terms of coverage, precision, and recall. The results show that the method is effective.
5834868825ff05a97b016e23	It is our great pleasure to warmly welcome you to the 2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2013). WI 2013 is the 12th edition of its series.

5834868825ff05a97b016f3a	We study the threshold for the existence of a spanning maximal planar subgraph in the random graph G n, p. We show that it is very near p= 1/n ⅓ We also discuss the threshold for the existence of a spanning maximal outerplanar subgraph. This is very near p= 1/n ½.
5834868825ff05a97b016e30	We will demonstrate SconeEdit, a new tool for exploring and editing knowledge bases (KBs) that leverages interaction with domain texts. The tool provides an annotated view of user-selected text, allowing a user to see which concepts from the text are in the KB and to edit the KB directly from this Text View. Alongside the Text View, SconeEdit provides a navigable KB View of the knowledge base, centered on concepts that appear in the text. This unified tool gives the user a text-driven way to explore a KB and add new knowledge.
5834868825ff05a97b016f46	Informed prefetching provides a simple mechanism for I/O-intensive, cache-ineffective applications to efficiently exploit highly-parallel I/O subsystems such as disk arrays. This mechanism, dynamic disclosure of future accesses, yields substantial benefits over sequential readahead mechanisms found in current file systems for non-sequential workloads. This paper reports the performance of the Transparent Informed Prefetching system (TIP), a minimal prototype implemented in a Mach 3.0 system with up to four disks.

58cbb9f5c50f90cdd38791a6	Products of the future will be technologically more sophisticated, highly customized, produced in small batches, and brought to market quickly. These products will require an approach which integrates the application, the artifact, the CAD environment, and the physical prototyping. The EDRC is developing a comprehensive program to integrate these four activities.
5834868825ff05a97b016cd2	In this paper we describe an application of a lightly supervised Role Identification Model (RIM) to the analysis of coordination in Wikipedia talk page discussions. Our goal is to understand the substance of important coordination roles that predict quality of the Wikipedia pages where the discussions take place. Using the model as a lens, we present an analysis of four important coordination roles identified using the model, including Workers, Critiquers, Encouragers, and Managers.
5834868825ff05a97b016cd3	Through the lens of Expectancy Value Theory, we examine the effect of help giver badges, information about helper expertise, and up-and downvoting on help seeking in a MOOC discussion forum. Results show that badges alleviated the negative impact on help seeking introduced by up-and downvoting.
5834868825ff05a97b0164aa	The second Pervasive Health column presents a retrospective of the most recent International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (Pervasive Healthcare). The descriptions come from two perspectives: one from the technical program chair and one from an attendee and presenter.
5834868825ff05a97b016d42	Presents a new fabrication sequence for integrated-silicon microstructures designed and manufactured in a conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. The sequence employs a post-CMOS deep silicon backside etch, which allows fabrication of high aspect ratio (25: 1) and flat (greater than 10 mm radius of curvature) MEMS devices with integrated circuitry. A comb-drive resonator, a cantilever beam array and a z-axis accelerometer were fabricated using this process sequence.
5834868825ff05a97b016e41	The design of a microcoded instruction set for executing Common Lisp is presented. The influence that the language design, the machine, and the operating system had on this design is described. A statistical analysis of object code for an earlier instruction set was used to assign specific instruction lengths that led to a significant compression of the object code.
5834868825ff05a97b016f49	The clique cover number of a graph G is the minimum number of cliques required to cover the edges of graph G. In this paper we consider the random graph G (n, p), for p constant. We prove that with probability 1-o (1), the clique number of G (n, p) is Theta (n^ 2/\\log^ 2n).
5834868825ff05a97b016e50	This paper describes BUILD, a computer program which generates plans for building specified structures out of simple objects such as toy blocks. A powerful heuristic control structure enables BUILD to use a number of sophisticated construction techniques in its plans. Among these are the incorporation of pre-existing structure into the final design, pre-assembly of movable sub-structures on the table, and the use of extra blocks as temporary supports and counterweights in the course of the construction.
5834868825ff05a97b016e5b	Providing the first few letters of a missing word in a sentence gives information about this word. This paper attempts to measure the information transmitted in that case. In order to do so, we analyzed response accuracy for open cloze questions, that is fill-in-the-blank questions without multiple choice answers. In this study, native and non-native speakers of English answered a series of open cloze questions that were semi-automatically generated. Hints were provided that consisted of the first few letters of the missing word.
5834868825ff05a97b0172d5	The queue-read, queue-write (qrqw) parallel random access machine (pram) model permits concurrent reading and writing to shared memory locations, but at a cost proportional to the number of readers/writers to any one memory location in a given step. Theqrqw prammodel reflects the contention properties of most commercially available parallel machines more accurately than either the well-studiedcrcw pramorerew prammodels, and can be efficiently emulated with only logarithmic slowdown on hypercube-type noncombining networks.
5834868825ff05a97b017573	We present a general approach for verifying safety properties of Lustre programs automatically. Key aspects of the approach are the choice of an expressive first-order logic in which Lustre's semantics is modeled very naturally, the tailoring to this logic of SAT-based k-induction and abstraction techniques, and the use of SMT solvers to reason efficiently in this logic. We discuss initial experimental...
5834868825ff05a97b016cdd	In this paper, we propose an annotation schema for the discourse analysis of Wikipedia Talk pages aimed at the coordination efforts for article improvement. We apply the annotation schema to a corpus of 100 Talk pages from the Simple English Wikipedia and make the resulting dataset freely available for download. Furthermore, we perform automatic dialog act classification on Wikipedia discussions and achieve an average F 1-score of 0.82 with our classification pipeline.
5834868825ff05a97b016d44	This paper describes a CMOS capacitive sensing amplifier for a monolithic MEMS accelerometer fabricated by post-CMOS surface micromachining. This chopper stabilized amplifier employs capacitance matching with optimal transistor sizing to minimize sensor noise floor. Offsets due to sensor and circuit are reduced by ac offset calibration and dc offset cancellation based on a differential difference amplifier (DDA). Low-duty-cycle periodic reset is used to establish robust dc bias at the sensing electrodes with low noise.

5834868825ff05a97b0175d2	Abstract–We describe a new set of prismatic movement primitives for cubic modular robots. Our approach appears more practical than previous metamodule-based approaches. We also describe recent hardware developments in our cu-bic robot modules that have sufficient stiffness and actuator strength so that when they work together they can realize, in earth's gravity, all of the motion primitives we describe here.
5834868825ff05a97b0175d4	LDP (Locally Distributed Predicates) is a distributed, high-level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems (MRRs). In this paper we present the implementation of two motion-planning algorithms in LDP, and analyze both their performance and ease of implementation. We present multiple variations of one planner, including a novel resource allocation algorithm. We then draw conclusions about both the utility of the motion-planning algorithms and the suitability of LDP to the problem space.
5834868825ff05a97b0171d4	The present invention provides a prefetch system for use with a cache memory associated with a database employing indices. In one embodiment, the prefetch system includes a search subsystem configured to prefetch cache lines containing an index of a node of a tree structure associated with the database. Additionally, the prefetch system also includes a scan subsystem configured to prefetch cache lines based on an index prefetch distance between first and second leaf nodes of the tree structure.
58cbba21c50f90cdd38791c3	The daily life of a student involves a lot of collaborative activities with fellow students or faculty taking place in a variety of locations on the campus. We have implemented a number of location-aware applications to support the activities of mobile students workgroups. We describe the features of three of the most used applications, and we discuss some issues that we have encountered.
5834868825ff05a97b0171e0	Instruction-grain lifeguards monitor executing programs at the granularity of individual instructions to quickly detect bugs and security attacks, but their fine-grain nature incurs high monitoring overheads. This article identifies three common sources of these overheads and proposes three techniques that together constitute a general-purpose hardware acceleration framework for lifeguards.
5834868825ff05a97b0171e5	We consider the problem of estimating the number of distinct values in a data stream with repeated values. Distinct-values estimation was one of the first data stream problems studied: In the mid-1980's, Flajolet and Martin gave an effective algorithm that uses only logarithmic space. Recent work has built upon their technique, improving the accuracy guarantees on the estimation, proving lower bounds, and considering other settings such as sliding windows, distributed streams, and sensor networks.
5834868825ff05a97b0171e7	We study the following problem: given a strongly connected digraph, find a minimal strongly connected spanning subgraph of it. Our main result is a parallel algorithm for this problem, which runs in polylog parallel time and uses O (n 3) processors on a PRAM. Our algorithm is simple and the major tool it uses is computing a minimum-weight branching with zero-one weights. We also present sequential algorithms for the problem that run in time O (m+ n· log n).
5834868825ff05a97b016d4c	We are designing, implementing, and testing the user interface for RADAR (Reflective Agents with Distributed Adaptive Reasoning), which is a large multi-agent system that uses learning to help office workers cope with email overload and to complete routine tasks more efficiently. RADAR provides a mixed-initiative user interface in which artificial intelligence helps users perform the tasks that arrive in email messages. A large-scale user test of RADAR demonstrated the effectiveness of its user interface and AI.
5834868825ff05a97b016d51	A thumbnail of an original document has at least one appearance characteristic that is different from a corresponding appearance characteristic in an original document. When retrieving a document associated with the thumbnail, a document version is displayed that is more similar in appearance to the thumbnail than the original document. If desired, one or more further versions of the document, closer to or identical to the first version, may be subsequently displayed.
5834868825ff05a97b016d54	A thumbnail is generated by generating a thumbnail of an original document, generating at least one selectable element, and associating the at least one selectable element with the thumbnail in a display of the thumbnail. By selecting one of the selectable elements in the thumbnail, a document or document portion linked to the selectable element can be directly accessed.

Spoiler alert: there was a war between Roger Schank and Noam Chomsky, and Herb Simon won.

Seconds later, the screen fills with a 3D explosion, the result of unseen enemies hiding in physically accurate shadows. Disappointed, the user exits the game and returns to a computer desktop that exhibits the stylish 3D look-and-feel of a modern window manager. Both of these visual experiences require hundreds of gigaflops of computing performance, a demand met by the GPU (graphics processing unit) present in every consumer PC.

58cbba6ac50f90cdd38791f9	This paper demonstrates the feasibility of decoding neuronal population signals using a sparse linear regression model with an elastic net penalty. In offline analysis of real electrocorticographic (ECoG) neural data the elastic net achieved a timepoint decoding accuracy of 95% for classifying hand grasps vs. rest, and 82% for moving a cursor in 1-D space towards a target. These results were superior to those obtained using ℓ 2-penalized and unpenalized linear regression, and marginally better than ℓ 1-penalized regression.
5834868825ff05a97b0171ee	Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations outof-date.
5834868825ff05a97b0171f7	In this work we analyze fundamental properties of Random Apollonian Networks [34, 35], a popular random graph model which generates planar graphs with power law properties. Specifically, we analyze (a) the degree distribution,(b) the k largest degrees,(c) the k largest eigenvalues and (d) the diameter, where k is a constant.
5834868825ff05a97b0170dd	We are given n points distributed randomly in a compact region D of R m. We consider various optimisation problems associated with partitioning this set of points into k subsets. For each problem we demonstrate lower bounds which are satisfied with high probability. For the case where D is a hypercube we use a partitioning technique to give deterministic upper bounds and to construct algorithms which with high probability can be made arbitrarily accurate in polynomial time for a given required accuracy.
5834868825ff05a97b0170e3	Let the arc-lengths Li} of a complete digraph on n vertices be independent uniform [0, 1] random variables. We consider the patching algorithm of Karp and Steele for the travelling salesman problem on such a digraph and give modiﬁcations which tighten the expected error. We extend these ideas to the k-person travelling salesman problem and also consider the case where cities can be visited more than once.
58cbbb16c50f90cdd3879274	This report addresses the problem of ascertaining the quantitative properties of dependable distributed systems. The approach is based on fault injection experimentation with two distinct real-time workloads using a fault-injection-based automated testing environment. Experimental results are presented which indicate dependability properties (eg, error detection coverage, error latency) based on a limited number of fault injections.
5834868825ff05a97b0170e4	The problem of finding a perfect matching of small total length in a complete graph whose vertices are points in the interval 0, 1 is considered. The greedy heuristic for this problem repeatedly picks the two closest unmatched points x and y, and adds the edge xy to the matching. It is shown that if 2n points are randomly chosen uniformly in 0,1, then the expected length of the matching given by the greedy algorithm is θ(\\logn). This compares unfavourably with the length of the shortest perfect matching, which is always less than 1.
5834868825ff05a97b017200	We describe an algorithm which, given n= 2m points in the unit square, finds a matching of these points. We prove that, under the assumption that the points are uniformly distributed in the square, the algorithm has a fast expected running time, and it gives a matching with value close to the optimum with probability one as n tends to infinity.
58cbc5e0c50f90cdd3879a0a	This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a Companion Contextual Car Driver interface that proactively assists the driver in managing information and communication. The prototype combines a smart car environment and driver state monitoring, incorporating a wide range of input-output modalities and a display hierarchy. Intelligent agents link information from many contexts, such as location and schedule, and transparently learn from the driver, interacting with the driver only when it is necessary.

5834868825ff05a97b017354	Tuple-independent probabilistic databases (TI-PDBs) handle uncertainty by annotating each tuple with a probability parameter; when the user submits a query, the database derives the marginal probabilities of each output-tuple, assuming input-tuples are statistically independent. While query processing in TI-PDBs has been studied extensively, limited research has been dedicated to the problems of updating or deriving the parameters from observations of query results. Addressing this problem is the main focus of this paper.
58cbc651c50f90cdd3879a5a	In commercial literature, the meaning of the term fault tolerant has become vague. We describe a system used to measure the robustness of a fault tolerant aerospace system developed at IBM, present the data collected during the project, and report conclusions and areas for future work.
5834868825ff05a97b0175e4	We study coding schemes for multiparty interactive communication over synchronous networks that suffer from stochastic noise, where each bit is independently flipped with probability ε. We analyze the minimal overhead that must be added by the coding scheme in order to succeed in performing the computation despite the noise. Our main result is a lower bound on the communication of any noise-resilient protocol over a synchronous star network with n-parties (where all parties communicate in every round).

58cbc6a0c50f90cdd3879a91	An algorithm for extracting structure from a logical design is presented. It uses a data structure which explicitly represents not only connectivity, but also a variety of information that is generated during logical design. The algorithm is applied to a small design and used to determine the layout. Work is in progress to increase the number of functional cluster types that can be extracted and to develop additional heuristics for automatically mapping the structure onto the chip.
5834868825ff05a97b0164bd	This poster presents the homeset algorithm, a lightweight approach to estimate occupancy schedules of private households. The algorithm relies on the mobile phones of households' occupants to collect Wi-Fi scans. The scans are then used to determine if occupants are at home or not. The algorithm operates in an autonomous fashion using only information available locally on the mobile phones. We validate our approach using a data set from the Nokia Lausanne Data Collection Campaign.

We show projections of words related to the concept “good” vs.“bad” and “man” vs.“woman” in Figure 1.
58c918a6c50f90cdd385d879	A major challenge in the analysis of structured human data—including natural language but also sources like music, historical documents, and other complex artifacts—is the presence of hidden structure between the input and almost anything you want to predict. Suppose you want a system to translate an English sentence into Chinese. The system will need to know something about the syntactic correspondence between these two languages. For example, in English, prepositional phrases follow verb phrases, but in Chinese, they precede them.
5834868825ff05a97b017201	We consider a natural parallel version of the classical greedy algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a graph. This version was studied in Coppersmith, Raghavan, and Tompa and they conjecture there that its expected running time on random graphs of arbitrary edge density of O (log n). We prove that conjecture.
5834868825ff05a97b0170e6	Let G be a graph on vertex set [n], and for X⊆[n] let N (X) be the union of X and its neighbourhood in G. A family of sets [Fscr]⊆ 2 [n] is G-intersecting if N (X)∩ Y≠[empty] for all X, Y∈[Fscr]. In this paper we study the cardinality and structure of the largest k-uniform G-intersecting families on a fixed graph G.
5834868825ff05a97b0170e7	Let graph $ G=(V, E) $ and integer $ b\\geq 1$ be given. A set $ S\\subseteq V $ is said to be $ b $-independent if $ u, v\\in S $ implies $ d_G (u, v)> b $, where $ d_G (u, v) $ is the shortest distance between $ u $ and $ v $ in $ G $. The $ b $-independence number $\\a_b (G) $ is the size of the largest $ b $-independent subset of $ G $. When $ b= 1$ this reduces to the standard definition of independence number.
5834868825ff05a97b017204	Let Gn, m, k denote the space of simple graphs with n vertices, m edges and minimum degree at least k, each graph G being equiprobable. Let G have property Ak if G contains⌊(k− 1)/2⌋ edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, and, if k is even, a further edge disjoint matching of size⌊ n/2⌋. For k≥ 3, Ak occurs in Gn, m, k with probability tending to 1 as n→∞, when 2m≥ ckn for some suitable constant ck.
5834868825ff05a97b017208	We consider the performance of a simple greedy matching algorithm MINGREEDY when applied to random cubic graphs. We show that if λ n is the expected number of vertices not matched by MINGREEDY, there are positive constants c 1 and c 2 such that C 1 n 1/5≤ λ n≤ C 2 n 1/5 log n.
5834868825ff05a97b0170f0	The strong chromatic index of a graph G, denoted by \\chi_s(G), is the minimum number of colors needed to color its edges so that each color class is an induced matching. In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behavior of this parameter in a random graph G(n,p), for two regions of the edge probability p=p(n). For the dense case, where p is a constant, 0<p<1, we prove that with high probability \\chi_s(G)≤(1+o(1))34n^2p\\log_bn, where b=1/(1-p). This improves upon a result of Czygrinow and Nagle\\it Discrete Math., 281 (2004), pp.
5834868825ff05a97b017772	This project represents a first step towards bridging the gap between HCI and cognition research. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we introduce tech-niques to non-invasively measure a range of cognitive workload states that have implications to HCI research, most directly usability testing. We present a set of usability experiments that illustrates how fNIRS brain measurement provides information about the cognitive demands placed on computer users by different interface designs.
58cbbbddc50f90cdd3879300	Our study focuses on finding new input devices for a system allowing users with any skill to configure and conduct a virtual orchestra in real-time. As a first step, we conducted a user study to learn more about the interaction between a conductor's gestures and the orchestra's reaction. During an orchestra rehearsal session, we observed a conductor's timing and gestures using the eWatch, a wrist-worn wearable computer and sensor platform. The gestures are analyzed and compared to the music of the orchestra.
5834868825ff05a97b0170f4	In this work, we analyze fundamental properties of random Apollonian networks [Zhang et al. 06, Zhou et al. 05], a popular random graph model that generates planar graphs with power-law properties. Specifically, we analyze the degree distribution, the k largest degrees, the k largest eigenvalues, and the diameter, where k is a constant.
5834868825ff05a97b0170f5	We consider the problem of k-colouring a random r-uniform hypergraph with n vertices and cn edges, where k, r, c remain constant as n→∞ n→∞. Achlioptas and Naor showed that the chromatic number of a random graph in this setting, the case r= 2 r= 2, must have one of two easily computable values as n→∞ n→∞. We give a complete generalisation of this result to random uniform hypergraphs.
5834868825ff05a97b0170f7	We show that there is a function α (r) such that for each constant r≧ 3, almost every r-regular graph on n vertices has a hole (vertex induced cycle) of size at least α (r) n as n→∞. We also show that there is a function β (c) such that for c> 0 large enough, G n, p, p= c/n almost surely has a hole of size at least β (c) n as n→∞.
5834868825ff05a97b015e48	Establishing the correctness of complicated asynchronous circuit is in general quite difficult because of the high degree of nondeterminism that is inherent in such devices. Nevertheless, it is also very important in view of the cost involved in design and testing of circuits. We show how to give specifications for circuits in a branching time temporal logic and how to mechanically verify them using a simple and efficient model checker. We also show how to tackle a large and complex circuit by verifying it hierarchically.
5834868825ff05a97b01720b	Consider a connected r-regular n-vertex graph G with random independent edge lengths, each uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Let mst (G) be the expected length of a minimum spanning tree. We show in this paper that if G is sufficiently highly edge connected then the expected length of a minimum spanning tree is∼ nr ζ (3). If we omit the edge connectivity condition, then it is at most∼ nr (ζ (3)+ 1).
5834868825ff05a97b0170fa	Let the edges of a graph G be coloured so that no colour is used more than k times. We refer to this as a k-bounded colouring. We say that a subset of the edges of G is multicoloured if each edge is of a different colour. We say that the colouring is H-good, if a multicoloured Hamilton cycle exists ie, one with a multicoloured edge-set. Let ARk={G: every k-bounded colouring of G is H-good}. We establish the threshold for the random graph Gn, m to be in ARk.
5834868825ff05a97b0170fc	We study the average-case complexity of shortest paths problems in the vertex-potential model. The vertex-potential model is a family of probability distributions on complete directed graphs with arbitrary real edge lengths but without negative cycles. We show that on a graph with n vertices and with respect to this model, the single-source shortest-paths problem can be solved in O (n 2) expected time, and the all-pairs shortest-paths problem can be solved in O (n 2 log n) expected time.
5834868825ff05a97b017105	We consider the size of the largest induced tree in random graphs, random regular graphs and random regular digraphs where the average degree is constant. In all cases we show that with probability 1− o (1), such graphs have induced trees of size order n. In particular, the first result confirms a conjecture of Erdos and Palka (Discrete Math. 46 (1983), 145–150).
5834868825ff05a97b017217	We do a probabilistic analysis of the problem of distributing a single piece of information to the vertices of a graph G. Assuming that the input graph G is G n, p, we prove an O (ln n/n) upper bound on the edge density needed so that with high probability the information can be broadcast in⌈ log 2 n⌉ rounds.
5834868825ff05a97b017106	We give a simple proof of the result of Bollobás and Simon (1985) on the linear expected time \nconstruction of a binary heap. We also give bounds on the probability that the construction time \nis much more than this and generalise the result to d-heaps, d ≥ 2.   Cookies are used by this \nsite.

5834868825ff05a97b01710a	A hypergraph is simple if every two edges share at most one vertex. It is trianglefree if in addition every three pairwise intersecting edges have a vertex in common. We prove that there is an absolute constant c such that the chromatic number of a simple triangle-free triple system with maximum degree∆ is at most c√∆/log∆. This extends a result of Johansson about graphs, and is sharp apart from the constant c.
5834868825ff05a97b01721c	The random simplex algorithm for linear programming proceeds as follows: at each step, it moves from a vertex v of the polytope to a randomly chosen neighbor of v, the random choice being made from those neighbors of v that improve the objective function. We exhibit a polytope defined by n constraints in three dimensions with height O (logn), for which the expected running time of the random simplex algorithm is Ω (n log n).
5834868825ff05a97b01710c	For each k≥ 2, let ρ k∈(0, 1) be the largest number such that there exist k-uniform hypergraphs on n vertices with independent neighborhoods and (ρ k+ o (1))(kn) edges as n→∞. We prove that ρ k= 1− 2logk/k+ Θ (log log k/k) as k→∞. This disproves a conjecture of Füredi and the last two authors.
5834868825ff05a97b01710d	We call a coloring of the edge set of a graph G a b-bounded coloring if no color is used more than b times. We say that a subset of the edges of G is rainbow if each edge is of a different color. A graph has property A (b, H) if every b-bounded coloring of its edges has a rainbow copy of H. We estimate the threshold for the random graph Gn, p to have property A (b, H).
5834868825ff05a97b01721e	We analyse thegeneralised assignment problem under the assumption that all coefficients are drawn uniformly and independently from [0, 1]. We show that such problems can be solved exactly with high probability, in a well-defined sense. The results are closely related to earlier work of Lueker, Goldberg and Marchetti-Spaccamela and ourselves.
5834868825ff05a97b01710e	Let G be a finite graph with minimum degree r. Form a random subgraph G p of G by taking each edge of G into G p independently and with probability p. We prove that for any constant ε> 0, if $ p=\\frac {1+\\epsilon}{r} $, then G p is non-planar with probability approaching 1 as r grows. This generalizes classical results on planarity of binomial random graphs.
5834868825ff05a97b017110	In particular the algebraic assignment problem was introduced in Burkard et al.[2]. In that paper an 0 (m4) algorithm was given for its solution. In Burkard and Zimmermann [4] an 0 (n3) algorithm was constructed which is a generalisation of an algorithm of Tomizawa [lo] for the classic assignment problem. This paper gives an O (n3) algorithm which is based on the algorithm of Dinic and Kronrod [7].
5834868825ff05a97b017221	The innovation of parallel computers has added a new dimension to the design of algorithms. Parallel programming is not a simple extension of serial programming. We describe parallel algorithms for the quadratic assignment problem and present our computational experience using the massively parallel processor, DAP. We further report the speedup obtained by parallelising algorithms for solving the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional assignment problems on the DAP.
5834868825ff05a97b017111	Let p n denote the proportion of n-vertex graphs in class 2, that is, such that the chromatic index \nexceeds the maximum vertex degree. We extend a result of Erdős and Wilson, and show that \nn−(12 + ε)n < pn < n−(18 − ε)n for n sufficiently large.   Cookies are used by this site. For more \ninformation, visit the cookies page.
5834868825ff05a97b017112	Model 1. Consider the complete graph K n, with vertex set [n]={1, 2,…, n}, in which each edge e is assigned a length X e. Colour the k shortest edges incident with each vertex green and the remaining edges blue. The graph made up of the green edges only, will be referred to as the k-th nearest neighbour graph. This graph has been studied in a variety of contexts both computational and statistical.
5834868825ff05a97b01711a	The central observation of this paper is that if εn random arcs are added to any n-node strongly connected digraph with bounded degree then the resulting graph has diameter  (lnn) with high probability. We apply this to smoothed analysis of algorithms and property testing.

5834868825ff05a97b01711f	This paper considers the problem of finding paths from a fixed node to all other nodes of a directed graph which minimise a function defined on the paths. Under certain assumptions a characterisation of optimal paths is derived. Two algorithms which are generalisations of standard shortest path methods are then given.
5834868825ff05a97b017360	Information on the Web is not only abundant but also redundant. This redundancy of information has an important consequence on the relation between the recall of an information gathering system and its capacity to harvest the core information of a certain domain of knowledge. This paper provides a new idea for estimating the necessary Web coverage of a knowledge acquisition system in order to achieve a certain desired coverage of the contained core information.
5834868825ff05a97b017361	In this paper, we propose causality as a unified framework to explain query answers and non-answers, thus generalizing and extending several previously proposed approaches of provenance and missing query result explanations. We develop our framework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl [13]. After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition, we propose functional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties.
5834868825ff05a97b017362	This paper develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Boolean expressions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning them new individual probabilities. Our technique generalizes and extends the underlying idea of a number of recent approaches which are varyingly called node splitting, variable renaming, variable splitting, or dissociation for probabilistic databases. We prove that the probabilities we assign to new variables are the best possible in some sense.
5834868825ff05a97b0175f3	This paper initiates the study of self-adjusting distributed data structures or networks. In particular, we present SplayNets: a binary search tree based network that is self-adjusting to the routing requests. We derive entropy bounds on the amortized routing cost and show that our splaying algorithm has some interesting properties.
5834868825ff05a97b0175fc	We give a linear-time algorithm to find a feasible flow in a strongly connected network with fixed supplies and demands, each summing to a common value that is at most the minimum arc capacity. This algorithm speeds up the Goldberg–Rao maximum flow method by a constant factor.
5834868825ff05a97b017120	Let a random graph G be constructed by adding random edges one by one, starting with n isolated vertices. We show that with probability going to one as n goes to infinity, when G first has minimum degree two, it has at least (log n) math image distinct hamilton cycles for any fixed ϵ> 0.
5834868825ff05a97b017796	This short paper introduces the Interaction Predicate model, which attempts to model some aspects of systematic interpretation of codified law. It introduces an intermediate rule representation containing dynamic reasoning elements which make use of domain knowledge ontologies.

The display contains inspection instructions and status options logically connected in a circular list. The dial is used to highlight the desired option, which is selected by using a button.
5834868825ff05a97b017230	We analyse the multi-constraint zero-one knapsack problem, under the assumption that all coefficients are drawn from a uniform [0, 1] distribution and there are m= 0 (1) constraints as the number of variables grows. We show that results on the single-constraint problem can be extended to this situation. Chiefly, we generalise a result of Lueker on the duality gap, and a result of Goldberg/Marchetti-Spaccamela on exact solvability. In the latter case, our methods differ markedly from those for the single-constraint result.
5834868825ff05a97b017127	In this paper we establish the cover time of a random graph G (d) chosen uniformly at random from the set of graphs with vertex set [n] and degree sequence d. We show that under certain restrictions on d, the cover time of G (d) is whp asymptotic to d− 1d− 2θdnlogn. Here θ is the average degree and d is the effective minimum degree.
5834868825ff05a97b017233	Let G=(V, E) be an r-regular expander graph. Certain algorithms for finding edge disjoint paths require that its edges be partitioned into E= E1∪ E2∪···∪ Ek so that the graphs Gi=(V, Ei) are each expanders. In this paper we give a nonconstructive proof of the existence a very good split plus an algorithm for finding a partition better than that given in AZ Broder, AM Frieze, and E. Upfal (SIAM J. Comput. 23 (1994), 976–989).
5834868825ff05a97b01712a	We describe a new integer programming formulation for the permutation flowshop problem in which the objective is to minimise the makespan. This formulation can have an exponential number of constraints, but its linear programming relaxation can be solved by a novel (row generation) algorithm in polynomial time. We present some computational experience.
5834868825ff05a97b017236	Christofides heuristic is extended to the problem of finding a minimum length k-person tour of a complete graph using lengths that satisfy the triangular inequality. An approachable upper bound of 32 is demonstrated for the ratio of heuristic to optimum length solutions.
5834868825ff05a97b01712d	We define a space of random edge-coloured graphs [Gscr] n, m, κ which correspond naturally to edge κ-colourings of G n, m. We show that there exist constants K 0, K 1 [les] 21 such that, provided m [ges] K 0 n log n and κ [ges] K 1 n, then a random edge-coloured graph contains a multi-coloured Hamilton cycle with probability tending to 1 as the number of vertices n tends to infinity.
5834868825ff05a97b017237	An O (log n) time, n processor randomized algorithm for computing the k-nearest neighbor graph of n points in d dimensions, for fixed d and k is presented. The method is based on the use of sphere separators. Probability bounds are proved using the moment generating function technique.
5834868825ff05a97b01779d	This paper presents a technique with which instances of argument structures in the Carneades model can be given a probabilistic semantics by translating them into Bayesian networks. The propagation of argument applicability and statement acceptability can be expressed through conditional probability tables. This translation suggests a way to extend Carneades to improve its utility for decision support in the presence of uncertainty.

5834868825ff05a97b017305	Webcams, microphones, pressure gauges and other sensors provide exciting new opportunities for querying and monitoring the physical world. In this paper we focus on querying wide area sensor databases, containing (XML) data derived from sensors spread over tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATH queries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a single XML document, while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes.
58cd4800c50f90cdd3887903	A motor includes an armature, a coil, and a magnetic support structure. The motor also includes at least one magnet that defines a space. The coil forms a tunnel. The space is defined by the at least one magnet being aligned with the tunnel formed by the coil. Portions of the armature extend through the space and the tunnel. An opening at an end of the coil is shaped so as to restrict movement of the armature.
5834868825ff05a97b015ebe	The timing of switching pauses is critical to mother-infant synchrony. The relation between switching-pause duration and maternal depression was studied in 15 depressed and 20 nondepressed mother-infant dyads. Switching pauses of depressed mothers were longer, more variable, and less consistent with scalar timing.
5834868825ff05a97b017496	Since MT systems, whatever translation method they employ, do not reach an optimum output on free text; each method handles some problems better than others. The PANGLOSS Mark III system is an MT environment that uses the best results from a variety of independent MT systems or engines working simultaneously within a single framework on the same text. This paper describes the method used to combine the outputs of the engines into a single text.
5834868825ff05a97b017ab1	The sustainability of scientific software is a key challenge for science policy. We approach this question by drawing on empirical studies of scientists using software and describe how components are arranged with complements and dependencies into value-‐providing assemblies, periodically revisited by their scientist users. Over time, software declines in scientific usefulness, driven by four factors: a moving scientific frontier and technological change, production friction, use friction and the software ecosystem context.
58cbcff6c50f90cdd387a12c	This paper illustrates the methodology of the CMU Design Automation System by presenting an automated design of the PDP-8/E data paths from a functional description. This automated design (using synthesis techniques) is compared both to DEC's implementation and the intersil single chip implementation.
5834868825ff05a97b017ab3	3.1 PURPOSE The purpose of the IRAD was twofold: first to establish that there is a source of risk in the misalignment between organization structure and processes and the architectural decisions that have been made. Secondly, the purpose was to identify and verify low-cost indicators that can be used to identify the occurrences of this misalignment.
5834868825ff05a97b01773c	What primitives should we use to infer the rich 3D world behind an image? We argue that these primitives should be both visually discriminative and geometrically informative and we present a technique for discovering such primitives. We demonstrate the utility of our primitives by using them to infer 3D surface normals given a single image. Our technique substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art and shows improved cross-dataset performance.
5834868825ff05a97b017893	This paper reports progress in range itnage analysis for autonomous navigation in outdoor environments. The goal of ow work is to use range data from an ENhi laser range finder to build a three-dimensional description of the environment. We describe techniques for building both low-level description, such as obsfacle maps or terrain maps, av well as higher level description using model-bared object recognition. We have integrated these techniques in the NAW qstm [IO].
58cd8fd4c50f90cdd3889dea	This Letter addresses the problem of dynamic power allocation based on spectrum sensing outputs for non-ergodic systems. On such type of systems, the power allocation for each corresponding nodes to be sensed by cognitive transmitter may not require all the time. The dynamic power allocation in nodes of each channel in cognitive radio (CR) network using vector quantization based on autocorrelation error is proposed.
5834868825ff05a97b017b01	LADAR measurements to detect and track pedestrians over time. The algorithm can process range measurements from both line and 3D scanners. The use of line scanners allows detection and tracking at rates up to 75 Hz. However, this type of sensor may not always perform satisfactorily in uneven terrains. A 3D LADAR is used to improve operation in uneven terrains, by first estimating the local ground elevation, and then performing the detection using the measurements corresponding to a certain height above the ground.
58cad1bcc50f90cdd386f2cf	Traditional mechanisms that allow a system to detect and recover from errors are typically wired into applications at the level of code where they are hard to change, reuse, or analyze. An alternative approach is to use externalized adaptation: one or more models of a system are maintained at run time and external to the application as a basis for identifying problems and resolving them. In this paper we provide an overview of recent research in which we use architectural models as the basis for such problem diagnosis and repair.
5834868825ff05a97b017773	We discuss the physiological metrics that can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs). We address the functional and practical limitations of each device, and technical issues to be mindful of when combining the devices. We also present machine learning methods that can be used on concurrent recordings of EEG and fNIRs data. We discuss an experiment that combines fNIRs and EEG to measure a range of user states that are of interest in HCI.
5834868825ff05a97b017bc6	Developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) explain how regulatory states are established in particular cells during development and how these states then determine the final form of the embryo. Evolutionary changes to the sequence of the genome will direct reorganization of GRN architectures, which in turn will lead to the alteration of developmental programs. A comparison of GRN architectures must consequently reveal the molecular basis for the evolution of developmental programs among different organisms.
5834868825ff05a97b015ed4	Of all the nonverbal behaviors—body movements, posture, gaze, proxemics, voice—the face is probably the most commanding and complicated, and perhaps the most confusing. In part, the face is commanding because it is always visible, always providing some information. There is no facial equivalent to the concealment maneuver of putting one's hands in one's pockets. Whereas sounds and the body movements that illustrate speech are intermittent, the face, even in repose, may provide information about some emotion or mood state.
58cdbddac50f90cdd388b5b9	This work explores the capability of bi-directional manipulation during assistance to blind or low vision users. We describe a haptic approach that utilizes the manipulator arm to support interaction and provide navigational information supplemented with landmarks and spatial cues to users.
5834868825ff05a97b017bdd	Linguistic labels such as high, medium, and low are commonly used in different applications. Researchers in psychometrics argue that before adding new labels to applications, the labels must be empirically evaluated. In this paper, we explain the process of selecting labels for a security assessment application. We also show how we evaluate the labels empirically using a sample population from Amazon Mechanical Turk users.
58cbd185c50f90cdd387a246	In this paper some measures are presented that characterize both the performance and reliability of digital computing systems in time sharing environments from a user viewpoint. The measures (Apparent Capacity and Expected Elapsed Time required to correctly execute a given program) are based on a mathematical model built upon traditional assumptions. The model is a hybrid in that is uses statistics gathered from a real system while giving analytical expressions for other statistics such as the Expected Elapsed time.
58cdcf27c50f90cdd388bea4	The recent intense interest in algorithms that rely on SDD solvers was motivated by the seminal work of Spielman and Teng who gave the first nearly-linear time algorithm for such systems, running in time O (m logc m log (1/ϵ)), where m is the number of non-zero elements in the system matrix, ϵ is the approximation error, and c is some large constant [4]. The Spielman and Teng solver is a very complicated and impractical algorithm.
5834868825ff05a97b01724a	We study the problem of finding a large planted clique in the random graph $ G_ {n, 1/2} $. We reduce the problem to that of maximising a three dimensional tensor over the unit ball in $ n $ dimensions. This latter problem has not been well studied and so we hope that this reduction will eventually lead to an improved solution to the planted clique problem.
5834868825ff05a97b01779e	This paper explains and illustrates in an example context how case comparison in legal case-based reasoning can be modeled in the value judgment formalism. It presents a set of argument schemes corresponding to typical moves in case-based reasoning which make use of intermediate legal concepts and their impact on the applicable values.
5834868825ff05a97b017142	When astronomers analyze sky images, they need to identify the newly observed celestial objects in the catalog of known objects. We have developed a technique for indexing catalogs, which supports fast retrieval of closely matching catalog objects for every object in new images. It allows processing of a sky image in less than a second, and it scales to catalogs with billions of objects.

In this technical report, we describe the RAID concept, the basic RAID levels, a more detailed analysis of RAID performance on reliability, and our initial prototyping plans.
5834868825ff05a97b0177a3	In Sorani Kurdish, one of the most useful orthographic features in named-entity recognition–capitalization–is absent, as the language's Perso-Arabic script does not make a distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. We describe a system for deriving an inferred capitalization value from closely related languages by phonological similarity, and illustrate the system using several related Western Iranian languages.
5834868825ff05a97b015e64	The system has three main elements:(1) powerful off-board motor and controller,(2) a tether transmitting mechanical power and sensor signals,(3) a lightweight instrumented end-effector worn by the participant (Fig. S1). This division of components maximizes responsiveness and minimizes endeffector mass during treadmill walking. A powerful, low-inertia electric motor and a high-speed, real-time controller provide off-board actuation. Motor voltage is regulated using an industrial motor drive with embedded velocity control.
5834868825ff05a97b01740e	Revelations over the past couple of years highlight the importance of understanding malicious and surreptitious weakening of cryptographic systems. We provide an overview of this domain, using a number of historical examples to drive development of a weaknesses taxonomy. This allows comparing different approaches to sabotage. We categorize a broader set of potential avenues for weakening systems using this taxonomy, and discuss what future research is needed to provide sabotage-resilient cryptography.
5834868825ff05a97b01727c	Data-intensive distributed file systems are emerging as a key component of large scale Internet services and cloud computing platforms. They are designed from the ground up and are tuned for specific application workloads. Leading examples, such as the Google File System, Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and Amazon S3, are defining this new purpose-built paradigm. It is tempting to classify file systems for large clusters into two disjoint categories, those for Internet services and those for high performance computing.
5834868825ff05a97b01727e	There is an increasing use of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters with thousands of compute nodes that, with the advent of multi-core CPUs, will impose a significant challenge for storage systems: The ability to scale to handle I/O generated by applications executing in parallel in tens of thousands of threads. One such challenge is building scalable directories for cluster storage-ie, directories that can store billions to trillions of entries and handle hundreds of thousands of operations per second.
5834868825ff05a97b0174c8	was then further improved to 67k [7]. Moreover, the results can be extended to graphs of bounded genus [10]. In addition, similar results (linear kernelization) have been recently obtained for the FULL-DEGREE SPANNING TREE problem in planar graphs [13]. Very recently, these results have been generalized into a methodological framework [12].
5834868825ff05a97b017281	TCP Incast plagues scalable cluster-based storage built atop standard TCP/IP-over-Ethernet, often resulting in much lower client read bandwidth than can be provided by the available network links. This paper reviews the Incast problem and discusses potential application-level approaches to avoiding it.
5834868825ff05a97b017285	Component failure in large-scale IT installations is becoming an ever-larger problem as the number of components in a single cluster approaches a million. This article is an extension of our previous study on disk failures [Schroeder and Gibson 2007] and presents and analyzes field-gathered disk replacement data from a number of large production systems, including high-performance computing sites and internet services sites. More than 110,000 disks are covered by this data, some for an entire lifetime of five years.
5834868825ff05a97b017289	Informed prefetching provides a simple mechanism for I/O-intensive, cache-ineffective applications to efficiently exploit highly-parallel I/O subsystems such as disk arrays. This mechanism, dynamic disclosure of future accesses, yields substantial benefits over sequential readahead mechanisms found in current file systems for non-sequential workloads. This paper reports the performance of the Transparent Informed Prefetching system (TIP), a minimal prototype implemented in a Mach 3.0 system with up to four disks.
58cbc1a3c50f90cdd3879705	Portable computers including laptops, notebooks, sub-notebooks and portable digital assistants are a rapidly growing segment of the computer market. Manufacturers of portable computers have an opportunity to win public praise and to avoid censure and liability by embracing green design and sensible product disposal systems. This paper analyzes the environmental issues associated with disposal, re-use and recycling of these machines, focusing on potential design changes to alleviate environmental burdens.
5834868825ff05a97b0174d6	I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science. Specific areas of interest include the theory of error-correcting codes and its applications, approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation, probabilistically checkable proofs, explicit combinatorial constructions, the theory of pseudorandomness, computational and communication complexity, streaming and sub-linear computation, and algebraic algorithms.
5834868825ff05a97b017bfa	Despite the remarkable success of open source software, there are a number of challenges to collaboration in open source software development, in particular, with respect to supporting collaboration among developers, supporting potential contributors, and in bringing users and developers together. In this paper, we examine some of the possible enhancements of open source development environments, and consider the application of Semantic Web technology to address these.
5834868825ff05a97b017c10	Commercially, many in the industry are using products based on Open Source. What have been missing are studies on if the commercial industry benefits from developing software following the open source development model. We present a case study that examines this issue by applying the concepts of the open source software development methodology to creating industrial-strength software. We conclude with lessons learned and open research questions.
5834868825ff05a97b0177ce	A major obstacle to successful high-level synthesis (HLS) of large-scale application-specified integrated circuit systems is the presence of memory accesses to a shared-memory subsystem. The latency to access memory is often not statically predictable, which creates problems for scheduling operations dependent on memory reads. More fundamental is that dependences between accesses may not be statically provable (eg, if the specification language permits pointers), which introduces memory-consistency problems.
5834868825ff05a97b017510	We have surveyed the topic of list decoding with a focus on the recent advances in decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes and close variants, culminating with a presentation of how to achieve the list decoding capacity over large alphabets. We conclude by mentioning some interesting open questions and directions for future work.
5834868825ff05a97b01729d	ABSTRACT: Disk arrays provide the promise of greatly increased transfer bandwidth at low cost. But without additional data redundancy, an array can suffer from signiﬁcantly degraded reliability. In this paper we more closely examine the reliability of RAID systems and ﬁnd that although phenomenal reliability disk arrays can not be attained with data redundancy alone, RAID system reliability can be made better than conventional large disks with little extra hardware.
5834868825ff05a97b0164f8	We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training instances.

It appears that the optimal value of push-off work is greater than the range tested here and several times greater than the values targeted in current robotic prostheses, even when accounting for the implied costs of motors and batteries.
58cdedfcc50f90cdd388cf04	The paper presents an anaphora resolution algorithm for unrestricted text. In particular, we examine portability of a knowledge-based approach of (Mitamura et al., 2002), proposed for a domain-specific task. We obtain up to 70% accuracy on unrestricted text, which is a significant improvement (almost 20%) over a baseline we set for general text. As the overall results leave much room for improvement, we provide a detailed error analysis and investigate possible enhancements.
58cbd6f2c50f90cdd387a620	This paper describes the architecture of a new large multi-processor computer system being built at Carnegie-Mellon University. The system allows close cooperation between large numbers of inexpensive processors. All processors share access to a single virtual memory address space. There are no arbitrary limits on the number of processors, amount of memory or communication bandwidth in the system. Considerable support is provided for low level operating system primitives and inter-process communication.

5834868825ff05a97b0177e0	A major impediment to understanding programmable matter is the lack of an existing system with sufficiently many modules of sufficient capabilities. In this paper we describe the requirements of physically distributed ensembles and discuss the use of the distributed programming language Meld to program ensembles of these units. We demonstrate a new system designed to meet these requirements called Blinky Blocks and discuss the hardware design we used to create 100 of these modules.

58cdee4ac50f90cdd388cf31	We study the perturbation of a positive matrix A to a positive matrix B, in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of the pair (A, B). We give an estimate for the relative change in the eigenvalues, as well as bounds on the angles between the perturbed and unperturbed eigenvectors. This class includes componentwise, or more generally'localized', relative perturbations of Laplacians. We show that the estimate is optimal up to a constant, even for the class of Laplacians.
5834868825ff05a97b015eed	Pain is typically assessed by patient self-report. Self-reported pain, however, is difficult to interpret and may be impaired or in some circumstances (ie, young children and the severely ill) not even possible. To circumvent these problems behavioral scientists have identified reliable and valid facial indicators of pain. Hitherto, these methods have required manual measurement by highly skilled human observers. In this paper we explore an approach for automatically recognizing acute pain without the need for human observers.
5834868825ff05a97b0177cc	Chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN) is a promising alternative to CMOS for constructing circuits with feature sizes in the tens of nanometers range. In this paper we describe some of the recent advances in CAEN and how they influence the design of digital circuits. We show how reconfigurability supports inexpensive manufacturing. Finally, we describe a molecular latch that overcomes the lack of a viable CAEN-based transistor.
58cbc76ec50f90cdd3879b23	We have developed an integrated driving-aware system that allows us to effectively conduct driving user experience (UX) studies. Our system senses driver and vehicle status, analyzes the collected data, and makes a decision about what feedback to provide a driver in a single Android application. We also propose a graphical experimental authoring tool to plan driving routes and manage UX experimental factors. This research with real-world experiments should have great positive impact on further driving-related UX studies.
5834868825ff05a97b01760b	We design and analyze gossip algorithms for networks with correlated data. In these networks, either the data to be distributed, the data already available at the nodes, or both, are correlated. Although coding schemes for correlated data have been studied extensively, the focus has been on characterizing the rate region in static memory-free networks. In a gossip-based scheme, however, nodes communicate among each other by continuously exchanging packets according to some underlying communication model.
5834868825ff05a97b01737f	In this paper, we propose causality as a unified framework to explain query answers and non-answers, thus generalizing and extending several previously proposed approaches of provenance and missing query result explanations. We develop our framework starting from the well-studied definition of actual causes by Halpern and Pearl. After identifying some undesirable characteristics of the original definition, we propose functional causes as a refined definition of causality with several desirable properties.
58cdfcd9c50f90cdd388d72f	Abstract—We detail an approach for translating storyboarding, a common method of spatial and temporal motion design used by choreographers and theatric directors, into dynamically feasible trajectories for multiple aerial vehicles for use in theatric performances. We show flight results for motions designed for groups of four, six, and eight quadrotors, and discuss design considerations for extending the implementation to more complex choreographies.
58cbf532c50f90cdd387bac9	A unified view of a wide range of adversary classes and composition principles for reasoning about security properties of systems are cornerstones of a science of security. They provide a systematic basis for security analysis by explaining and predicting attacks on systems.
5834868825ff05a97b01657d	Differences in perceptual and cognitive abilities between the young and elderly have implications for in-car tasks. As a primary example, although in-car navigation systems enhance situational awareness, this comes at the cost of increasing visual distraction and cognitive load. To address these shortcomings, this paper explores the efficacy of multi-modal cues for providing route guidance information. We present the results of a study evaluating the impact of multi-modal feedback on driving performance and cognitive load.

5834868825ff05a97b016581	In this paper we look at how socialization in a community can be used to help computer illiterate users start using computers and internet in a few minutes. We describe a prototype system, Jadoo, which can be used by computer literates to create and distribute paper user interfaces. This paper interface can then be used by computer illiterates to access online information. We tested Jadoo with our target audience, people living in rural India, and iterated the design to fit their needs.

The system is based on multiple linguistically-motivated features and an adaptable framework for different datasets. The formal run scores are 54.6%(accuracy in BC), 66.7%(accuracy in Entrance Exam), and 29.8%(MRR in RITE4QA) which outperformed strong baselines, and are relatively good among participants. We also describe in-house experimental results (eg ablation study for measuring feature contribution).
58ce2af6c50f90cdd388eede	Event Mention detection is the first step in textual event understanding. Proper evaluation is important for modern natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we present our evaluation algorithm and results during the Event Mention Evaluation pilot study. We analyze the problems of evaluating multiple event mention attributes and discontinuous event mention spans. In addition, we identify a few limitations in the evaluation algorithm used for the pilot task and propose some potential improvements.
58cbcf30c50f90cdd387a0a2	A Design Automation System for the RT level of design is described. The System explores the design space by finding alternative implementations for a user given behavioral specification. The alternative solutions are obtained by transformations on a graph model. These transformations effect trade-offs between the cost of the hardware and the speed of the algorithm. Heuristic routines are used to reduce the design space by exploring only those alternatives whose characteristics approach a user given set of goals.
58cbcf5dc50f90cdd387a0c0	The development of an embedded-computer system with a visual interface is described. The authors detail the use of a target system simulator and a prototype printed circuit board (PCB), which facilitated a concurrent approach to the design of the hardware, software, and housing. They outline this codesign process and illustrate its effects with comparative data from the earlier VuMan 1 project.
58cd7488c50f90cdd3888fb5	Until very recently, complete characterization of the megagenomes of conifers has remained elusive. The diploid genome of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.) has a highly repetitive, 31 billion bp genome. It is the largest genome sequenced and assembled to date, and the first from the subgenus Strobus, or white pines, a group that is notable for having the largest genomes among the pines. The genome represents a unique opportunity to investigate genome “obesity” in conifers and white pines. Comparative analysis of P.

This is in fact the mission of the Lit2Quit mobile game designers and researchers. Drawing on cognitive and behavioral change research, Lit2Quit has designed a health game with an innovative breath-control design element, which by mimicking the physiological and perceived effects of nicotine could help smokers reduce or quit their smoking habit.
58ce75e1c50f90cdd38916ae	The Temporal Coding Hypothesis of Miller and colleagues [7] suggests that animals integrate related temporal patterns of stimuli into single memory representations. We formalize this concept using quasi-Bayes estimation to update the parameters of a constrained hidden Markov model. This approach allows us to account for some surprising temporal effects in the second order conditioning experiments of Miller et al.[1, 2, 3], which other models are unable to explain.
58ce78a4c50f90cdd389182b	Cerberus is one of the four new teams in the RoboCup Tournament, Legged Robot Category. The team is a joint effort of Boğaziçi University (Turkey) and Technical University of Sofia, Branch Plovdiv (Bulgaria). We have divided the robot software design into six major tasks, and worked on those tasks in parallel. With limited time in our hands, our aims were a clear object oriented design, readable behavior architecture.
58ce78bbc50f90cdd3891835	The Tekkotsu “crew” is a collection of interacting software components designed to relieve a programmer of much of the burden of specifying low-level robot behaviors. Using this abstract approach to robot programming we can teach beginning roboticists to develop interesting robot applications with relatively little effort.
5834868825ff05a97b0177e3	Nanoscale technologies provide both challenges and opportunities. We show that the issues and potential solutions facing designers are technology independent and arise mainly from shrinking device sizes and an increase in the number of devices available. We explore how it is possible to use some of the devices that will be available to help ease design complexity as well as overcome process related challenges such as limited layout freedom, increased defect densities, timing constraints, and power dissipation.
5834868825ff05a97b0177e6	The design challenge for huge-scale multiprocessors is (1) to minimize communication overhead,(2) allow communication to overlap computation. and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost/performance. We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead. but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple communication mechanism.
5834868825ff05a97b01663c	Code review is a difficult process because:(1) developers often create tangled commits,(2) a change may be scattered across many different parts of a project,(3) many changes are shadowed,(4) commit messages can be inaccurate or wrong. This work aims to propose a solution to these problems by exploiting the information provided by fine-grained IDE events. To put this solution in practice, we will develop a code review tool named Griotte in the Pharo IDE.
5834868825ff05a97b0177e8	Speedups of coupled processor-FPGA systems over traditional microprocessor systems are limited by the cost of hardware reconfiguration. In this paper we compare several new configuration caching algorithms that reduce the latency of reconfiguration. We also present a cache replacement strategy for a 3-level hierarchy. Using the techniques we present, total latency for loading the configurations is reduced, lowering the configurable overhead.
58ce7af7c50f90cdd389196b	A model of phonological processing in speech production based on prosodic licensing can capture general patterns of errors found in both normal and aphasic speech. All segments must be licensed by some prosodic category (syllable, nucleus, or rime) in order to be produced. Constraints on licensing, including both phonotactic and binding constraints, ensure that only correct licensing associations are retained. A computer simulation of our model produces utterances in qualitative agreement with human speech error data.
5834868825ff05a97b0177fb	In this paper we describe a Configuration PRofiling tool (CPR) and show how it can be used to aid compiler designers, FPGA architects and in the construction of macro-generator libraries. CPR uses subgraph matching to identify the parts of an application which are most important to achieve high performance. Using CPR as a guide we implemented a few macros for a macro-generator library, which yielded significant improvement in both the quality of configurations and speed of compilation.
5834868825ff05a97b0177fc	Chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN) is a promising alternative to CMOS-based computing. However; CAEN-based circuits are expected to have huge defect densities. To solve this problem CAEN can be used to build reconfigurable fabrics which, assuming the defects can be found, are inherently defect tolerant. In this paper; we propose a scalable testing methodology for finding defects in reconfigurable devices.
5834868825ff05a97b017730	In this work, we present a method for single-view reasoning about 3D surfaces and their relationships. We propose the use of mid-level constraints for 3D scene understanding in the form of convex and concave edges and introduce a generic framework capable of incorporating these and other constraints. Our method takes a variety of cues and uses them to infer a consistent interpretation of the scene. We demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the art and produce interpretations of the scene that link large planar surfaces.
58cbcfd2c50f90cdd387a113	This paper explores the system-level power-performance tradeoffs of dynamically varying CPU speed. Previous work in CPU speed-setting considered only the power of the CPU and only CPUs that vary supply voltage with frequency. This work takes a broader approach, considering total system power, battery capacity, and main memory bandwidth. The results, which are up to a factor of four less than ideal, show that all three must be considered when setting the CPU speed.
5834868825ff05a97b017aae	Today's social-coding tools foreshadow a transformation of the software industry, as it relies increasingly on open libraries, frameworks, and code fragments. Our vision calls for new intelligently transparent services that support rapid development of innovative products while helping developers manage risk and issuing them early warnings of looming failures. Intelligent transparency is enabled by an infrastructure that applies analytics to data from all phases of the life cycle of open source projects, from development to deployment.
58cbd056c50f90cdd387a172	The paper describes the mobile information and communication aspects of a next generation train maintenance and diagnosis system, discusses the working prototype features, and research results. Wearable/Mobile computers combined with the wireless technology improve efficiency and accuracy of the maintenance work. This technology enables maintenance personnel at the site to communicate with a remote helpdesk/expertise center through digital data, audio, and image.
5834868825ff05a97b017755	Many interesting real world domains involve reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. Efficient learning in such domains is important, but existing sample complexity bounds for partially observable RL are at least exponential in the episode length. We give, to our knowledge, the first partially observable RL algorithm with a polynomial bound on the number of episodes on which the algorithm may not achieve near-optimal performance. Our algorithm is suitable for an important class of episodic POMDPs.
5834868825ff05a97b017759	Order picking accounts for over 50% of the annual $150 billion spent in warehouse operations in the United States. 80% of order picking is performed manually. We compare the industry default of unassisted paper-list picking and three techniques augmented with weight checking: pick-by-light, pick-by-HUD (head-up display), and a combination of light and HUD. HUD+ light had the fastest picking (19% faster than paper) and a low number of errors (67% fewer than paper).
58cd8e25c50f90cdd3889d09	Poisoning is an emerging problem worldwide. According to WHO, 3 million acute poisoning cases with 2, 20,000 deaths occur annually. Of these, 90% of fatal poisoning occurs in developing countries mainly among agricultural workers. It is estimated that more than 50,000 people die every year from toxic exposure in India.
5834868825ff05a97b017b61	Evaluating retrieval systems in a controlled environment with a large set of topics has been the core paradigm in the information retrieval community. Voorhees and Buckley proposed to estimate the reliability of retrieval experiments by calculating the probability of making wrong effectiveness judgments between two retrieval systems over two retrieval experiments [2], which is called Retrieval Experiment Error Rate (REER) in this paper. They have successfully shown how the topic set sizes affect the retrieval experiment reliability.

5834868825ff05a97b015f0f	Over the last few years, the efficient learnability of logic programs has been studied extensively. Positive and negative learnability results now exist for a number of restricted classes of logic programs that are closely related to the classes used in practice within inductive logic programming. This paper surveys these results, and also introduces some of the more useful techniques for deriving such results. The paper does not assume any prior background in computational learning theory.
58ce36d7c50f90cdd388f54c	Knowledge-based interlingual machine translation systems produce semantically accurate translations, but typically require massive knowledge acquisition. This paper describes KANT, a system that reduces this requirement to produce practical, scalable, and accurate KBMT applications. First, the set of requirements is discussed, then the full KANT architecture is illustrated, and finally results from a fully implemented prototype are presented.
58ce376bc50f90cdd388f59e	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
58c88b0ec50f90cdd3858422	In this paper we present our work on Task 1 Acoustic Scene Classi-fication and Task 3 Sound Event Detection in Real Life Recordings. Among our experiments we have low-level and high-level features, classifier optimization and other heuristics specific to each task. Our performance for both tasks improved the baseline from DCASE: for Task 1 we achieved an overall accuracy of 78.9% compared to the baseline of 72.6% and for Task 3 we achieved a Segment-Based Error Rate of 0.76 compared to the baseline of 0.91.

5834868825ff05a97b0165b9	We introduce a framework for lightweight dependency syntax annotation. Our formalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies, permitting a simple notation and annotation workflow. Moreover, the formalism encourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would streamline the annotation process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this annotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare underspecified annotations.

58ce4753c50f90cdd388fe1d	Tarjan has given an algorithm for deciding isomorphism of two groups of order n (given as multiplication tables) which runs in O (n (log 2 n+ O (1)) steps where n is the order of the groups. Tarjan uses the fact that a group of n is generated by log n elements. In this paper, we show that Tarjan's technique generalizes to isomorphism of quasigroups, latin squares, Steiner systems, and many graphs generated from these combinatorial objects.
58c8aaa8c50f90cdd385970a	In prior work, we investigated the application of a spherical microphone array to a distant speech recognition task. In that work, the relative positions of a fixed loud speaker and the spherical array required for beamforming were measured with an optical tracking device. In the present work, we investigate how these relative positions can be determined automatically for real, human speakers based solely on acoustic evidence. We first derive an expression for the complex pressure field of a plane wave scattering from a rigid sphere.
58cb62dec50f90cdd38754ef	Research suggests that a main image on a homepage creates a distinct visual hierarchy that maybe inherently appealing to people. This in turn suggests that main images may play an important role in shaping user aesthetic reactions to a homepage. Research also shows that images of people are effective in drawing attention and that these images are pleasing to users. Grounded in these two lines of research, we show that fixation on main images has significant positive relation to visual appeal ratings of 24 homepages.
5834868825ff05a97b0177b9	Standard entity clustering systems commonly rely on mention (string) matching, syntactic features, and linguistic resources like English WordNet. When co-referent text mentions appear in different languages, these techniques cannot be easily applied. Consequently, we develop new methods for clustering text mentions across documents and languages simultaneously, producing cross-lingual entity clusters. Our approach extends standard clustering algorithms with cross-lingual mention and context similarity measures.
58cbd2b1c50f90cdd387a31c	This paper deals with the design of hierarchically structured programming systems. It develops a method for evaluating the cost of requiring programmers to work with an abstraction of a real machine. A number of examples from hardware and software are given as illustrations of the method.
58cdea64c50f90cdd388cd0f	This paper describes the annotation process being used in a multi-site project to create six sizable bilingual parallel corpora annotated with a consistent interlingua representation. After presenting the background and objectives of the effort, we describe the multilingual corpora and the three stages of interlingual representation being developed. We then focus on the annotation process itself, including an interface environment that supports the annotation task, and the methodology for evaluating the interlingua representation.

58caf0a1c50f90cdd3870718	Multiprocessing environments such as Unix are susceptible to race conditions on the file space, since processes share files in the system. A process accessing a file may get unexpected results while executing in a critical section if the binding between the file name and the file object is altered by another process. Such errors, called time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) binding flaws, are among...

A molecular latch and a method using the latch that enables it to act as a state holding device, perform voltage restoration, and to provide I/O isolation is disclosed.
5834868825ff05a97b0177d9	We examine how modular robots can be used to enable remote robotic construction of planetary and orbital outposts. Each modular robot, called a catom, contains sufficient actuation, adhesion, control, and power to allow it to function as part of an ensemble of similar units. We describe the catom design and construction as well as initial experiments carried out to verify the system.
5834868825ff05a97b016565	This issue's Applications column revisits location-based applications and how far we've come since the original mobile device location-detection research started about 10 years ago. The authors discuss a number of popular location-based services and the speed at which such services have become available and commonplace. They also raise some issues about further technical challenges in privacy that result from such widespread use.
58cdee75c50f90cdd388cf47	Consider maintaining a search data structure for performing point location in a Delaunay triangulation in arbitrary dimension d. One typical structure used for this purpose is the history DAG of Guibas et al. We show that, interestingly, the history DAG can be thought of as a regular triangulation in d+ 1 dimensions. This leads very naturally to a simple algorithm for performing an operation analogous to rotation in binary trees.
5834868825ff05a97b01664c	Research in assistive systems for travelers who are blind/low vision (B/LV) has been largely focused on basic map information. We present NavCue, an intelligent system module for providing rich, multi-sensory, context-based information using speech guidance and robot physical gestures. This approach is motivated by our previous user studies with people who are blind or low vision. This rich information should enhance user location awareness and confidence when traveling through unfamiliar locations.
58ce7baac50f90cdd38919ca	We describe a framework for learning saccadic eye movements using a photometric representation of target points in natural scenes. The representation takes the form of a high-dimensional vector comprised of the responses of spatial filters at different orientations and scales. We first demonstrate the use of this response vector in the task of locating previously foveated points in a scene and subsequently use this property in a multisaccade strategy to derive an adaptive motor map for delivering accurate saccades.
58ce7c6bc50f90cdd3891a33	Cognitive robotics is an approach to robot programming that draws inspiration from ideas in cognitive science, such as visual routines (Ullman 1984), dual-coding representations (Paivio 1986), and perceivable affordances (Gibson 1977; 1979). We have implemented primitives based on these ideas as part of Tekkotsu, an open source application development framework for the Sony AIBO.
58ce7c94c50f90cdd3891a49	Subtle differences in the method of constructing arguments in inheritance systems can result in profound differences in both the conclusions reached and the efficiency of inference. This paper focuses on issues surrounding the defeat of arguments in nonmonotonic inheritance. Looking primarily at skeptical reasoners, we analyze several types of defeat that may be encountered, especially the defeat of defeaters. Finally, we raise some questions specific to networks that mix strict and defeasible links.

In particular, we have focused on the problem of improving the performance of algorithms for the semantic labeling of images through the use of information from street maps (Figure 1). This is an important step toward a realistic design of a perception system that is truly integrated with all the sources of information.

58cdf1b6c50f90cdd388d115	The seminal paper of Caponnetto and de Vito (2007) provides minimax-optimal rates for kernel ridge regression in a very general setting. Its proof, however, contains an error in its bound on the effective dimensionality. In this note, we explain the mistake, provide a correct bound, and show that the main theorem remains true.
58cdf3bec50f90cdd388d22f	We present an efficient algorithm for solving a linear system arising from the 1-Laplacian corresponding to a collapsible simplicial complex with a known collapsing sequence. When combined with a result of Chillingworth, our algorithm is applicable to convex simplicial complexes embedded in R 3. The running time of our algorithm is nearly-linear in the size of the complex and is logarithmic on its numerical properties.
58cbf126c50f90cdd387b7ea	We present a logic for reasoning about properties of secure systems. The logic is built around a concurrent programming language with constructs for modeling machines with shared memory, a simple form of access control on memory, machine resets, cryptographic operations, network communication, and dynamically loading and executing unknown (and potentially untrusted) code. The adversary's capabilities are constrained by the system interface as defined in the programming model (leading to the name CSI-ADVERSARY).

5834868825ff05a97b0165bd	We describe a synchronous parsing algorithm that is based on two successive monolingual parses of an input sentence pair. Although the worst-case complexity of this algorithm is and must be O (n 6) for binary SCFGs, its average-case run-time is far better. We demonstrate that for a number of common synchronous parsing problems, the two-parse algorithm substantially outperforms alternative synchronous parsing strategies, making it efficient enough to be utilized without resorting to a pruned search.
58cb6302c50f90cdd3875508	Compression can be achieved by exploiting knowledge both internal and external to a given image or video source. In this paper, we present means for generating and exploiting the specific external knowledge of a 3D stereoscopic depth map of the given scene to compress the given monoscopic source. Several instances in which the depth map can potentially increase compression or provide improved functionality are presented to motivate further work along this line of reasoning.
58cc6553c50f90cdd388016a	The CMU MIDI Toolkit supports the development of complex interactive computer music performance systems.

These features are described and then illustrated by their use in two performance systems.
58ce8113c50f90cdd3891cb6	Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for> 10 min.
5834868825ff05a97b0165c6	This paper addresses the problem of producing a diverse set of plausible translations. We present a simple procedure that can be used with any statistical machine translation (MT) system. We explore three ways of using diverse translations:(1) system combination,(2) discriminative reranking with rich features, and (3) a novel post-editing scenario in which multiple translations are presented to users. We find that diversity can improve performance on these tasks, especially for sentences that are difficult for MT.

We also discuss the experimental results obtained with this system on the most recent DARPA evaluation, and some subsequent results are also discussed.
58ce68f5c50f90cdd3890fb2	We present a computational theory of mid-level vision within the Line Pair micro-domain, implemented in Mathematica. The theory assumes that categorization is the fundamental aspect of understanding, and that binding, symmetry, regularity detection, and proportionality detection are the mechanisms by which we categorize instances. We discuss additional aspects of “understanding” the domain, and suggest other domains to which the theory might transfer.
58cc6a15c50f90cdd38803fa	All computer music work depends upon the ability of computers to make sound. How do they do it? In this introduction, we will attempt to provide a plausible answer without plunging into technical details. The answer begins with the observation that sound is a vibration, and sound is transmitted to our ears as rapid changes in air pressure. The atmosphere normally exerts a constant pressure, which by itself is silent, but vibrations that cause the pressure to go slightly above and slightly below the normal pressure can be perceived as sound.
58cb66a9c50f90cdd387579e	An intelligent gas sensor has been developed using thick-film techniques to create a semiconducting oxide surface with carefully varied catalytic properties. An integral heater causes the surface to react with combustible gases and the resulting resistance map of the surface forms a signature that can be related to the functional groups present in the gas. For example, alcohols, ketones and alkanes have distinct, recognisable signatures on one sensor model.

5834868825ff05a97b0165ca	We develop a supersense taxonomy for adjectives, based on that of GermaNet, and apply it to English adjectives in WordNet using human annotation and supervised classification. Results show that accuracy for automatic adjective type classification is high, but synsets are considerably more difficult to classify, even for trained human annotators. We release the manually annotated data, the classifier, and the induced supersense labeling of 12,304 WordNet adjective synsets.
5834868825ff05a97b0178cf	The ability to transfer knowledge gained in previous tasks into new contexts is one of the most important mechanisms of human learning. Despite this, adapting autonomous behavior to be reused in partially similar settings is still an open problem in current robotics research. In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic framework for learning transferable motion policies. Our goal is to solve a learning problem in a target domain by utilizing the training data in a different but related source domain.

58c9154fc50f90cdd385d66a	In this paper we show that optimal stepping trajectories and trajectory cost for a walking biped robot on rough terrain can be encoded as simple quadratic functions of initial state and footstep sequence. In order to find this encoding, we build a database of optimal walking trajectories for a 3D humanoid model by sampling the input space (initial state and footstep sequence) and solving a physically-based trajectory optimization problem for each sample. Then, the function coefficients are obtained by fitting the data using least squares.
58ce6b1ac50f90cdd38910dd	M3P is a computational model of phonology based on parallel mapping matrices. Rules govern the mappings between successive levels of representation of an utterance, from morphphonemic, to phonemic, to phonetic. The mapping matrix architecture performs several types of sequence manipulation. MP shows that human phonological processing can take place in a highly constrained architecture, using purely feed-forward circuitry and tight limits on depth of derivations.
58cb31cdc50f90cdd387333d	Sensor fusion architecture varies according application situations. From the information processing model point of view, sensor fusion can be roughly grouped into three categories [1]:(a) raw data fusion,(b) feature fusion, and (c) decision (identity declaration) fusion, as shown in Figure 1.
5834868825ff05a97b01793e	A fast 3D tracking method of non-rigid objects is proposed. The method consists of fast ICP and modified RPM techniques for range images. By using the techniques, the authors aim real time 3D non-rigid object tracking. The authors developed an actual tracking system and show the effectiveness of the method by some experimental results.
5834868825ff05a97b0179db	Recognizing landmark is a critical task for mobile robots. Landmarks are used for robot positioning, and for building maps of unknown environments. In this context, the traditional recognition techniques based on strong geometric models cannot be used. Rather, models of landmarks must be built from observations using image-based visual learning techniques. Beyond its application to mobile robot navigation, this approach addresses the more general problem of identifying groups of images with common attributes in sequences of images.
5834868825ff05a97b01794c	In this paper we describe an approach towards integrating mid-range sensing data into a dynamic path planning algorithm. The key problem, sensing for planning is addressed in the context of outdoor navigation. An algorithmic approach is described towards solving these problems and both simulation results and initial experimental results for outdoor navigation using wide baseline stereo data are presented.
58cb8fe9c50f90cdd38773f4	Many interesting real world domains involve reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. Efficient learning in such domains is important, but existing sample complexity bounds for partially observable RL are at least exponential in the episode length. We give, to our knowledge, the first partially observable RL algorithm with a polynomial bound on the number of episodes on which the algorithm may not achieve near-optimal performance. Our algorithm is suitable for an important class of episodic POMDPs.
5834868825ff05a97b0165ef	We describe an open-source toolkit for statistical machine translation whose novel contributions are (a) support for linguistically motivated factors,(b) confusion network decoding, and (c) efficient data formats for translation models and language models. In addition to the SMT decoder, the toolkit also includes a wide variety of tools for training, tuning and applying the system to many translation tasks.
58ce705cc50f90cdd38913b4	Tekkotsu is an open source application development framework for mobile robots that promotes a high level approach or robot programming which we call “cognitive robotics”. Originally developed for the Sony AIBO, Tekkotsu now supports a variety of platforms under the Linux and Mac OS X operating systems. We present the first version of a new educational robotics platform, Regis, designed specifically for teaching cognitive robotics.
58ce2fc2c50f90cdd388f179	This paper presents the current status of work to extend the JAVELIN QA system with domain semantics for question answering in restricted domains. We discuss how the original architecture was extended, and how the system modules must be adjusted to incorporate knowledge from existing ontologies and information provided by third-party annotation tools.
5834868825ff05a97b016591	In Sorani Kurdish, one of the most useful orthographic features in named-entity recognition–capitalization–is absent, as the language's Perso-Arabic script does not make a distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. We describe a system for deriving an inferred capitalization value from closely related languages by phonological similarity, and illustrate the system using several related Western Iranian languages.
5834868825ff05a97b016594	We present an extension of phrase-based statistical machine translation models that enables the straight-forward integration of additional annotation at the word-level—may it be linguistic markup or automatically generated word classes. In a number of experiments we show that factored translation models lead to better translation performance, both in terms of automatic scores, as well as more grammatical coherence.
58cc1d47c50f90cdd387d5f1	We present POMP (Pareto Optimal Motion Planner), an anytime algorithm for geometric path planning on roadmaps. For robots with several degrees of freedom, collision checks are computationally expensive and often dominate planning time. Our goal is to minimize the number of collision checks for obtaining the first feasible path and successively shorter feasible paths. We assume that the roadmaps we search over are embedded in a continuous ambient space, where nearby points tend to share the same collision state.
5834868825ff05a97b016599	We consider the task of identifying and labeling the semantic arguments of a predicate that evokes a FrameNet frame. This task is challenging because there are only a few thousand fully annotated sentences for supervised training. Our approach augments an existing model with features derived from FrameNet and PropBank and with partially annotated exemplars from FrameNet. We observe a 4% absolute increase in F1 versus the original model.
58cb4b39c50f90cdd3874494	This report describes a research program to evaluate if any state-of-the-art robotics technology is applicable to a hazardous-response robot for the Coast Guard. In general, little is known about the conditions facing a Coast Guard Strike Team when a chemical spill is initially encountered. This makes reconnaissance work both important and extremely hazardous. One way to reduce some of the risks facing the strike teams would be to first dispatch a reconnaissance robot to gather data and record images of the hazardous area.
58cc28bec50f90cdd387de03	Rotorcraft operating in unprepared locations must be capable of safe flight in the presence of unmapped obstacles and absence of GPS, and must be able to quickly and reliably assess a potential landing zone's suitability for landing. This paper presents technologies that address these needs and the result of their application to an actual unmanned helicopter prototype.
5834868825ff05a97b017382	We describe a method to extract tabular data from web pages. Rather than just analyzing the DOM tree, we also exploit visual cues in the rendered version of the document to extract data from tables which are not explicitly marked with an HTML table element. To detect tables, we rely on a variant of the well-known XY cut algorithm as used in the OCR community. We implemented the system by directly accessing Mozilla's box model that contains the positional data for all HTML elements of a given web page.
58cbc816c50f90cdd3879ba0	The MICON system, which synthesizes a single-board computer design from a high-level description of the board's functions and design constraints, is described. The synthesis process is based on designing subsystems (eg processor, memory, input/output) individually and then forming a full system design from the results. MICON has the added capability of design for reliability, automatically synthesizing boards that meet given reliability criteria. The quality of the design produced is strongly dependent on the knowledge in the system.
58cbc834c50f90cdd3879bb5	The MICON Synthesizer Version 1 (M1) is a rule-based system which produces a complete small computer design from a set of abstract specifications. Ml's design ability depends on the encoding of large, amounts of domain knowledge. An automated knowledge acquisition tool, CGEN, works synergistically with M1 by gathering knowledge of bow to build and when to use various computer structures. This paper overviews the operation of CGEN by providing an example of the types of knowledge acquired and the mechanisms employed.
58ce71adc50f90cdd389146b	Hand-eye systems combine computer vision with kinematics and dynamics calculations to achieve dexterous manipulation. These versatile platforms for teaching robotics principles have not been widely used in undergraduate laboratories due to cost. We describe a new hand-eye system constructed from Robotis Dynamixel servos, a USB interface module, and a webcam, that can be built for under $500 and run by a PC using the Tekkotsu open source software framework. A suggested curriculum is outlined.
58cdec42c50f90cdd388ce11	This report is one of five reports that were based on the MINDS workshops, led by Donna Harman (NIST) and sponsored by Heather McCallum-Bayliss of the Disruptive Technology Office of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's Office of Science and Technology (ODNI/ADDNI/S&T/DTO).

5834868825ff05a97b01660d	There is currently a growing interest in personal health technologies using data collection strategies to develop context-aware systems. The insights from this data could help patients and clinicians monitor and manage mental illness. We describe our approach to support the data analysis and feedback to clinicians and patients through extending the MONARCA Self-Assessment System.
5834868825ff05a97b015f3e	A method and apparatus is provided for producing a general data extraction procedure capable of extracting data from data sources on a network regardless of data format. The general data extraction procedure is determined from a plurality of pairs of data from the network, each pair including a data source and a program which accurately extracts data from the data source. The pairs of data are processed by a learning system to learn a general program for extracting data from new data sources.
5834868825ff05a97b017a15	Despite the fact that color is a powerful cue in object recognition, the extraction of scale-invariant interest regions from color images frequently begins with a conversion of the image to grayscale. The isolation of interest points is then completely determined by luminance, and the use of color is deferred to the stage of descriptor formation. This seemingly innocuous conversion to grayscale is known to suppress saliency and can lead to representative regions being undetected by procedures based only on luminance.
58c91355c50f90cdd385d534	PEOPLE ARE SKILLED at perceiving the subtle details of human motion. We can, for example, often identify friends by the style of their walk when they are too far away to be recognizable otherwise. As a result of this skill, we have high standards for the motion of virtual human actors. If synthesized human motion is to be compelling, the virtual actors must appear realistic and move in a natural fashion.
58ce6b6ac50f90cdd3891109	Upon closer examination, and depending on who you read,“symbol grounding” turns out to be either the induction of trivial sensory predicates or the relabeling of a large portion of intelligent behavior as “transduction.” Neither activity shows much promise for advancing our understanding of intelli-gence, although symbol grounding does have some utility in philosophical debates. The proper concern for symbol processing researchers, both connectionist and classical, is to construct and manipulate symbols, not to ground them.
58ce6bedc50f90cdd3891150	We present a model of the rat head direction cell circuit that accounts for the recently discovered bimodality and distortion observed in the tuning curves of anterior thalamic head direction cells. This model also explains why anterior thalamic head direction cells show a constant amount of anticipation across all angular velocities.
5834868825ff05a97b01659d	We present morphogen, a tool for improving translation into morphologically rich languages with synthetic phrases. We approach the problem of translating into morphologically rich languages in two phases. First, an inflection model is learned to predict target word inflections from source side context. Then this model is used to create additional sentence specific translation phrases. These “synthetic phrases” augment the standard translation grammars and decoding proceeds normally with a standard translation model.
58ce3226c50f90cdd388f2c5	Despite considerable theoretical and computational work on coreference, deciding when two entities or events are identical is very difficult. In a project to build corpora containing coreference links between events, we have identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none). Event coreference annotation on two corpora was performed to validate the findings.
58ca65abc50f90cdd386a93f	This paper studies the temporal communication patterns of online communities of developers and users of the open source Eclipse Java development environment. It measures the productivity of each community and seeks to identify correlations that exist between group communication characteristics and productivity attributes. The study uses the TeCFlow (Temporal Communication Flow) visualizer to create...
5834868825ff05a97b017399	This report contains supporting evidence for claims put forth and explained in the paper “Statically Typed String Sanitation Inside a Python”[1], including proofs of lemmas and theorems asserted in the paper, examples, additional discussion of the paper's technical content, and errata.
5834868825ff05a97b01739b	Programmers often wish to validate or sanitize user input. One common approach to this problem is the use of regular expressions. Unvalidated or insufficiently sanitized user input can cause security problems. Therefore, a compile-time guarantee that input sanitation algorithms are implemented and used correctly could ensure the absence of certain sorts of vulnerabilities. This thesis presents $\\lcs $, a typed lambda calculus which captures the essential properties necessary to achieve such a guarantee.
5834868825ff05a97b017635	We demonstrate a probabilistic construction of binary linear codes meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (with overwhelming probability) for rates up to about 10− 4, together with polynomial time algorithms to perform encoding and decoding up to half the distance. This is the first such result (for some positive rate) with polynomial decoding complexity; previously a similar result (up to rate about 0.02) was known with sub-exponential time decoding (Zyablov and Pinsker, 1981).
5834868825ff05a97b01739d	Researchers interested in security often wish to introduce new primitives into a language. Extensible languages hold promise in such scenarios, but only if the extension mechanism is sufficiently safe and expressive. This paper describes several modifications to an extensible language motivated by end-to-end security concerns.
58cbc957c50f90cdd3879c81	This is an elaboration of the paperSynchronization and matching in redundant systems' by Davies and Wakerly (ibid., vol. 27, p. 531-9, 1978). The design of voters for synchronization is strongly dependent on the signaling convention used. This correspondence presents voter designs for three different signaling conventions (transition, level, and pulse). The issue of improved voter performance is also addressed.
5834868825ff05a97b0173a0	We describe fully polynomial randomized approximation schemes for the problems of determining the number of Hamilton paths and cycles in an n-vertex graph with minimum degree (12+\\a)n, for any fixed a> 0. We show that the exact counting problems are# P-complete. We also describe fully polynomial randomized approximation schemes for counting paths and cycles of all sizes in such graphs.
5834868825ff05a97b0173a2	We consider the problem of sampling according to a distribution with log-concave density F over a convex body $ K\\subseteq\\mathbf {R}^ n $. The sampling is done using a biased random walk and we give improved polynomial upper bounds on the time to get a sample point with distribution close to F.
58ca80e2c50f90cdd386baff	A spatiotemporal technique for checking the consistency of stereo range results and integrating them over time is presented. This technique is designed as part of a passive ranging system whose goal is to produce range images with as high a resolution as possible in order to support the detection of as small objects as possible. The basic approach is to minimize the application of spatial aggregation operations, which reduce resolution, and to apply a set of multiple-match consistency checks over space and time to lter out mistakes.
5834868825ff05a97b0173a4	In recent years there has been considerable progress on the analysis of Markov chains for generating a random coloring of an input graph. These improvements have come in conjunction with refinements of the coupling technique, which is a classical tool in probability theory. We survey results on generating random colorings, and related technical improvements.

5834868825ff05a97b015f03	A close relationship exists between the advancement of face recognition algorithms and the availability of face databases varying factors that affect facial appearance in a controlled manner. The CMU PIE database has been very influential in advancing research in face recognition across pose and illumination. Despite its success the PIE database has several shortcomings: a limited number of subjects, a single recording session and only few expressions captured. To address these issues we collected the CMU Multi-PIE database.
58ce334fc50f90cdd388f365	A methodology is presented for component-based machine translation (MT) evaluation through causal error analysis to complement existing global evaluation methods. This methodology is particularly appropriate for knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) systems. After a discussion of MT evaluation criteria and the particular evaluation metrics proposed for KBMT, we apply this methodology to a large-scale application of the KANT machine translation system, and present some sample results.
5834868825ff05a97b015f06	One of the “grand challenges for machine learning” is the problem of learning from textbooks. This paper addresses the problem of learning from texts including omissions and inconsistencies that are clarified by illustrative examples. To avoid problems in natural language understanding, we consider a simplification of this problem in which the text has been manually translated into a logical theory. This learning problem is solvable by a technique that we call analogical abductive explanation based learning (ANA-EBL).
5834868825ff05a97b0165a8	We describe the CMU submission for the 2014 shared task on language identification in code-switched data. We participated in all four language pairs: Spanish–English, Mandarin–English, Nepali–English, and Modern Standard Arabic–Arabic dialects. After describing our CRF-based baseline system, we discuss three extensions for learning from unlabeled data: semi-supervised learning, word embeddings, and word lists.
5834868825ff05a97b0165a9	We introduce recurrent neural network grammars, probabilistic models of sentences with explicit phrase structure. We explain efficient inference procedures that allow application to both parsing and language modeling. Experiments show that they provide better parsing in English than any single previously published supervised generative model and better language modeling than state-of-the-art sequential RNNs in English and Chinese.
5834868825ff05a97b0177f5	As the size of the modules in a self-reconfiguring modular robotic system shrinks and the number of modules increases, the flexibility of the system as a whole increases. In this paper, we describe the manufacturing methods and mechanisms for a 1 millimeter diameter module which can be manufactured en masse. The module is the first step towards realizing the basic unit of claytronics, a modular robotic system designed to scale to millions of units.
5834868825ff05a97b016655	Modern development environments handle information about the intent of the programmer: for example, they use abstract syntax trees for providing high-level code manipulation such as refactorings; nevertheless, they do not keep track of this information in a way that would simplify code sharing and change understanding. In most Smalltalk systems, source code modifications are immediately registered in a transaction log often called a ChangeSet. Such mechanism has proven reliability, but it has several limitations.
58ce7d79c50f90cdd3891ac6	O'Keefe (1991) has proposed that spatial information in rats might be represented as phasors: phase and amplitude of a sine wave encoding angle and distance to a landmark. We describe computer simulations showing that operations on phasors can be efficiently realized by arrays of spiking neurons that recode the temporal dimension of the sine wave spatially. Some cells in motor and parietal cortex exhibit response properties compatible with this proposal.
5834868825ff05a97b01785c	Appropriate datasets are required at all stages of object recognition research, including learning visual models of object and scene categories, detecting and localizing instances of these models in images, and evaluating the performance of recognition algorithms. Current datasets are lacking in several respects, and this paper discusses some of the lessons learned from existing efforts, as well as innovative ways to obtain very large and diverse annotated datasets. It also suggests a few criteria for gathering future datasets.

5834868825ff05a97b016668	Less than 3% of the 145 million blind people living in developing countries are literate. This low literacy rate is in part due to the lack of trained teachers and the challenges associated with learning to write Braille on a traditional slate and stylus. These challenges include writing from right to left, writing mirrored images of letters, and receiving significantly delayed feedback. Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind in Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost Braille writing tutor.
58ce7ff8c50f90cdd3891c1c	There is a natural partial ordering of defaults in inheritance systems that resolves ambiguities in an intuitive way. This is not the shortest-path ordering used by most existing inheritance reasoners. The flaws of the shortest-path ordering become apparent when we consider multiple inheritance. We define the correct partial ordering to use in inheritance and show how it applies to semantic network systems. Use of this ordering also simplifies the representation of inheritance in default logic.
5834868825ff05a97b01667b	Less than 3% of the 145 million blind people living in developing countries are literate. This low literacy rate is partly due to the lack of trained teachers and the challenges associated with learning to write Braille on a traditional slate and stylus. These challenges include writing from right to left, writing mirrored images of letters, and receiving significantly delayed feedback. Extensive conversations with the Mathru School for the Blind near Bangalore, India, revealed the need for a robust, low-power, low-cost Braille writing tutor.
5834868825ff05a97b0173a7	r-regular n-vertex graph G with random independent edge lengths, each uniformly distributed on (0, 1). Let mst (G) be the expected length of a minimum spanning tree. We show that mst (G) can be estimated quite accurately under two distinct circumstances. Firstly, if r is large and G has a modest edge expansion property then, where. Secondly, if G has large girth then there exists an explicitly defined constant such that. We find in particular that.
5834868825ff05a97b017851	The Metaphor is intended to contribute to the Agile Programming value of communication. Previously, some of the author studied the Metaphor as a means of communication among team members and between them and clients. This paper examines the Metaphor's contribution to the software architecture. Both experiments seemto reveal that the Metaphor has poor effectiveness.
5834868825ff05a97b0173a8	We discuss the application of random walks to generating a random basis of a totally unimodular matrix and to solving a linear program with such a constraint matrix. We also derive polynomial upper bounds on the combinatorial diameter of an associated polyhedron.
5834868825ff05a97b017644	Much progress has been made on decoding algorithms for error-correcting codes in the last decade. In this article, we give an introduction to some fundamental results on iterative, message-passing algorithms for low-density parity check codes. For certain important stochastic channels, this line of work has enabled getting very close to Shannon capacity with algorithms that are extremely efficient (both in theory and practice).
5834868825ff05a97b0173ac	We extend and strengthen the result that, in the complete graph K n with independent random edge-lengths uniformly distributed on [0, 1], the expected length of the minimum spanning tree tends to ζ (3) as n→∞. In particular, if K n is replaced by the complete bipartite graph K n, n then there is a corresponding limit of 2ζ (3).
5834868825ff05a97b0173ae	We describe a polynomial (O (n 1.5)) time algorithm DHAM for finding hamilton cycles in digraphs. For digraphs chosen uniformly at random from the set of digraphs with vertex set {1, 2,…, n} and m= m (n) edges the limiting probability (as n→∞) that DHAM finds a hamilton cycle equals the limiting probability that the digraph is hamiltonian. Some applications to random “travelling salesman problems” are discussed.
5834868825ff05a97b0173b0	Let the edges of the complete graph Kn be assigned independent uniform [0, 1] random edge weights. Let Z TSP and Z 2FAC be the weights of the minimum length travelling salesman tour and minimum weight 2-factor, respectively. We show that whp| Z TSP− Z 2FAC|= o (1). The proof is obtained by the analysis of a polynomial time algorithm that finds a tour only a little longer than Z 2FAC.
5834868825ff05a97b0173b4	The edges of the complete graph K n are coloured so that no colour appears more than k= k (n) times, k=⌈ n (A ln n)⌉, for some sufficiently large A. We show that there is always a Hamiltonian cycle in which each edge is a different colour. The proof technique is probabilistic.
5834868825ff05a97b017651	We show that all algebraic-geometric codes possess a succinct representation that allows for list decoding algorithms to run in polynomial time. We do this by presenting a root-finding algorithm for univariate polynomials over function fields when their coefficients lie in finite-dimensional linear spaces, and proving that there is a polynomial size representation, given which the root-finding algorithm runs in polynomial time.
58ce729bc50f90cdd38914e8	DCPS (the Distributed Connectionist Production System) is a neural network with complex dynamical properties. Visualizing the energy landscapes of some of its component modules leads to a better intuitive understanding of the model, and suggests ways in which its dynamics can be controlled in order to improve performance on difficult cases.
58ce2f6ec50f90cdd388f14d	We present an approach to pronominal anaphora resolution using KANT Controlled Language and the KANTOO multilingual MT system. Our algorithm is based on a robust, syntax-based approach that applies a set of restrictions and preferences to select the correct antecedent. We report a success rate of 93.3% on a training corpus with 286 anaphors, and 88.8% on held-out data with 144 anaphors. Our approach translates anaphors to Spanish with 97.9% accuracy and to German with 94.4% accuracy on held-out data.
58ce35c3c50f90cdd388f4b7	In this paper, we present an overview of the issues in designing a controlled language, the implementation of a controlled language checker, and the deployment of KANT Controlled English for multilingual machine translation. We also discuss some success criteria for introducing controlled language. Finally, future vision of KANT controlled language development is discussed.
58ce732ec50f90cdd3891539	Evaluation in Lisp and related languages proceeds according to a set of evaluation rules built into the EVAL and APPLY functions. Evaluation of the simple expression (+ 2 3) employs two of these rules. First, numbers evaluate to themselves. Second, to evaluate a list describing a function call, one first evaluates the arguments to the function, and then applies the function to the evaluated arguments. This leads to the evaltrace of (+ 2 3) in Figure 1. Thin lines represent calls to EVAL, and thick lines calls to APPLY.
58ce3dcfc50f90cdd388f8ed	Most modern meshing algorithms produce asymptotically optimal size output. However, the size of the optimal mesh may not be bounded by any function of n. In this paper, we introduce well-paced point sets and prove that these will produce linear size outputs when meshed with any “size-optimal” meshing algorithm. This work generalizes all previous work on the linear cost of balancing quadtrees. We also present an algorithm that uses well-paced points to produce a linear size Delaunay mesh of a point set in Rd.
5834868825ff05a97b016612	This paper presents our approach in context-and activity-awareness in collaborative environments and introduces a method called'LPA Walk'to identify the sequential patterns of activities and situations in physical shared settings. Using a hospital environment as an example, we show how the identification of these patterns can help specifying adaptation mechanisms that apply for each device in different situations and enable the system to recognize these patterns and act accordingly.
5834868825ff05a97b0173b9	The three-dimensional assignment problem described here is a generalisation of the classical (two-dimensional) assignment problem. It arises when three sets of entities, eg students, teachers and projects, have to be matched together to maximise some objective. As an integer programming problem it becomes: mn p maximise i--~ 1~ k= l~ aif k Xi] k'np subject to~~ xi/k= 1 i= 1,..., m,/= 1 k= l mp~ xij k<~ bj j= 1,..., n, i= 1 k= l mn~<~ clc k= l,..., pi= 1 j= l xijk xi/k= 0 or 1.
5834868825ff05a97b0173ba	We describe a time randomized algorithm that estimates the number of feasible solutions of a multidimensional knapsack problem within 1±ε of the exact number.(Here r is the number of constraints and n is the number of integer variables.) The algorithm uses a Markov chain to generate an almost uniform random solution to the problem.
5834868825ff05a97b0173be	We present a polynomial time algorithm to learn (in Valiant's PAC model) an arbitrarily oriented cube in n-space, given uniformly distributed sample points from it. In fact, we solve the more general problem of learning, in polynomial time, a linear (affine) transformation of a product distribution.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c1	We give a (Las Vegas) randomized algorithm for linear programming in a fixed dimensiond for which the expected computation time is, where lim d? 8 ed= 0. This improves the corresponding worst-case complexity,. The method is based on a recent idea of Clarkson. Two variations on the algorithm are examined briefly.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c3	We describe a polynomial time (O (n 3 log n)) algorithm which has a high probability of finding hamilton cycles in two classes of random graph which have constant average degree: the m-out model and the random regular graph model. We also show how the algorithm can be used to find a large cycle in a sparse random graph.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c4	We consider a simple model of an agent (which we call a spider) moving between the nodes of a randomly growing web graph. It is presumed that the agent examines the page content of the node for some specific topic. In our model the spider makes a random walk on the existing set of vertices. We compare the success of the spider on web graphs of two distinct types. For a random graph web graph model, in which new vertices join edges to existing vertices uniformly at random, the expected proportion of unvisited vertices tends to 0.57.
5834868825ff05a97b01651b	Welcome to the 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD2009). It is with great pleasure that we present the ICTD2009 proceedings, which include all of the full papers presented at the conference in Doha, Qatar, held on 17-19 April 2009.
58cbca85c50f90cdd3879d56	A brief survey of memory chip failure modes shows that partial chip failures are the dominant failure mode. A single error-correcting (SEC) code memory model is developed based on the results of the survey. The effect of memory support circuitry, often ignored, is included. Examples illustrate that the support circuitry dominates the memory system reliability for wide ranges of memory system parameters.
5834868825ff05a97b01765f	Folded Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are an explicit family of codes that achieve the optimal tradeoff between rate and list error-correction capability: specifically, for any ε> 0, Guruswami and Rudra presented an n O (1/ε) time algorithm to list decode appropriate folded RS codes of rate R from a fraction 1-R-ε of errors. The algorithm is based on multivariate polynomial interpolation and root-finding over extension fields. It was noted by Vadhan that interpolating a linear polynomial suffices for a statement of the above form.
5834868825ff05a97b015eab	Most automatic expression analysis systems attempt to recognize a small set of prototypic expressions (eg, happiness and anger). Such prototypic expressions, however, occur infrequently. Human emotions and intentions are communicated more often by changes in one or two discrete facial features. We develop an automatic system to analyze subtle changes in facial expressions based on both permanent (eg, mouth, eye, and brow) and transient (eg, furrows and wrinkles) facial features in a nearly frontal image sequence.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c7	A digraph with n vertices and fixed outdegree m is generated randomly so that each such digraph is equally likely to be chosen. We consider the probability of the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph obtained by ignoring arc orientation. We show that there exists m (⩽ 23) such that a Hamiltonian cycle exists with probability tending to 1 as n tends to infinity.
5834868825ff05a97b01651d	This research contributes to efforts in assessment studies related to science and technology interventions. The work presented in this thesis focuses on understanding the effects of policies that influence science and technology interventions, and determining the impact of science and technology interventions themselves.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c8	We consider linear programs in which the objective function (cost) coefficients are independent non-negative random variables, and give upper bounds for the random minimum cost. One application shows that for quadratic assignment problems with such costs certain branch-and-bound algorithms usually take more than exponential time.
5834868825ff05a97b0173c9	Let G r denote a random r-regular graph with vertex set {1, 2,…, n} and α (G r) and χ (G r) denote respectively its independence and chromatic numbers. We show that with probability going to 1 as n→∞ respectively| δ (Gr)− 2nr (logr− log logr+ 1− log 2)|⩽ γnr and| χ (Gr)− r2 log r− 8r log logr (log) 2|⩽ 8r log log r (log r) 2 provided r= o (n θ), θ< 13, 0< ε< 1, are constants, and r≥ r ε, where r ε depends on ε only.
58cbcaa6c50f90cdd3879d6e	This article describes a knowledge-based expert system, Talib, whose domain of expertise is in the cell layout phase of the IC design task. It applies Al techniques and has been used to design IC layouts in the circuit range of four to 86 transistors. The system is implemented in OPS5, a general-purpose rule-based language. Talib accepts as input the schematic of the proposed circuit along with the description of the cell layout boundary, and produces as output the description of the mask geometry in CalTech Intermediate Form.
5834868825ff05a97b01651e	Purpose The purpose of the PREval framework is to assist in the planning and execution of ICTD pilot project evaluations. Additionally, it is designed to improve reporting of project evaluation results by organizing findings in a way that would better enable decision makers to determine the best course (s) of action to take post-pilot study.
5834868825ff05a97b017663	Non-malleable codes, introduced by Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs (ICS 2010), encode messages s in a manner so that tampering the codeword causes the decoder to either output s or a message that is independent of s. While this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family F of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when lF|≤ 2 2 αn for some α< 1 where n is the number of bits in a codeword).
58ce34d5c50f90cdd388f436	Reranking has been a focal technique in multimedia retrieval due to its efficacy in improving initial retrieval results. Current reranking methods, however, mainly rely on the heuristic weighting. In this paper, we propose a novel reranking approach called Self-Paced Reranking (SPaR) for multimodal data. As its name suggests, SPaR utilizes samples from easy to more complex ones in a self-paced fashion. SPaR is special in that it has a concise mathematical objective to optimize and useful properties that can be theoretically verified.
5834868825ff05a97b017cf3	The authors developed an extensible system for video exploitation that puts the user in control to better accommodate novel situations and source material. Visually dense displays of thumbnail imagery in storyboard views are used for shot-based video exploration and retrieval. The user can identify a need for a class of audiovisual detection, adeptly and fluently supply training material for that class, and iteratively evaluate and improve the resulting automatic classification produced via multiple modality active learning and SVM.
58ce3663c50f90cdd388f50e	The present invention is a system of integrated, computer-based processes for monolingual information development and multilingual translation. An interactive text editor enforces lexical and grammatical constraints on a natural language subset used by the authors to create their text, which they help disambiguate to ensure translatability. The resulting translatable source language text undergoes machine translation into any one of a set of target languages, without the translated text requiring any postediting.
5834868825ff05a97b0165b1	We consider the task of generating transliterated word forms. To allow for a wide range of interacting features, we use a conditional random field (CRF) sequence labeling model. We then present two innovations: a training objective that optimizes toward any of a set of possible correct labels (since more than one transliteration is often possible for a particular input), and a k-best reranking stage to incorporate nonlocal features. This paper presents results on the Arabic-English transliteration task of the NEWS 2012 workshop.
5834868825ff05a97b0173cb	Let r ≥ 3 be constant, and let Gr denote the set of r-regular graphs with vertex set V \n= {1, 2,...,n}. Let G be chosen randomly from Gr. We prove that with high probability (whp) the \ncover time of a random walk on G is asymptotic to r−1   (1 − o(1))n log n ≤ CG ≤ (1 + o(1)) \n4 27 n3.   The lower bound is achieved by (for example) the complete graph Kn, whose cover \ntime is determined by the Coupon Collector problem. In a previous paper [7] we studied the cover \ntime of random graphs Gn,p when np = c log n, where c = O(1) and (c − 1) log n → ∞.
5834868825ff05a97b0173cc	Our main tool in the proof of this theorem is a simple inequality arising from the theory of martingales. It is often referred to as Azuma's inequality. See Bollobas [2, 3] and McDiarmid [7] for surveys on its use in random graphs, probabilistic analysis of algorithms and so on, and Azuma [1] for the original result. A similar stronger inequality can be read out from Hoeffding [4]. We will use the result in the following form.
5834868825ff05a97b016520	This extended abstract addresses the optimal assignment of spatially distributed tasks to a team of heterogeneous mobile agents in domains in which tasks may be related by precedence or simultaneity constraints and have a choice of locations at which they can be performed. The manner in which constraints are satisfied and the locations chosen for tasks both impact the overall team utility. We analyze the impact of these problem features on the efficiency of the solution process.
5834868825ff05a97b016521	We address the problem of optimally assigning spatially distributed tasks to a team of heterogeneous mobile agents in domains with inter-task temporal constraints, such as precedence constraints. Due to delay penalties, satisfying the temporal constraints impacts the overall team cost. We present a mathematical model of the problem, a benchmark anytime bounded optimal solution process, and an analysis of the impact of delay penalties on problem difficulty.
5834868825ff05a97b0173d3	We consider graphs and digraphs obtained by randomly generating a prescribed number of arcs incident at each vertex. We analyse their almost certain connectivity and apply these results to the expected value of random minimum length spanning trees and arborescences. We also examine the relationship between our results and certain results of Erdős and Rnyi.
5834868825ff05a97b0173d6	Let e 1, e 2,… be a sequence of edges chosen uniformly at random from the edge set of the complete graph K n (ie, we sample with replacement). Our goal is to choose, for m as large as possible, a subset E⊆{e 1, e 2,…, e 2m},| E|= m, such that the size of the largest component in G=([n], E) is o (n)(ie, G does not contain a giant component). Furthermore, the selection process must take place on-line; that is, we must choose to accept or reject on ei based on the previously seen edges e 1,…, ei− 1.
5834868825ff05a97b0173d7	We study a random graph G n that combines certain aspects of geometric random graphs and preferential attachment graphs. This model yields a graph with power law degree distribution where the expansion property depends on a tunable parameter of the model. The vertices of G n are n sequentially generated points, x 1, x 2,..., xn, chosen uniformly at random from the unit sphere in R3 After generating xt, we randomly connect it to m points from those points x 1, x 2,..., xt− 1.
5834868825ff05a97b016527	The goal of this work is to explore the role of technology tools in enhancing the teaching and learning processes for English as a foreign or second language. Literacy is a crucial skill that is often linked to quality of life. However, access to literacy is not universal. Therefore, the significance of this research is its potential impact on the global challenge of improving child and adult literacy rates. Today's globalized world often demands strong English literacy skills for success because the language of instruction and business is frequently English.
5834868825ff05a97b0173de	An assignment of positive integer weights to the edges of a simple graph G is called irregular, if the weighted degrees of the vertices are all different. The irregularity strength, s (G), is the maximal weight, minimized over all irregular assignments. In this study, we show that s (G)≤ c 1 n/δ, for graphs with maximum degree Δ≤ n 1/2 and minimum degree δ, and s (G)≤ c 2 (log n) n/δ, for graphs with Δ> n 1/2, where c 1 and c 2 are explicit constants. To prove the result, we are using a combination of deterministic and probabilistic techniques.
5834868825ff05a97b0173df	We study the average performance of a simple greedy algorithm for finding a matching in a sparse random graph Gn, c/n, where c> 0 is constant. The algorithm was first proposed by Karp and Sipser [12]. We give significantly improved estimates of the errors made by the algorithm. For the sub-critical case where c< e we show that the algorithm finds a maximum matching with high probability. If c> e then with high probability the algorithm produces a matching which is within n1/5+ o (1) of maximum size.
5834868825ff05a97b0173e1	We consider systems where the keys for encrypting messages are derived from the pairwise intersections of sets of private keys issued to the users. We give improved bounds on the storage requirements of systems of this type for secure communication in a large network.
5834868825ff05a97b0173e3	This paper is mainly concerned with the computational complexity of determining whether or not the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into equal sized subsets so that each subset induces a particular type of graph. Many of the NP-completeness results are for planar graphs. These are proved using a planar version of 3-dimensional matching.
58cbcb90c50f90cdd3879e13	Event logs can be used effectively to improve computer system availability. Uses include retrospective and predictive diagnosis; fault management; failure rate estimation; and trend analysis. Unfortunately, much of the research to date has been hampered by the lack of suitable event data, and occasionally by the incorrect interpretation of the available data. This research uses one of the largest sets of data, and the most intensive investigation of the monitoring process conducted to date, to examine event monitoring and analysis.
5834868825ff05a97b0173e6	A restriction of the three-dimensional matching problem 3DM, in which the associated bipartite graph is planar, is shown to remain NP-complete. The restriction is inspired by that of Lichtenstein's planar 3SAT (Planar formulae and their uses, SIAM J. Comput. 11 (1982), 329–343). Like Planar 3SAT, Planar 3DM is principally a tool for use in NP-completeness proofs for planar restrictions of other problems. Several examples of its applications in this respect are given.
5834868825ff05a97b0173ea	We discuss the problem of computing the volume of a convex body K. in R*. We review worst-case results which show that it is hard to deter-ministically approximate voln K and randomised approximation algorithms which show that with randomisation one can approximate very nicely. We then provide some applications of this latter result.
5834868825ff05a97b0173eb	We prove two results concerning approximate counting of independent sets in graphs with constant maximum degree Δ. The first implies that the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is likely to fail if Δ≧6. The second shows that no fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme can exist for Δ≧25, unless RP=NP.
58ccfb6cc50f90cdd3885183	Video analysis has been attracting increasing research due to the proliferation of internet videos. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance on internet quality video analysis. Particularly, we work on the scenario of few labeled training videos being provided, which is less focused in multimedia. To being with, we consider how to more effectively harness the evidences from the low-level features. Researchers have developed several promising features to represent videos to capture the semantic information.
5834868825ff05a97b0173f4	We analyze the pure literal rule heuristic for computing a satisfying assignment to a random 3-CNF formula with n variables. We show that the pure literal rule by itself nds satisfying assignments for almost all 3-CNF formulas with up to 1: 63n clauses, but it fails for more than 1: 7n clauses. As an aside we show that the value of maximum satisability for random 3-CNF formulas is tightly concentrated around its mean.
58cd1acdc50f90cdd38861a0	The acquisition of a complex skill like writing LISP code can be decomposed into the learning of an underlying set of production rules. Each production rule appears to have a simple learning trajectory and its acquisition is independent of the acquisition of other production rules. These basic results do not appear to be dependent on the instructional modality under which one learns. Learning under a more directive modality only reduces the amount of time students spend debugging their errors.
5834868825ff05a97b0173fa	We consider the asymmetric traveling salesman problem for which the triangular inequality is satisfied. For various heuristics we construct examples to show that the worst-case ratio of length of tour found to minimum length tour is (n) for n city problems. We also provide a new O ([log 2 n]) heuristic.
5834868825ff05a97b0173fc	Polynomial-time approximation algorithms with nontrivial performance guarantees are presented for the problems of (a) partitioning the vertices of a weighted graph intok blocks so as to maximize the weight of crossing edges, and (b) partitioning the vertices of a weighted graph into two blocks of equal cardinality, again so as to maximize the weight of crossing edges. The approach, pioneered by Goemans and Williamson, is via a semidefinite programming relaxation.
58cac6a3c50f90cdd386eaf9	Architectural analysis is key to producing high quality architectures. In this demonstration we present two extensions to AcmeStudio, and domain-neutral Architecture Development Environment, to add Performance and Security Simulation. Using AcmeStudio as the integration platform for these analyses allows comparisons and trade-offs between these different quality attributes.
5834868825ff05a97b017693	This paper describes interpolation procedures for EPR. In principle, interpolation for EPR is simple: It is a special case of first-order interpolation. In practice, we would like procedures that take advantage of properties of EPR: EPR admits finite models and those models are sometimes possible to describe very compactly. Inspired by procedures for propositional logic that use models and cores, but not proofs, we develop a procedure for EPR that uses just models and cores.
58cd1e1fc50f90cdd3886368	We discuss how to apply statistical tests to compare different ACT-R models, by treating the ACT-R models as approximations of the mathematical models underlying them. To this end, we propose a method for deciding how many times to run a model, and a method for determining how many free parameters each model has.
5834868825ff05a97b017428	This paper is an attempt to make a statement about what a computer is and how it works from the perspective of physics. The single observation that computation can be a reversible process allows for the same kind of insight into computing as was obtained by Carnot's discovery that heat engines could be modeled as reversible processes. It allows us to bring computation into the realm of physics, where the power of physics allows us to ask and answer questions that seemed intractable from the viewpoint of computer science.
5834868825ff05a97b01652e	The necessary transformation of engineering education is currently the focus of many debates, primarily focused on how best to prepare engineering students to innovate effectively in a future that is increasingly global. A global future means engineers will not be able to solely depend on their personal and local experiences when designing solutions. This article presents our approach to training future engineers to succeed in this complex global future through opportunities to innovate for underserved communities.
58cc9eaac50f90cdd3881fc8	A broad view of our field is offered in A Roadmap for Sound and Music Computing. However, additional topics should be considered. The roadmap could go further by suggesting study and involvement in economic and policy analysis. Also, the roadmap does not stress the importance of tool building to support the discipline. It could be beneficial to address directly the issues of ''high''art vs. entertainment and popular culture, and the field should work to adopt both under the unifying theme of sound and music computing.
5834868825ff05a97b017a37	Finding a named person in broadcast news video is important to video retrieval. Relying on the text information such as video transcript and OCR text, this task suffers from the temporal mismatch between a person's visual appearance and his/her name occurred in text. By exploring video grammar on the concurrence pattern between faces and names, we propose an extended text-based IR method to overcome this problem and yield superior performance.
5834868825ff05a97b017a3e	A method is performed for selecting a video analysis method based on available video representation features. The method includes: determining a plurality of available video representation features for a first video output from a first video source and for a second video output from a second video source; and analyzing the plurality of video representation features as compared to at least one threshold to select one of a plurality of video analysis methods to track an object between the first and the second videos.
58cbf354c50f90cdd387b97b	The Probabilistic I/O Automata (PIOA) framework of Lynch, Segala and Vaandrager provides tools for precisely specifying protocols and reasoning about their correctness based on implementation relationships between multiple levels of abstraction. We enhance this framework to allow the analysis of protocols that use cryptographic primitives. For this purpose, we propose new techniques for handling nondeterministic behaviors, expressing computationally hardness assumptions, and for proving security in a composable setting.

5834868825ff05a97b017a4d	This paper describes 2 efficiency enhancements for speaker-independent connected spoken word spotting. The first enhancement, LESS COST, uses phoneme concatenation to reduce the cost of computing the local distance between each reference and input pattern point. The second enhancement, Coarse DP refinement, reduces the cost of dynamic time warping for only a small error rate penalty. An experiment confirmed these techniques.
5834868825ff05a97b017a51	As digital libraries grow in size, querying their contents will become as frustrating as querying the web is now. One remedy is to hierarchically cluster the results that are returned by searching a digital library. We demonstrate the clustering of search results from Carnegie Mellon's Informedia database, a large video library that supports indexing and retrieval with automatically generated descriptors.
58cca18fc50f90cdd388215e	Nyquist is a programming language for sound synthesis and music composition. Nyquist has evolved from a text-only programming language to include an integrated development environment (IDE) that adds graphical support for many tasks. Nyquist is also hosted by Audacity, a widely used audio editor that can invoke Nyquist functions written in the form of scripted plug-ins. This article shows by example how task-oriented interface design can augment a text-based language.
58ce9605c50f90cdd3892755	The following report describes the work at the interAct on Bulgarian speech recognition, including the collection of data, training a Bulgarian speech recognizer and experimenting with Russian text data to improve the recognition. It also gives an overview of the unique traits of Bulgarian language, introduces the main issues of speech recognition, and presents the results.

58cea079c50f90cdd3892cb0	Neural models have recently shown big improvements in the performance of phrase-based machine translation. Recurrent language models, in particular, have been a great success due to their ability to model arbitrary long context. In this work, we integrate global semantic information extracted from large encyclopedic sources into neural network language models. We integrate semantic word classes extracted from Wikipedia and sentence level topic information into a recurrent neural network-based language model.
5834868825ff05a97b017927	In this paper, we describe a complete system for mission planning and execution for multiple robots in natural terrain. We report on experiments with a system for autonomously driving two vehicles based on complex mission specifications. We show that the system is able to plan local paths in obstacle fields based on sensor data, to plan and update global paths to goals based on frequent obstacle map updates, and to modify mission execution, eg, the assignment and ordering of the goals, based on the updated paths to the goals.

Major challenges in surface electromyography based speech recognition ensue from repositioning electrodes between recording sessions, environmental temperature changes, and skin tissue properties of the speaker. In order to reduce the impact of these factors, we investigate...
5834868825ff05a97b01669c	Presents an approach to efficient multirobot mapping and exploration which exploits a market architecture in order to maximize information gain while minimizing incurred costs. This system is reliable and robust in that it can accommodate dynamic introduction and loss of team members in addition to being able to withstand communication interruptions and failures. Results showing the capabilities of our system on a team of exploring autonomous robots are given.
5834868825ff05a97b017959	This paper discusses some representation issues and challenges involved in object recognition. It is intended as a step toward assessing current object representation schemes and proposing design and evaluation criteria for future ones. The presentation is based on position statements by panelists at the 1994 IEEE Workshop on CAD-Based Vision and the 1994 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.
5834868825ff05a97b017a7c	The Informedia digital video library has been on the forefront of automatic analysis of video streams, as well as pioneering interactive display and retrieval mechanisms for video data through various multimedia surrogates including titles, storyboards, and skims [1, 5]. This demonstration will highlight the use of Informedia processing and interfaces in the context of the TREC Video Retrieval Track, whose high-level goal is the investigation of content-based retrieval from digital video [4].
5834868825ff05a97b017a86	Multimedia event detection (MED) is an effective technique for video indexing and retrieval. Current classifier training for MED treats the negative videos equally. However, many negative videos may resemble the positive videos in different degrees. Intuitively, we may capture more informative cues from the negative videos if we assign them fine-grained labels, thus benefiting the classifier learning. Aiming for this, we use a statistical method on both the positive and negative examples to get the decisive attributes of a specific event.

58cca736c50f90cdd3882485	This report explores the question of compatibility between annotation projects including translating annotation formalisms to each other or to common forms. Compatibility issues are crucial for systems that use the results of multiple annotation projects. We hope that this report will begin a concerted effort in the field to track the compatibility of annotation schemes for part of speech tagging, time annotation, treebanking, role labeling and other phenomena.
5834868825ff05a97b017962	The valid time of a fact is the time when the fact is true in the modeled reality. Any subset of the time domain may be associated with a fact. Thus, valid timestamps may be sets of time instants and time intervals, with single instants and intervals being important special cases. Valid times are usually supplied by the user.
5834868825ff05a97b017964	The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in the construction and analysis of Web Scale multimedia datasets and resources. The Workshop will provide a forum to consolidate key factors related to research on very large scale multimedia dataset such as the construction of dataset, creation of ground truth, sharing and extension of such resources in terms of ground truth, features, algorithms and tools etc. The Workshop will discuss and formulate action plan towards these goals.
5834868825ff05a97b01796b	This article summarizes the outcome of the 2012 Shonan Meeting “Future of Multimedia Analysis and Mining.” The meeting was really interesting, and the participants had a fun time with an Kamakura excursion and fine dinners, in addition to in-depth discussions on ready-to-go hot research topics (see Figure 4). We have enjoyed sharing even part of our experiences with readers here.
5834868825ff05a97b017985	We introduce an interface for efficient video search that exploits the human ability to quickly scan visual content, after an automatic system has done its best to arrange the images in order of relevance. While extreme video retrieval is taxing to the human, it has also been shown to be very effective. The system will demonstrate several ways to rapidly scan images, change search queries, and employ different types of relevance feedback.
5834868825ff05a97b017999	The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of gestures to manipulate graphic objects. The knowledge about how people intuitively use gestures to communicate with computers will be beneficial in future development of gesture based input devices.

The circuit and its correctness conditions are formalized as a set of algebraic relations on the real numbers. The main obstacle to applying theorem proving techniques for hardware verification is the need for detailed user guidance of proofs. We overcome the need for detailed proof guidance in...
58cca77dc50f90cdd38824ae	For several years we have been conducting Accuracy Based Evaluations (ABE) of the JANUS speech-to-speech MT system (Gates et al., 1997) which measure quality and fidelity of translation. Recently we have begun to design a Task Based Evaluation for JANUS (Thomas, 1999) which measures goal completion. This paper describes what we have learned by comparing the two types of evaluation. Both evaluations (ABE and TBE) were conducted on a common set of user studies in the semantic domain of travel planning.
5834868825ff05a97b017b3f	We present a novel method for obstacle detection for automated highway environments. Laser range scanners have frequently been used for obstacle detection for mobile robots. Although most laser scanners provide intensity information in addition to range, laser intensity has been ignored by most researchers. We show that laser intensity, on its own, is sufficient (and better) for detecting obstacles at long ranges in mild terrain such as an automated highway.

58cbfcd4c50f90cdd387bfc4	Thermocapillary effect is widely used in microfluidic applications for sensing and actuation [1-4]. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that thermocapillary effect can also be used to generate rigid-body motion [5]. Furthermore, it is possible to cast Marangoni flows to achieve controllable rigid-body motion in 3D space. To this effect, here we present the basics of a simulation technique to analyze 6-dof time-dependent rigid-body motion of such a microswimmer actuated with Marangoni effect.
5834868825ff05a97b017bd7	Evolutionary change in morphological features must depend on architectural reorganization of developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs), just as true conservation of morphological features must imply retention of ancestral developmental GRN features. Key elements of the provisional GRN for embryonic endomesoderm development in the sea urchin are here compared with those operating in embryos of a distantly related echinoderm, a starfish. These animals diverged from their common ancestor 520-480 million years ago.
5834868825ff05a97b017c33	Prior research has shown that customer-reported software faults are often the result of violated dependencies that are not recognized by developers implementing software. Many types of dependencies and corresponding measures have been proposed to help address this problem. The objective of this research is to compare the relative performance of several of these dependency measures as they relate to customer-reported defects. Our analysis is based on data collected from two projects from two independent companies.
5834868825ff05a97b017c6c	In this paper, we present a framework for estimating what portions of videos are most discriminative for the task of action recognition. We explore the impact of the temporal cropping of training videos on the overall accuracy of an action recognition system, and we formalize what makes a set of croppings optimal. In addition, we present an algorithm to determine the best set of croppings for a dataset, and experimentally show that our approach increases the accuracy of various state-of-the-art action recognition techniques.
5834868825ff05a97b017c89	We present a comparison of an extended Kalman filter and an adaptation of bundle adjustment from computer vision for mobile robot localization and mapping using a bearing-only sensor. We show results on synthetic and real examples and discuss some advantages and disadvantages of the techniques. The comparison leads to a novel combination of the two techniques which results in computational complexity near Kalman filters and performance near bundle adjustment on the examples shown.
58cc22b0c50f90cdd387d9a7	Computational offloading services at the edge of the Internet for mobile devices are becoming a reality.

5834868825ff05a97b015f59	We consider the problem of improving named entity recognition (NER) systems by using external dictionaries---more specifically, the problem of extending state-of-the-art NER systems by incorporating information about the similarity of extracted entities to entities in an external dictionary. This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name; however, the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names.
58ccac35c50f90cdd3882742	JANUS-II is a research system to design and test components of speech-to-speech translation systems as well as a research prototype for such a system. We focus on two aspects of the system:(1) the new features of the speech recognition component JANUS-SR, and (2) the end-to-end performance of JANUS-II, including a comparison of two machine translation strategies used for JANUS-MT (PHOENIX and GLR*).
5834868825ff05a97b015f5c	A program that makes an existing website look like a database is called a wrapper. Wrapper learning is the problem of learning website wrappers from examples. We present a wrapper-learning system called WL 2 that can exploit several different representations of a document. Examples of such different representations include DOM-level and token-level representations, as well as two-dimensional geometric views of the rendered page (for tabular data) and representations of the visual appearance of text asm it will be rendered.
58ccad81c50f90cdd38827f4	We report on techniques for using discourse context to reduce ambiguity and improve translation accuracy in a multi-lingual (Spanish, German, and English) spoken language translation system. The techniques involve statistical models as well as knowledge-based models including discourse plan inference. This work is carried out in the context of the Janus project at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Karlsruhe.
58ccb019c50f90cdd388295c	We describe the scopes of two schools in lexical semantics, which we call syntax-driven lexical semantics and ontology-driven lexical semantics, respectively. Both approaches are used in various applications at The Center for Machine Translation. We believe that a comparative analysis of these positions and clarification of claims and coverage is essential for the field as a whole.
5834868825ff05a97b017c0e	Open source software systems are important components of many business software applications. Field defect predictions for open source software systems may allow organizations to make informed decisions regarding open source software components. In this paper, we remotely measure and analyze predictors (metrics available before release) mined from established data sources (the code repository and the request tracking system) as well as a novel source of data (mailing list archives) for nine releases of OpenBSD.
58ccb438c50f90cdd3882b88	• The ambiguities in stereo correspondence can be resolved with contextual information through interactions between disparity-tuned neurons.• Our previous work (Samonds et al., 2009, 2013) showed competitive/cooperative interactions among disparity-tuned neurons that are consistent with constraints in Marr & Poggio (1976)'s and other widely used MRF-based models.

58c86cc8c50f90cdd3857206	Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) generate a wealth of finegrained student interaction data. Although it seems likely that teachers could benefit from access to advanced analytics generated from these data, ITSs do not typically come with dashboards designed for teachers' needs. In this project, we follow a user-centered design approach to create a dashboard for teachers using ITSs.
58c87214c50f90cdd3857526	Extracting speaker sentiment from natural audio streams such as YouTube is challenging.

58c87627c50f90cdd38577a3	We present an algorithm to find a low-dimensional decomposition of a spectrogram by formulating this as a regularized non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem with a regularization term chosen to encourage independence. This algorithm provides a better decomposition than standard NMF when the underlying sources are independent. It is directly applicable to non-square matrices, and it makes better use of additional observation streams than previous nonnegative ICA algorithms.
5834868825ff05a97b017a2b	Multimedia event detection (MED) is a retrieval task with the goal of finding videos of a particular event in a large scale internet video archive, given example videos and text descriptions. Nowadays, different multimodal fusion schemes of low-level and high-level features are extensively investigated and evaluated for MED. For most of events in MED, people are usually the central subjects in videos. The face of a person can be considered as the most important factor which brings a lot of information describing the video events.
58c87796c50f90cdd3857883	A method and system recognizes an unknown speaker by directing an ultrasonic signal at a face of the unknown speaker. A Doppler signal of the ultrasonic signal is acquired after reflection by the face, and Doppler features are extracted from the reflected Doppler signal. The Doppler features are classified using Doppler models storing the Doppler features and identities of known speakers to recognize and identify the unknown speaker.

58cb6489c50f90cdd387561f	Medical device or instrument for diagnosing pressure ulcers using optical reflectance spectroscopy. The device may comprise a tip and a controller. The tip is pressed against the skin of the patient and collects the optical reflectance data. The controller processes the data to determine whether there exists a pressure ulcer and, if there is one, its depth. The tip may also include a pressure sensor for sensing the pressure at which the tip is applied to the patient's skin.
58cb698cc50f90cdd38759a6	Locating the patient accurately in real-time is necessary for many problems in medical robotics. Current solutions are expensive or inconvenient. We show progress toward solving these problems by using ultrasound to track CT reference features in real-time. We compute the locations of target features in the ultrasonic images relative to the CT reference features.
58cb8f36c50f90cdd3877375	Transferring knowledge across a sequence of related tasks is an important challenge in reinforcement learning. Despite much encouraging empirical evidence that shows benefits of transfer, there has been very little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we study a class of lifelong reinforcementlearning problems: the agent solves a sequence of tasks modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), each of which is from a finite set of MDPs with the same state/action spaces and different transition/reward functions.
58cbf54ec50f90cdd387badf	The Probabilistic I/O Automata framework of Lynch, Segala and Vaandrager provides tools for precisely specifying protocols and reasoning about their correctness using multiple levels of abstraction, based on implementation relationships between these levels. We enhance this framework to allow analyzing protocols that use cryptographic primitives. This requires resolving and reconciling issues such as nondeterministic behavior and scheduling, randomness, resource-bounded computation, and computational hardness assumptions.
58cc0951c50f90cdd387c842	Agent Based Modeling studies group activity by simulating the individuals in it and allowing group-level phenomena to emerge. It can be used to integrate theories to inform designs of technology for groups. Researchers use theories as the basis of the rules of how individuals behave (eg, what motivates users to contribute to an online community). They can run virtual experiments by changing parameters of the model (eg, the topical focus in an online community) to see what collective behaviors emerge.
58cc402ac50f90cdd387ee4c	Much robotics research has focused on intent-expressive (legible) motion. However, algorithms that can autonomously generate legible motion have implicitly made the strong assumption of an omniscient observer, with access to the robot's configuration as it changes across time. In reality, human observers have a particular viewpoint, which biases the way they perceive the motion. In this work, we free robots from this assumption and introduce the notion of an observer with a specific point of view into legibility optimization.
5834868825ff05a97b015f77	Our research focuses on developing interactive technologies for a broad range of end-user programming activities, including code construction, verification, debugging, and understanding.

5834868825ff05a97b01742f	Historical note. The present paper constitutes the “Project Description” section of a one-year proposal submitted to DARPA in November 1978 and funded shortly thereafter. Though never formally published, this DARPA proposal was widely circulated and played a seminal role; specifically, it originated the concepts of “ballistic computation” and “virtually nondissipative computation”. As interest in low-power circuitry grows, the techniques presented here are being rediscovered, extended, and utilized.
5834868825ff05a97b0176a8	We describe PTYASM, an enhanced version of the YASM software model checker which uses proof templates. These templates associate correctness arguments with common programming idioms, thus enabling efficient verification. We have used PTYASM to verify the safety of array accesses in programs derived from the Verisec suite. PTYASM is able to verify this property in the majority of testcases, while existing software model checkers fail to do so due to loop unrolling.
5834868825ff05a97b016532	We study eye gaze movement behavior during paper reading and generate a series of annotations from a user's reading features: gray shading to indicate reading speed, borders to indicate frequency of re-reading, and lines to indicate transitions between sections of a document. Through a user study, we validate that our SocialReading system that shares teachers' gaze data for an academic paper can improve students' reading comprehension of that paper.
5834868825ff05a97b017431	The purpose of the BBN time-sharing system is to increase the effectiveness of the PDP-1 computer for those applications involving manmachine interaction by allowing each of the five users, each at his own typewriter to interact with the computer just as if he had a computer all to himself. The effectiveness of this interaction is further enhanced by the use of the TYC language for controlling the operation and modification of programs.
5834868825ff05a97b015eb6	To study affect regulation in adults with unipolar (n= 38) and bipolar (n= 38) forms of childhood-onset depression (COD), as compared with adults with no history of psychiatric illness (n= 60), we examined affective modulation of the startle eyeblink reflex. Participants were subjected to binaural bursts of white noise while viewing pictures designed to elicit pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant affective states. The blink response was recorded from surface electrodes over the orbicularis oculi muscle during and following pictures.
5834868825ff05a97b0176b3	Studies of safety-critical software-reliant systems developed using the current practices of build-then-test show that requirements and architecture design defects make up approximately 70% of all defects, many system level related to operational quality attributes, and 80% of these defects are discovered late in the development life cycle [Redman 2010]. Exponential growth in software size and complexity has pushed the cost for the current generation of aircraft to the limit of affordability.

W/Aura supports audio, MIDI, and user-interface processing, with priority-based scheduling; it has the practical virtues of exibility, portability, and speed. We describe the current implementation, discuss its performance, and describe future plans.
5834868825ff05a97b0166c3	Current software suites suffer from problems due to poor integration of their individual tools. They require the designer to think of all possible integrating behaviours and leave littIe flexibility to the user. CyberDesk is a component so&are fiamework that automatically integrates desktop and network services, reducing integrating decisions to be made by the tool designers and giving more control to the user. Simple extensions to CyberDesk have been made to obtain powerful integrating behaviours.

5834868825ff05a97b017a5e	We are developing a classifier that can automatically identify a web video's ideological perspective on a political or social issue (eg, pro-life or pro-choice on the abortion issue). The problem has received little attention, possibly due to inherent difficulties in content-based approaches. We propose to develop such a classifier based on the pattern of tags emerging from folksonomies. The experimental results are positive and encouraging.
5834868825ff05a97b017477	The identification of the referents of pronouns and definite descriptions in natural language processing (NLP) is a formidable task. We present our approach to pronominal and definite references in a German language dialogue system that is currently being implemented. This approach combines immediate focus and a special purpose reasoner that uses a KL-ONE like taxonomy within a modified form of discourse representation theory (DRT) structure (KAMP 81, HUNZE 88).
5834868825ff05a97b0176f2	Model-checking gained wide popularity for analyzing software and hardware systems. However, even when the desired property holds, the property or the model may still require fixing. For example, a property ϕ:“on all paths, a request is followed by an acknowledgment”, may hold because no requests have been generated. Vacuity detection has been proposed to address the above problem. This technique is able to determine that the above property ϕ is satisfied vacuously in systems where requests are never sent.

The resulting hierarchy can be used for clustering and prediction.
58cb6317c50f90cdd3875516	A texture characterization method has been explored to model the visual appearance of painting before and after a surface treatment. A preliminary experiment has been conducted to test the texture feature vectors before and after varnishing with Grumbacher's Picture Varnish liquid. Numerical functions, such as level of harmony (Energy) and level of disorder (Entropy) are computed. The results show that both functions are sensitive to the effect of varnishing. Energy function is the most sensitive measurement.

5834868825ff05a97b0165e2	We describe a new dependency parser for English tweets, TWEEBOPARSER. The parser builds on several contributions: new syntactic annotations for a corpus of tweets (TWEEBANK), with conventions informed by the domain; adaptations to a statistical parsing algorithm; and a new approach to exploiting out-of-domain Penn Treebank data. Our experiments show that the parser achieves over 80% unlabeled attachment accuracy on our new, high-quality test set and measure the benefit of our contributions.
58ce6fc8c50f90cdd3891365	We describe a theoretical model of spatial representation in cortex, including computer simulations, that is compatible with data from single neuron recordings. Our proposed architecture, called a sinusoidal array, encodes a polar vector 5=(r, b) as distributed activity across a neuronal population. We demonstrate how sinusoidal arrays might be used for vec-tor computations such as addition, subtraction, and rotation in tasks such as primate reaching and rodent navigation.

58cbdf7ac50f90cdd387abdf	We use computational modeling and formal analysis techniques to study temporal behavior of a discrete logical model of the naïve T cell differentiation. The model is analyzed formally and automatically by performing temporal logic queries via statistical model checking. While the model can be verified and then further explored using Monte Carlo simulations, model checking allows for much more efficient analysis by testing a large set of system properties, with much smaller runtime than the one required by simulations.
58ccdfccc50f90cdd3884266	A system and method reduces noise in a time series signal. A primary signal including stationary and non-stationary noise is modeled by a dynamic system having a continuum of states. A secondary signal including time series data is added to the primary signal to form a combined signal. The generic noise in the combined signal is estimated from samples of the combined signal using the dynamic system modeling the generic noise. Then, the estimated generic noise is removed from the combined signal to recover time series data.
58ccdc42c50f90cdd3884069	Audio editing software allows multi-track recordings to be manipulated by moving notes, correcting pitch, and making other fine adjustments, but this is a tedious process. An “intelligent audio editor” uses a machine-readable score as a specification for the desired performance and automatically makes adjustments to note pitch, timing, and dynamic level.
58ccdfe4c50f90cdd3884274	A network of personal computers may contain a large amount of distributed computing resources. For a number of reasons it is desirable to share these resources, but sharing is complicated by issues of security and autonomy. A process known as the Butler addresses these problems and provides support for resource sharing. The Butler relies upon a capability-based accounting system called the Banker to monitor the use of local resources.
58ccdc95c50f90cdd3884096	A set of techniques have been developed and refined to support the demanding software requirements of combined interactive computer music and computer animation. The techniques include a new programming environment that supports an integration of procedural and declarative score‐like descriptions of interactive real‐time behavior. Also discussed are issues of asynchronous input, concurrency, memory management, scheduling, and testing. Two examples are described.
5834868825ff05a97b01674a	We present a novel mechanical system, the “landfish,” which takes advantage of a combination of articulation and a nonholonomic constraint to exhibit fishlike locomotion. We apply geometric mechanics techniques to establish the equations of motion in terms of the system's nonholonomic momentum and analyze the system's equilibrium properties. Finally, we demonstrate its locomotion capabilities under several controllers, including heading and joint velocity control.
58ccdcc8c50f90cdd38840b3	The Multi Modal Communication tool was developed to improve mission effectiveness for Command and Control operators. This communication management suite combines mature communication technology to provide the operator with an intuitive display that allows on-demand access to mission critical communication data.
58cc6f9cc50f90cdd3880707	This paper proposes a statistical mapping-based technique for guessing pronunciations of novel words from their spellings. The technique is based on the automatic determination and utilization of unidirectional mappings between n-tuples of characters and n-tuples of phonemes, and may be viewed as a statistical extension of analogy-based pronunciation guessing algorithms.
58cc7085c50f90cdd388078a	Systems, methods, and computer program products to detect a keyword in speech, by generating, from a sequence of spectral feature vectors generated from the speech, a plurality of blocked feature vector sequences, and analyzing, by a neural network, each of the plurality of blocked feature vector sequences to detect the presence of the keyword in the speech.
58cc8c88c50f90cdd3881655	This paper describes the annotation process being used in a multi-site project to create six sizable bilingual parallel corpora annotated with a consistent interlingua representation. After presenting the background and objectives of the effort, we describe the multilingual corpora and the three stages of interlingual representation being developed. We then focus on the annotation process itself, including an interface environment that supports the annotation task, and the methodology for evaluating the interlingua representation.
58ce721bc50f90cdd38914a6	We describe a parallel mapping matrix that performs several types of sequence manipulations that are the building blocks of well-known phonological processes. Our results indicate that human phonological behavior can by modeled by a highly constrained connectionist architecture, one that uses purely feedforward circuitry and imposes tight limits on depth of derivations.
5834868825ff05a97b01661f	Many interesting real world domains involve reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. Efficient learning in such domains is important, but existing sample complexity bounds for partially observable RL are at least exponential in the episode length. We give, to our knowledge, the first partially observable RL algorithm with a polynomial bound on the number of episodes on which the algorithm may not achieve near-optimal performance. Our algorithm is suitable for an important class of episodic POMDPs.
58ce765ac50f90cdd38916f0	Tekkotsu has grown from a specialized framework for development on the Sony Aibo to a general purpose robotics development environment with support for a variety of hardware, algorithms for autonomous operation, virtual simulation, and associated curriculum for undergraduate education. This paper describes the implementation of these features, provides examples of their use in research and education, and draws a comparison with other popular open-source robotics frameworks.
58ce7674c50f90cdd38916ff	Animal navigation can be simultaneously studied externally, at the level of actions in the world, and internally, at the level of individual neuron firings. In this paper we describe a computational theory of rodent navigation that is constrained by data at both these levels. We report results of computer simulations of a split landmark array task that lead to interesting predictions about the behavior of hippocampal place cells.
5834868825ff05a97b017950	Determining the motion consistency between two video clips is a key component for many applications such as video event detection and human pose estimation. Shechtman and Irani recently proposed a method for measuring the motion consistency between two videos by representing the motion about each point with a space-time Harris matrix of spatial and temporal derivatives. A motion-consistency measure can be accurately estimated without explicitly calculating the optical flow from the videos, which could be noisy.
5834868825ff05a97b0179f0	We describe an approach to mobility planning for autonomous navigation of multiple vehicles in unstructured environments. At the lowest level, this approach uses command arbitration in order to combine command recommendation from driving behaviors. Driving behaviors include local behaviors such as obstacle avoidance or goal tracking, and strategic behavior such as route planning to distant goals. Obstacle avoidance is performed by evaluating a fixed command set with respect to a terrain map built from 3D sensors.
5834868825ff05a97b01795c	We are developing a classifier that can automatically identify a web video's ideological perspective on a political or social issue (eg, pro-life or pro-choice on the abortion issue). The problem has received little attention, possibly due to inherent difficulties in content-based approaches. We propose to develop such a classifier based on the pattern of tags emerging from folksonomies. The experimental results are positive and encouraging.
58ce73ccc50f90cdd389158c	Acquiring phonological rules is hard, especially when they do not describe generalizations that hold for all surface forms. We believe it can be made easier by adopting a more cognitively natural architecture for phonological processing. We briefly review the structure of M3P, our connectionist Many Maps Model of Phonology, in which extrinsic rule ordering is virtually eliminated, and iterative processes are handled by a parallel clustering mechanism. We then describe a program for inducing phonological rules from examples.
58ce7713c50f90cdd3891752	We present a new energy harvesting technology that generates electrical energy from a user's interactions with paper-like materials. The energy harvesters are flexible, light, and inexpensive, and they utilize a user's gestures such as tapping, touching, rubbing and sliding to generate electrical energy. The harvested energy is then used to actuate LEDs, e-paper displays and various other devices to create novel interactive applications, such as enhancing books and other printed media with interactivity.
58ce7764c50f90cdd3891781	We have developed a computational theory of rodent navigation that includes analogs of the place cell system, the head direction system, and path integration. In this paper we present simulation results showing how interactions between the place and head direction systems can account for recent observations about hippocampal place cell responses to doubling and/or rotation of cue cards in a cylindrical arena (Sharp et at., 1990). Rodents have multiple internal representations of their relationship to their environment.
5834868825ff05a97b0165b2	We show that it is possible to learn to identify, with high accuracy, the native language of English test takers from the content of the essays they write. Our method uses standard text classification techniques based on multiclass logistic regression, combining individually weak indicators to predict the most probable native language from a set of 11 possibilities. We describe the various features used for classification, as well as the settings of the classifier that yielded the highest accuracy.
58cd717ac50f90cdd3888e24	Renal transplantation program in the Armed Forces commenced in Feb 1991 and till date 245 patients have undergone renal transplantation at INHS Asvini. We describe our protocols for donor and recipient evaluation and immunosuppression. Methods: 245 patients received renal transplants during this period, 243 (99.2%) being from live donors. Most of them were started on triple immunosuppression comprising...
58c916c7c50f90cdd385d752	Creating facial animations that convey an animator's intent is a difficult task because animation techniques are necessarily an approximation of the subtle motion of the face. Some animation techniques may result in linearization of the motion of vertices in space (blendshapes, for example), and other, simpler techniques may result in linearization of the motion in time. In this article, we consider the problem of animating smiles and explore how these simplifications in space and time affect the perceived genuineness of smiles.
58cca404c50f90cdd38822b7	An interlingua is a representation of meaning or speaker intention that is neutral between the various ways that the meaning can be expressed. The examples in (1) show that the same meaning can be expressed by different syntactic means in different languages, and even within one language.
5834868825ff05a97b017ac1	There is abundant evidence that software development in general is an inherently collaborative activity, with much time invested in communication [eg, Perry et al, 1994]. Design activities seem to be particularly collaborative in commercial development. In fact, evidence suggests that more than half the design effort is spent in group work, a proportion much higher than other development activities (see Figure 1).
5834868825ff05a97b015fc5	We significantly reduce the complexity of BDD-based symbolic verification by using partitioned transition relations to represent state transition graphs. On an example pipeline circuit, this technique reduced the verification time by an order of magnitude and the storage requirements for the transition relation by two orders of magnitude. We were also able to handle example pipelines with over 10120 reachable states.
5834868825ff05a97b0168d7	The problem examined in this report is the calculation of the average wasted space at the end of the block when variable length records are inserted in the file. Previous efforts are based in approximations. Here, a detailed analysis based on Markov chains gives the exact solution. A framework is presented which shows the relations between the previous approaches. The proposed model includes the previous models as special limiting cases. Simulation results close to the analytic results are also presented.
58cca444c50f90cdd38822da	By adopting a “first-things-first” approach we overcome a number of challenges inherent in developing NLP Systems for resource-scarce languages. By first gathering the necessary corpora and lexicons we are then enabled to build, for Mapudungun, a spelling-corrector, morphological analyzer, and two Mapudungun-Spanish machine translation systems; and for Quechua, a morphological analyzer as well as a rule-based Quechua-Spanish machine translation system.
5834868825ff05a97b0168e9	A blog service company provides a function named BlogCast that exposes quality posts on the blog main page to vitalize a blogosphere. This paper analyzes a new type of information diffusion via BlogCast. We show that there exists a strong halo effect in a blogosphere via thorough investigation on a huge volume of blog data.
58cc9ae6c50f90cdd3881dc4	Debugging a constraint-based graphical system can be difficult because critical interdependencies can be hard to visualize or even discover. The debugging tools for Garnet provide many convenient ways to inspect objects and constraints in Garnet-based systems.
58ccdb05c50f90cdd3883fb7	A MIDI-based conducting program was implemented to allow a conductor to control lhe tempo of a MIDI performance that accompanies a live performer. The tempo is controlled by tapping beats on a keyboard. A number of features were added in the process of preparing tor a large-scale performance, a concerto for live piano and MIDI orchestra and. chorus. This experience led to a number of practical suggestions.
5834868825ff05a97b01675c	This paper focuses on the long-term retention and production of vocabulary in an intensive English program (IEP). The study compares the learning of words through a computer assisted learning program with an'ecological'control of standard classroom practice. The study seeks to elucidiate the strengths of both approaches. The paper draws on the practical framework of Coxhead (2001) and Nation (2005) and the theoretical perspectives of Laufer & Hulstijn (2001). The project collected data from two separate classes of ESL learners.
58cce041c50f90cdd38842ab	This paper aims to develop a system for estimating a vehicle's speed by analyzing its drive by acoustics with a passive audio microphone. Analysis of the vehicle's acoustics would primarily use the phenomenon of Doppler shift, and the instant at which vehicle is at closest-point-of approach. This approach uses a technique called Seam carving to track harmonics formed by vehicle particularly its engine noise. The method proposed is computationally inexpensive and can very easily be developed into mobile application.
58ccdea3c50f90cdd38841bf	A series of thiosemicarbazones (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7) have been synthesized by treating thiosemicarbazide with different substituted aromatic aldehydes and then these compounds were further treated with acetic anhydrides to obtain acylated compounds (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 and D1, D2) respectively. The structures of the compounds were characterized on the basis of their IR and 1H-NMR data. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal and locomotor activity.
5834868825ff05a97b017ad0	This paper discusses the value of software instrumentation in architecting the runtime behavior of complex, sociotechnical ecosystems. Our solution is targeted at gathering metrics from scientific software communities in order to better understand them. We hope that by gathering information, such as usage frequency, operating systems in use, and execution time, that we can provide a valuable tool that helps administrators in complex decision-making regarding the potential evolutionary tracks for the community.
58cd8b98c50f90cdd3889bb2	Background: Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. The doctors are vulnerable to substance abuse due to their ready accessibility to the substance of abuse. Timely detection of substance abuse may help timely intervention and control of the social problems. The present study undertaken with the objectives to estimate prevalence of substance abuse and to find out some socio economic factors those may be associated to substance abuse.
5834868825ff05a97b015fca	This paper presents a model checking tool, SatAbs, that implements a predicate abstraction refinement loop. Existing software verification tools such as Slam, Blast, or Magic use decision procedures for abstraction and simulation that are limited to integers. SatAbs overcomes these limitations by using a SAT-solver. This allows the model checker to handle the semantics of the ANSI-C standard accurately. This includes a sound treatment of bit-vector overflow, and of the ANSI-C pointer arithmetic constructs.
5834868825ff05a97b017ad2	Software is increasingly important to the scientific enterprise, and science-funding agencies are increasingly funding software work. Accordingly, many different participants need insight into how to understand the relationship between software, its development, its use, and its scientific impact. In this article, we draw on interviews and participant observation to describe the information needs of domain scientists, software component producers, infrastructure providers, and ecosystem stewards, including science funders.
58cd8faac50f90cdd3889dd2	In this Letter, a novel approach is used for improving the Bit Error Rate (BER) for non-stationary environment based spectrum sensing. Here, we have considered Converged Welch's Power Spectral Density (PSD) for analyzing of power. The signal of interest is thus further studied in terms of BER keeping the antenna and channel parameters constant. The proposed method yields an improvement of 34.6% as compared with the conventional method.
5834868825ff05a97b016921	An auditing framework for determining whether a database disclosure of information adhered to its data disclosure policies. Users formulate audit expressions to specify the (sensitive) data subject to disclosure review. An audit component accepts audit expressions and returns all queries (deemed “suspicious”) that accessed the specified data during their execution.
5834868825ff05a97b015fcd	We significantly reduce the complexity of BDD-based symbolic verification by using partitioned transition relations to represent state transition graphs. This method can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous circuits. The times necessary to verify a synchronous pipeline and an asynchronous stack are both bounded by a low polynomial in the size of the circuit. We were able to handle stacks with over IO50 reachable states and pipelines with over 10120 reachable states.
58cca48ac50f90cdd3882303	Automated identification of tasks in email messages can be very useful to busy email users. What constitutes a task varies across individuals and must be learned for each user. However, training data for this purpose tends to be scarce. This paper addresses the lack of training data using domain-specific semantic features in document representation for reducing vocabulary mismatches and enhancing the discriminative power of trained classifiers when the number of training examples is relatively small.
58cd940ec50f90cdd388a030	Equisetaceae a unigeneric family with only one extant genus. Equiseturn L. having fifteen species and seventeen hybrids in the world, is represented by six species and one interspecific hybrid in India. The present treatment of the family provides historical notes, key from subgeneric to species level, general morphology of the taxa, their type citation, world and Indian distribution, discussion and notes on anatomy, cytology, gametophyte, micromorphology, ecology, chemistry and uses.
58cdade6c50f90cdd388ad76	A dual-node split-gate silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon cell with a novel read scheme is proposed for 2-bit/cell operation. Using suitable gate screening bias in reverse read, bit coupling can be reduced, even when low read VD is used to keep read disturb under control. The proposed read scheme maintains the memory window for dual-bit/cell operation for deeply scaled cells. Two-dimensional process, device, and Monte Carlo simulations are extensively used to design and understand cell operation.
58cdaee2c50f90cdd388adf9	Tarjan has given an algorithm for deciding isomorphism of two groups of order n (given as multiplication tables) which _,(log2n+ 0 (l),,., _ „,, runs in 0 (n) steps where n is the order of the groups. Tarjan uses the fact that a group of n is generated by log n elements. In this paper, we show that Tarjan's technique generalizes to isomorphism of quasigroups, latin squares, Steiner systems, and many graphs generated from these combinatorial objects.
58cdd191c50f90cdd388bff4	This paper includes polynomial time isomorphism tests and canonical forms for graphs called k-contractable graphs for fixed k. The class of k-contractable graphs includes the graphs of bounded valertce and the graphs of bounded genus. The algorithm uses several new ideas including:(1) it removes portions of the graph and replaces them with groups which are used to keep track of the symmetries of these portions;[2} it maintains with each group a tower of equivalence relation which allows a decomposition of the group.
5834868825ff05a97b015fd1	This paper describes a new symbolic model checker, called NuSMV, developed as part of a joint project between CMU and IRST. NuSMV is the result of the reengineering, reimplementation and, to a limited extent, extension of the CMU SMV model checker. The core of this paper consists of a detailed description of the NuSMV functionalities, architecture, and implementation.
58cdd41dc50f90cdd388c157	The classical meshing problem is to construct a triangulation of a region that conforms to the boundary, is as coarse as possible, and is constructed from simplices having bounded aspect ratio. In this paper we present a fully incremental Delaunay reﬁnement algorithm. The algorithm is an extension of one introduced by Ruppert. The algorithm is fully incremental in the sense that it does not need any preprocessing to ﬁnd an initial Delaunay triangulation or an initial reﬁnement to reﬁne away all encroached simplices of input faces.

ROVER II was designed in-house as a general purpose guide path following mobile platform for material handling and transportation within a manufacturing facility.
5834868825ff05a97b016770	Scaling of folded electrothermal actuators for optical applications in arrays from 1 mm to 50 µm pitch is presented. A 1-D model of a folded electrothermal actuator is presented to demonstrate the inverse scaling law for power with array pitch and linear scaling for rotational scan range. Metal/oxide bimorph actuators with discrete heaters are shown to have up to 26% higher thermal sensitivity than metal/oxide/polySi multimorphs with distributed heating.
58cfeb48c50f90cdd389da0d	Adrian stated that they are engineers trying to solve hard problems and to fix things when they break. We all want perfect code on perfect hardware. But perfection takes too long, utopia is slightly out of reach. So they compromise, focusing on time-tomarket instead of quality. At Netflix, they need to move fast so they can disrupt their competitors' OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act).

5834868825ff05a97b015f9b	We describe the open-source tool dReal, an SMT solver for nonlinear formulas over the reals. The tool can handle various nonlinear real functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc. dReal implements the framework of δ-complete decision procedures: It returns either unsat or δ-sat on input formulas, where δ is a numerical error bound specified by the user. dReal also produces certificates of correctness for both δ-sat (a solution) and unsat answers (a proof of unsatisfiability).
5834868825ff05a97b016777	Large projects require multiple people to work together. Often, these people do not communicate as much as they should. One reason is that communication takes time and effort and causes interruptions. Another reason is that work related communication can be unpleasant. The goals of this research are to reduce the costs of communication and to make it more enjoyable in order to improve collaboration.
58cce233c50f90cdd38843c6	The Piano Tutor provides computer‐based instruction to beginning piano students. Intended as a supplement to traditional instruction, the Piano Tutor helps students by correcting mistakes before they become ingrained through practice and by teaching new material as soon as the student is ready.

58cce278c50f90cdd38843ed	Canon is a computer language designed to help composers create note-level control information for synthesizers or synthesis software. Canon was motivated by my need for a simple yet powerful language for teaching second-semester students of electronic and computer music, and also by my interest in putting concepts from the language Arctic (Dannenberg, McAvinney, and Rubine 1986; Rubine and Dannenberg 1987) to practical use in a MIDI studio.
58cce28bc50f90cdd38843f8	A method classifies data into multiple classes so that the data in each class have a class-conditional probability distribution. The class-conditional probability distributions of measured data are projected into a likelihood space. The projected class-conditional probability distributions in the likelihood space are then classified according to a discriminant classifier in likelihood space.
58cc8470c50f90cdd38811f2	A translation divergence occurs when the same information is conveyed in two languages by different structures (Dorr, 1993). The types of divergences that have been most widely discussed in the Machine Translation literature are lexical, structural, and morphological divergences (Trujillo, 1999; Dorr, 1993; Arnold et al., 1994).
58cce32ec50f90cdd3884456	A method extracts speech recognition features from a speech signal coded as a bitstream. First, the bitstream is decoded to recover linear predictive coding filter parameters, and a residual signal. Then, the linear predictive coding filter parameters and the residual signal are discriminatively combined into speech recognition features.
5834868825ff05a97b016b8a	A method and system for compressing a data base that permits queries on the compressed representation of the data base. Another feature is that an approximation of the values of the data base are derivable directly from the compressed representation of the data base. Yet another feature is correction of poor approximations of the reconstructed data. Still another feature is the capability of performing aggregate queries of the compressed representation of the data base.
58cde141c50f90cdd388c81c	We compare different parse tree representations for the task of Chinese Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), including dependency and constituency parse trees, two tree pruning methods, and neighbor features. Three learning models are compared. By using SVM classifier with neighbor features and pruning tree to phrase level we achieve significantly better speed and accuracy than state of the art Chinese SRL systems.
5834868825ff05a97b016c06	Language learning games require large quantities of content to be educational. This paper presents a boot-strapping method to generate game content using a combination of existing digital resources and the human computation of game players themselves. It describes a baseline method for hint generation to be used in a two-player game in which players select hints to assist each other. It then shows that the data gathered from player actions contains significant agreement in evaluation of automatically generated content.
58cca545c50f90cdd388236f	Our study focuses on finding new input devices for a system allowing users with any skill to configure and conduct a virtual orchestra in real-time. As a first step, we conducted a user study to learn more about the interaction between a conductor's gestures and the orchestra's reaction. During an orchestra rehearsal session, we observed a conductor's timing and gestures using the eWatch, a wrist-worn wearable computer and sensor platform. The gestures are analyzed and compared to the music of the orchestra.
5834868825ff05a97b016cfd	Micromachining in RF foundry processes enhances inductor and capacitor quality factors, increases varactor tuning range, and supports creation of electromechanical mixer-filters that downconvert RF signals from GHz to MHz frequency band with built-in frequency selectivity. An on-chip parallel receiver architecture and circuit blocks incorporating these MEMS devices for low-power operation are presented.
58cdf752c50f90cdd388d41e	This paper takes a cognition-centric approach for programming languages. It promotes the spreadsheet paradigm, with two concrete goals. First, it calls for the design and implementation of several language features to enhance the expressiveness of spreadsheet programming. Second, it describes a plan for rigorous empirical studies to retain the learnability of spreadsheet programming.
58cca62bc50f90cdd38823f0	This paper describes the analysis and generation grammars for English and Japanese as they were employed in the KBMT-89 program. We discuss word order, coordination, subcategorization, morphological rules, rule ordering and bi-directional grammars.
5834868825ff05a97b016d72	A system, method, and computer program product are provided for shading using a dynamic object-space grid. An object defined by triangle primitives in a three-dimensional (3D) space that is specific to the object is received and an object-space shading grid is defined for a first triangle primitive of the triangle primitives based on coordinates of the first triangle primitive in the 3D space.

58d0589ec50f90cdd38a29d1	Series elastic actuators primarily use linear springs in their drivetrains, which introduces a design tradeoff: soft springs provide higher torque resolution at the cost of system bandwidth, whereas stiff springs provide a fast response but lower torque resolution. Nonlinear springs (NLSs) potentially incorporate the benefits of both soft and stiff springs, but such springs are often large. An NLS design was recently proposed that combines a variable radius cam with a rubber elastic element, enabling a compact spring design.
5834868825ff05a97b017b97	People as news subjects play an important role in broadcast news and finding a specific person is a major challenge for multimedia retrieval. Beyond mere content-based general retrieval, this task requires exploitation of the structure, time sequence and meaning of news content. We introduce a comprehensive approach to discovering clues for finding a specific person in broadcast news video. Various information aspects are investigated, including text information, timing information, scene detection, and face recognition.
58cd1c30c50f90cdd388625d	This paper evaluates the student modeling procedure in the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is a practice environment that provides assistance to students as they write short programs. The tutor is constructed around a set of several hundred programming rules called the ideal student model, that allows the program to solve exercises along with the student. As the student works the tutor maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned the rules in the ideal model, in a process we call knowledge tracing.
5834868825ff05a97b01604f	1. Introduction Despite significant advances in the area of character animation, the problem of \nproducing high quality, natural- looking, physically-correct motions for agile characters in unpredictable \nenvironments is still largely unsolved. Data- driven approaches based on motion capture are \ngreat at producing natural-looking motion (provided of course that one can capture motions for \nthe character that is modeled), but do not generalize well for unpredictable environments (having \na character react realistically to external pushes or terrain variations for instance).
5834868825ff05a97b017402	A randomized polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the volume of a convex body K in n-dimensional Euclidean space is presented. The proof of correctness of the algorithm relies on recent theory of rapidly mixing Markov chains and isoperimetric inequalities to show that a certain random walk can be used to sample nearly uniformly from within K.
5834868825ff05a97b015fab	We used a hardware description language to construct a formal model of the cache coherence protocol described in the IEEE Futurebus+ standard. By applying temporal logic model checking techniques, we found errors in the standard. The result of our project is a concise, comprehensible and unambiguous model of the protocol that should be useful both to the Futurebus+ Working Group members, who are responsible for the protocol, and to actual designers of Futurebus+ boards.
58cd039ac50f90cdd38855b8	In this section we describe the data format used for encoding two files of size 17 KB containing the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages of six universities: Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There were 1, 933 words in the text, out of which 842 were distinct. Note that in our context, words are elements of the text separated by a space. For example, university and university. are counted as two different words, while Urbana-Champaign is counted as a single word.
5834868825ff05a97b015fac	This paper describes a technique based on network grammars and abstraction to verify families of state-transition systems. The family of state-transition systems is represented by a context-free network grammar. Using the structure of the network grammar our technique constructs an invariant which simulates all the state-transition systems in the family. A novel idea used in this paper is to use regular languages to express state properties. We have implemented our techniques and verified two non-trivial examples.
5834868825ff05a97b016d76	The world's demand for increasingly capable mobile visual computing applications running on a range of low-energy computing platforms shows no sign of slowing down for the foreseeable future.

5834868825ff05a97b017459	The identification of the referents of pronouns and definite descriptions in natural language processing (NLP) is a formidable task. We present our approach to pronominal and definite references in a German language dialogue system that is currently being implemented. This approach combines immediate focus and a special purpose reasoner that uses a KL-ONE like taxonomy within a modified form of discourse representation theory (DRT) structure (KAMP 81, HUNZE 88).
5834868825ff05a97b01745a	Information extraction, and specifically event and relation extraction from text, is an important problem in the age of big data. Current solutions to these problems require large amounts of training data or extensive feature engineering to find domain-specific events. We introduce a novel Interactive Learning approach that greatly reduces the number of training examples needed and requires no feature engineering. Our method achieves event detection precision in the 80 s and 90 s with only 1 h of human supervision.
5834868825ff05a97b01745b	The relationship between syntax and semantics is discussed, as an approach to thinking about different types of natural language parsers. Several types are then reviewed, and difficult natural language phenomena are discussed. The Psli3 semantic chart parser is presented as a possible solution to the problem of syntax, and its theoretical capabilities are discussed. An example of the current capabilities of the parser is presented.
58cd1dd1c50f90cdd388633f	How can an automated tutor assess children's spoken responses despite imperfect speech recognition? We address this challenge in the context of tutoring children in explicit strategies for reading comprehension. We report initial progress on collecting, annotating, and mining their spoken responses. Collection and annotation yield authentic but sparse data, which we use to synthesize additional realistic data. We train and evaluate a classifier to estimate the probability that a response mentions a given target.

This tutor is designed to support algebraic reasoning about real world problems. This study focuses on reasoning about situations that can be modeled with general linear form expressions (c= ax+ by). Formative evaluations of an early general linear form lesson showed that it helped students comprehend the underlying problem situations, but was less successful in helping students construct symbolic models of the situations.
5834868825ff05a97b017469	The Tongues speech-to-speech translation system was developed for the US Army chaplains, with fairly stringent constraints on time, budget, and available data. The resulting prototype was required to undergo a quite realistic field test. We describe the development and architecture of the system, the field test, and our analysis of its results. The system performed quite well, especially given its development constraints.

It can translate from English to Arabic and Arabic to English in the domain of medical interviews. We describe the general architecture and frameworks within which we developed each of the components: HMM-based recognition, interlingua translation (both rule and statistically based), and unit selection synthesis.
5834868825ff05a97b0174a2	In this work, we present a method for single-view reasoning about 3D surfaces and their relationships. We propose the use of mid-level constraints for 3D scene understanding in the form of convex and concave edges and introduce a generic framework capable of incorporating these and other constraints. Our method takes a variety of cues and uses them to infer a consistent interpretation of the scene. We demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the art and produce interpretations of the scene that link large planar surfaces.
5834868825ff05a97b0174a7	What primitives should we use to infer the rich 3D world behind an image? We argue that these primitives should be both visually discriminative and geometrically informative and we present a technique for discovering such primitives. We demonstrate the utility of our primitives by using them to infer 3D surface normals given a single image. Our technique substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art and shows improved cross-dataset performance.
5834868825ff05a97b0174dc	The central algorithmic problem in coding theory is the construction of explicit errorcorrecting codes with good parameters together with fast algorithms for encoding a message and decoding a noisy received word into the correct message. Over the last decade, significant new developments have taken place on this problem using graph-based/combinatorial constructions that exploit the power of expander graphs. The role of expander graphs in theoretical computer science is by now certainly well-appreciated.

5834868825ff05a97b0174fb	In this work, we have addressed several fundamental questions concerning list decoding. We began in the first part with the study of certain combinatorial aspects of list decoding, and established lower and upper bounds on the number of errors correctable via list decoding, as a function of the rate and minimum distance of the code.
5834868825ff05a97b0174fc	The decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon and AG-codes provide the first results which algorithmically exploit the potential of list decoding well beyond half the minimum distance. In addition, these codes are widely studied and used, and thus these algorithms are not only theoretically interesting, but could also have a lot of practical impact.
5834868825ff05a97b017502	We now move on to provide a sample of some of the applications which both combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of list decoding have found in contexts outside of coding theory. As it turns out, by now there are numerous such applications to complexity theory and cryptography.
5834868825ff05a97b017ac2	In this study, we report empirical results from forecasting field defect rates and predicting the number of field defects for a large commercial software system. We find that we are not able to accurately forecast field defect rates using a combined time-based and metrics-based approach, as judged by the Theil forecasting statistic. We suggest possible conditions that may have contributed to the poor results. Next, we use metrics-based approaches to predict the number of field defects within the six months after deployment.
5834868825ff05a97b017ac6	Abstract—Crowd development is a development process designed for transient workers of varying skill. Work is organized into microtasks, which are short, self-descriptive, and modular. Microtasks recursively spawn microtasks and are matched to workers, who accrue points reflecting value created. Crowd development might help to reduce time to market and software development costs, increase programmer productivity, and make programming more fun.

58d0264fc50f90cdd38a0522	This article presents a number of complementary algorithms for detecting faults on-board operating robots, where a fault is defined as a deviation from expected behavior. The algorithms focus on faults that cannot directly be detected from current sensor values but require inference from a sequence of time-varying sensor values. Each algorithm provides an independent improvement over the basic approach. These improvements are not mutually exclusive, and the algorithms may be combined to suit the application domain.
58ce79c4c50f90cdd38918c5	We combine configural and temporal difference learning in a classical conditioning model.

We have implemented the algorithm on the Sony AIBO entertainment robot, allowing us to interact with the conditioning model in real time.
5834868825ff05a97b0177f4	Internal localization, the problem of estimating relative pose for each module of a modular robot, is a prerequisite for many shape control, locomotion, and actuation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical approach that uses normalized cut to identify dense sub-regions with small mutual localization error, then progressively merges those sub-regions to localize the entire ensemble. Our method works well in both two and three dimensions, and requires neither exact measurements nor rigid inter-module connectors.

The representation is suitable for target architectures supporting predicated execution and aggressive speculation. In Pegasus information about the global dataflow of the program is encoded in local structures, enabling compact and efficient algorithms for program optimizations. As a proof of the versatility of Pegasus, we have used it in a compiler translating C programs to hardware implementations.

The initial report relied on simple statistical analytic methods, largely univariate and bivariate statistics. The current multivariate analysis replicates the basic results of the earlier study, while adding additional insights about the interactions among and comparative importance of the factors that make process improvement efforts likely to succeed or fail.
5834868825ff05a97b017c9a	Sparse signal models learned from data are widely used in audio, image, and video restoration. They have recently been generalized to discriminative image understanding tasks such as texture segmentation and feature selection. This paper extends this line of research by proposing a multiscale method to minimize least-squares reconstruction errors and discriminative cost functions under ℓ 0 or ℓ 1 regularization constraints. It is applied to edge detection, category-based edge selection and image classification tasks.

5834868825ff05a97b015fa6	With the advancement of computer technology, highly concurrent systems are being developed. The verification of such systems is a challenging task, as their state space grows exponentially with the number of processes. Partial order reduction is an effective technique to address this problem. It relies on the observation that the effect of executing transitions concurrently is often independent of their ordering. In this paper we present the basic principles behind partial order reduction and its implementation.
5834868825ff05a97b017ce5	Reranking has been a focal technique in multimedia retrieval due to its efficacy in improving initial retrieval results. Current reranking methods, however, mainly rely on the heuristic weighting. In this paper, we propose a novel reranking approach called Self-Paced Reranking (SPaR) for multimodal data. As its name suggests, SPaR utilizes samples from easy to more complex ones in a self-paced fashion. SPaR is special in that it has a concise mathematical objective to optimize and useful properties that can be theoretically verified.

We propose a test of different perspectives based on distribution divergence between the statistical models of two collections. Experimental results show that the test can successfully distinguish document collections of different perspectives from other types of collections.

5834868825ff05a97b017d0f	Searching for relevant material in documents containing transcription errors presents new challenges for Information Retrieval. This paper examines information retrieval effectiveness on a corpus of spoken broadcast news documents. For documents transcribed using speech recognition. a substantial number of retrieval errors are due to query terms that occur in the spoken document, but are not transcribed because they are not within the speech recognition system's lexicon, even if that lexicon contains twenty thousand words.
5834868825ff05a97b017d14	Parsing spoken input introduces serious problems not present in parsing typed natural language. In particular, indeterminacies and inaccuracies of acoustic recognition must be handled in an integral manner. Many techniques for parsing typed natural language do not adapt well to these extra demands. This paper describes an extension of semantic caseframe parsing to restricted-domain spoken input. The semantic caseframe grammar representation is the same as that used for earlier work on robust parsing of typed input.

5834868825ff05a97b0179c8	I. INTRODUCTION At the core of all autonomous robotics systems is a mobility system that takes \ndata from sensors as input, reconstructs the 3-D geometry of the terrain around the vehicle, assesses \nthe drivability of the terrain, detect obstacle regions, and modifies its currently planned path to \navoid newly discovered non-drivable areas. The cycle is repeated many times a second until \nthe vehicle reaches its goal destination. Typically, such a system is implemented by maintaining \na representation of the world in the form of a discrete grid which is used for planning.

Exploiting dual memory banks, however, is a challenging problem for compilers. This, in part, is due to the instruction-level parallelism, small numbers of registers,...
58cce7eec50f90cdd38846ee	In most real-world audio recordings, we encounter several types of audio events. In this paper, we develop a technique for detecting signature audio events, that is based on identifying patterns of occurrences of automatically learned atomic units of sound, which we call Acoustic Unit Descriptors or AUDs. Experiments show that the methodology works as well for detection of individual events and their boundaries in complex recordings.
58cd123fc50f90cdd3885d41	Synchronization and data movement are the key impediments to an efficient parallel execution. To ensure that data shared by multiple threads remain consistent, the programmer must use synchronization (eg, mutex locks) to serialize threads' accesses to data. This limits parallelism because it forces threads to sequentially access shared resources. Additionally, systems use cache coherence to ensure that processors always operate on the most up-to-date version of a value even in the presence of private caches.

58cc9dcec50f90cdd3881f53	Traditional notation has led to the continuation of a traditional music approach in which scores are static descriptions to be realized by performers. Borrowing programming concepts from computer science leads to score-like descriptions with the capability of expressing dynamic processes and interaction with performers. The implications for composition, performance, and future research are discussed.
5834868825ff05a97b015fb4	The main problem in model checking that prevents it from being used for veri cation of large systems is the state explosion problem. This problem often arises from combining parallel processes together. Many techniques have been proposed to overcome this di culty and, thus, increase the size of the systems that model checkers can handle. We describe several compositional model checkingtechniques used in practice and show a few examples demonstrating their performance.

5834868825ff05a97b017c96	Appropriate datasets are required at all stages of object recognition research, including learning visual models of object and scene categories, detecting and localizing instances of these models in images, and evaluating the performance of recognition algorithms. Current datasets are lacking in several respects, and this paper discusses some of the lessons learned from existing efforts, as well as innovative ways to obtain very large and diverse annotated datasets. It also suggests a few criteria for gathering future datasets.
58cde730c50f90cdd388cb55	We introduce a novel approach for resolving coreference when the trigger word refers to multiple (sometimes non-contiguous) clauses. Our approach is completely unsupervised, and our experiments show that Neural Network models perform much better (about 20% more accurate) than traditional feature-rich baseline models. We also present a new dataset for Biomedical Language Processing which, with only about 25% of the original corpus vocabulary, still captures the essential distributional semantics of the corpus.
58cde751c50f90cdd388cb66	We describe CMU LTI's participation in the KBP 2015 Event Track. We officially participated in Task 1: Event Nugget Detection track and Task 3: Event Coreference track. Our system rank high in both tracks. We found that our combined system is competitive but have room to improve. In addition, we have conducted follow up experiments by creating a simple piplined system, and We found it competitive comparing to the official submissions.
58c87553c50f90cdd3857723	This paper proposes a statistical mapping-based technique for guessing pronunciations of novel words from their spellings. The technique is based on the automatic determination and utilization of unidirectional mappings between n-tuples of characters and n-tuples of phonemes, and may be viewed as a statistical extension of analogy-based pronunciation guessing algorithms.
58d0386ac50f90cdd38a1253	This paper presents optimizations for verifying systems with complex time-invariant constraints. These constraints arise naturally from modeling physical systems, eg, in establishing the relationship between different components in a system. To verify constraint-rich systems, we propose two new optimizations. The first optimization is a simple, yet powerful, extension of the conjunctivepartitioning algorithm. The second is a collection of BDD-based macro-extraction and macro-expansion algorithms to remove state variables.
58cdd10ec50f90cdd388bfac	The purpose of this paper is to present new upper bounds on the complexity of algorithms for testing the primality of a number. The first upper bound is 0 (nl Y) 5 it improves the previously best known bound of D (nl/4) due to Pollard [ll1. The second upper bound is dependent on the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERR): assuming ERH, we produce an algorith which tests primality and runs in time 0 ((log n) 4) steps. Thus we show that primality is testable in time a polynomial in the length of the binary representation of a number.

58cdf6c1c50f90cdd388d3d2	Methods for solving sparse linear systems of equations can be categorized under two broad classes-direct and iterative. Direct methods are methods based on gaussian elimination. This report discusses one such direct method, namely Nested Dissection. Nested Dissection, originally proposed by Alan George, is a technique for solving sparse linear systems efficiently. This report is a survey of some of the work in the area of nested dissection and attempts to put it together using a common framework.

58c87c19c50f90cdd3857b2b	A non-deterministic automaton is very similar, except that it may transition to more than one state for a given input symbol. Furthermore, the machine can make a silent transition (also called ϵ-transition) without consuming an input symbol. We write Σϵ for Σ∪{ϵ} where ϵ is not in Σ.

5834868825ff05a97b017ccd	This technical report documents the comparison of Canid's initial bounding behavior to open-loop pronking on the XRL robot as a supplement to2, 3. The robots, shown in Figure 1 have nearly identical structure actuators, power-budgets, and electronics. The main differences are that XRL is a hexapod while Canid replaces the middle 2 leg motors with a parallel elastic actuated spine mechanism and uses four bar mechanisms on its front and rear legs. Further details about each robot are given in3, 4.
5834868825ff05a97b017cd1	This thesis develops methods of control that allow a multi-legged robot to vary its stepping pattern, the gait of a robot, during locomotion. By constructing feedback control around the gaits a robot may use, we produce behaviors allowing a robot to switch amongst or return to certain gaits while performing feedback control during locomotion.

58cdee93c50f90cdd388cf57	We generalize the Tukey depth to use cones instead of halfspaces. We prove a generalization of the center point theorem that for S⊂ Rd, there is a point s∈ S, with depth at least n d+ 1 for cones of half-angle 45◦. This gives a notion of data depth for which an approximate median can always be found among the original set.

58d0f5a3c50f90cdd38a9265	In an instance of the prize-collecting Steiner forest problem (PCSF) we are given an undirected graph G=(V, E), non-negative edge-costs c (e) for all e ε E, terminal pairs R={(si, ti)} 1≤ i≤ k, and penalties π 1,..., π k. A feasible solution (F, Q) consists of a forest F and a subset Q of terminal pairs such that for all (si, ti) ε R either si, ti are connected by F or (si, ti) ε Q. The objective is to compute a feasible solution of minimum cost c (F)+ π (Q). A game-theoretic version of the above problem has k players, one for each terminal-pair in R.
5834868825ff05a97b017947	This paper presents a framework for autonomous robots that reason from range data. We argue for spatial reasoning as a basic cognition mode for robots operating in unpredictable work environments and present a three-level architecture for modeling and planning from range data. Two implementations, robotic excavation with sonar ranging and mine navigation with laser ranging, illustrate the techniques and provide two experiences to evaluate the architecture.
58c869c6c50f90cdd3857045	The majority of on-body interfaces are limited by their ability to resolve inputs at high-resolution proximities. We address this problem for the hand and arm region by using innovative approaches to generate feature sets and classify the input signals. Incorporating this design into modern electronic devices may expedite the transition to, and increase the use of, on-body interfaces. This paper discusses the progress in prototyping and classifying the hand input signals.

58c8a5dac50f90cdd385941a	This paper aims to develop a system for estimating a vehicle's speed by analyzing its drive by acoustics with a passive audio microphone. Analysis of the vehicle's acoustics would primarily use the phenomenon of Doppler shift, and the instant at which vehicle is at closest-point-of approach. This approach uses a technique called Seam carving to track harmonics formed by vehicle particularly its engine noise. The method proposed is computationally inexpensive and can very easily be developed into mobile application.

58cf5cb7c50f90cdd3898de4	Icons in graphical user interfaces convey information in a mostly universal fashion that allows users to immediately interact with new applications, systems and devices. In this paper, we define Kineticons-an iconographic scheme based on motion. By motion, we mean geometric manipulations applied to a graphical element over time (eg, scale, rotation, deformation). In contrast to static graphical icons and icons with animated graphics, kineticons do not alter the visual content or “pixel-space” of an element.

58cff1e7c50f90cdd389dee3	A thread is a unit of execution, associated with a process, with its own thread ID, stack, stack pointer, program counter, condition codes, and general-purpose registers. Multiple threads associated with a process run concurrently in the context of that process, sharing its code, data, heap, shared libraries, signal handlers, and open files. Programming with threads instead of conventional processes is increasingly popular because threads are less expensive than processes and because they provide a trivial mechanism for sharing data.
58d02012c50f90cdd38a0087	For decades, people have expended untold amounts of effort trying to predict the stock market. We frame market prediction as an experts problem, in the online learning sense, and show that simple strategies have optimal regret properties. We show how to generalize these strategies to more exotic types of portfolios. We also show how to take advantage of recent empirical results in finance by creating feature portfolios, and how these can be used to achieve dramatic returns within the low-regret framework.

In a TMAS system, however, each agent may have a different state space, which can be rather large. Consequently, traditional approaches to multi-agent cooperative learning may not be able to scale up with...
5834868825ff05a97b01606b	An asymptomatic atypical U shaped cleft hand has been found in a 21-year-old lady attending OPD. On digital skiagram it was found that central digits were absent with remnants of bases of the metacarpals, which have fused with the carpal bones. Moreover, the scaphoid and trapezium had fused to form a single mass. There was no other anomaly in other limbs, so far searched for. An endeavor has been made to explain the anomaly with ontogenetic review.
58c88791c50f90cdd3858203	Abstract—In this paper, we compare two methods for prosody (duration and pitch) modification. These are prosody modification using instants of Significant Excitation and Mel-Cepstral vocoder. We show that duration modifications are better using Mel-Cepstral vocoder for higher modification factor while pitch modifications are better using instants of Significant Excitations. In the end we show that Mel-Cepstral vocoder provides flexibility for non-uniform prosody manipulation.
58cdf430c50f90cdd388d270	We present a simple spectral approach to the well-studied constrained clustering problem. It captures constrained clustering as a generalized eigenvalue problem with graph Laplacians. The algorithm works in nearly-linear time and provides concrete guarantees for the quality of the clusters, at least for the case of 2-way partitioning. In practice this translates to a very fast implementation that consistently outperforms existing spectral approaches both in speed and quality.

58c89232c50f90cdd3858882	A method and system recognizes an unknown gesture by directing an ultrasonic signal at an object making an unknown gestures. A set of Doppler signals are acquired of the ultrasonic signal after reflection by the object.

58c895d4c50f90cdd3858aa6	Many side-effecting programming activities, such as profiling and tracing, can be formulated as crosscutting concerns and be framed as side-effecting aspects in the aspect-oriented programming paradigm. The benefit gained from this separation of concerns is particularly evident in purely functional programming, as adding such aspects using techniques such as monadification will generally lead to crosscutting...
58c8a4fac50f90cdd3859391	A system and method reduces noise in a time series signal. A primary signal including stationary and non-stationary noise is modeled by a dynamic system having a continuum of states. A secondary signal including time series data is added to the primary signal to form a combined signal. The generic noise in the combined signal is estimated from samples of the combined signal using the dynamic system modeling the generic noise. Then, the estimated generic noise is removed from the combined signal to recover time series data.
58c90ce3c50f90cdd385d151	In the present paper, the authors demonstrated successful CR from short optical packets at 40 Gb/s, using a recently introduced technique that allows in principle for operation at ultra-high bit rates far beyond 40 Gb/s. The technique is based on the previously reported scheme that uses a Fabry-Perot Filter (FPF) for producing a clock resembling signal, followed by an optical power limiter in order to remove the strong peak power variation of the FPF's output, and thus provide a clock signal of high quality.

A merit factor of> 10 has been obtained at more than 100 lengths greater than 1000. The best merit factor for a binary sequence has been exceeded by ternary sequences at 40 lengths greater than 100.
5834868825ff05a97b017d6e	The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools, from hammers to tweezers. However, despite this remarkable dexterity, gestures on today's touch devices are simplistic, relying primarily on the chording of fingers: one-finger pan, two-finger pinch, four-finger swipe and similar. We propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical tools from the real world. In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction.

We then highlight key results from these studies, paying particular attention to the lessons they hold for guiding real-world password creation.
5834868825ff05a97b01612a	Cyberspace is the``place''where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. The place between the phones. The indefinite place out there, where the two of you, human beings, actually meet and communicate.

5834868825ff05a97b01689e	Why does Smith follow Johnson on Twitter? In most cases, the reason why users follow other users is unavailable. In this work, we answer this question by proposing TagF, which analyzes the who-follows-whom network (matrix) and the who-tags-whom network (tensor) simultaneously. Concretely, our method decomposes a coupled tensor constructed from these matrix and tensor. The experimental results on million-scale Twitter networks show that TagF uncovers different, but explainable reasons why users follow other users.
5834868825ff05a97b017abd	Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DSCP) has been proposed as a methodology to frame and analyze coordination in software development. Here, we propose concrete ways to cast rich social and product dependence graphs of software projects into the DSCP framework, suggest how the lack of congruence among these graphs may affect primary software engineering outcomes, and discuss the DSCP machinery that is most likely to provide necessary tools to test these hypotheses.
5834868825ff05a97b015fc3	Predicate abstraction is a major method for verification of software. However, the generation of the abstract Boolean program from the set of predicates and the original program suffers from an exponential number of theorem prover calls as well as from soundness issues. This paper presents a novel technique that uses an efficient SAT solver for generating the abstract transition relations of ANSI-C programs. The SAT-based approach computes a more precise and safe abstraction compared to existing predicate abstraction techniques.
58d13416c50f90cdd38aaf29	In this paper we propose a system for the analysis of user generated video (UGV). UGV often has a rich camera motion structure that is generated at the time the video is recorded by the person taking the video, ie, the?? camera person.?? We exploit this structure by defining a new concept known as camera view for temporal segmentation of UGV. The segmentation provides a video summary with unique...
5834868825ff05a97b015fc4	We used a hardware description language to construct a formal model of the cache coherence protocol described in the IEEE Futurebus+ standard. By applying temporal logic model checking techniques, we found errors in the standard. The result of our project is a concise, comprehensible and unambiguous model of the protocol that should be useful both to the Futurebus+ Working Group members, who are responsible for the protocol, and to actual designers of Futurebus+ boards.
58cd808bc50f90cdd38895f4	Understanding smartphone users is fundamental for creating better smartphones, and improving the smartphone usage experience and generating generalizable and reproducible research. However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users.
5834868825ff05a97b0166a8	When designing for or discussing privacy, it is critical to identify the conditions that create a system's or phenomenon's privacy implications. We present a set of interdependent dimensions that, when applied to the analysis of a privacy-related system or phenomenon, can expose the factors that determine the role of privacy therein. This can help focus the scope of discourse and the design of privacy in the HCI and ubiquitous computing communities.
5834868825ff05a97b017a4e	What: Project LISTEN is developing a novel weapon against illiteracy: an automated reading coach that displays a story on a computer screen, listens to a child read it aloud, and helps where needed. The coach provides a combination of reading and listening, in which the child reads wherever possible, and the coach helps wherever necessary. We demonstrated a prototype of this coach at the ARPA Workshop on Human Language Technology in March 1994. A short video shows the coach in action [1].
58cd89d1c50f90cdd3889ac1	ABSTRACT: Torsion of Gall bladder is extremely rare condition and poses diagnostic challenge. The incidence of this condition is uncommon in children. We report a case of torsion of Gall bladder in a child presenting as peritonitis which was only detected at laparotomy. The gallbladder was found to be twisted around its pedicle and to be gangrenous. Cholecystectomy was performed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. We also reviewed 245 cases reported in the Japanese literature.

While unauthorized copies of movies have been distributed via portable physical media for some time, low-cost, high-bandwidth Internet connections and peer-topeer file sharing networks provide highly efficient distribution media.
58cd8a00c50f90cdd3889ada	In order to match the versatility and robust mechanical properties of their natural counterparts, bio-inspired robots must be soft and elastically deformable. This not only requires new classes of artificial muscle actuators but also artificial nervous tissue and skin to support stretchable electronic connectivity, sensing, and automation.. In recent years a broad range of materials composites, and so-calleddeterministic micropatterned architectures have been introduced to support soft and stretchable electronic functionality.

5834868825ff05a97b017bb7	Summary One of the central concerns of Evolutionary Developmental biology is to understand how the specification of cell types can change during evolution. In the last decade, developmental biology has progressed toward a systems level understanding of cell specification processes. In particular, the focus has been on determining the regulatory interactions of the repertoire of genes that make up gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Echinoderms provide an extraordinary model system for determining how GRNs evolve.
58cd1b6bc50f90cdd38861f6	This paper examines a plan scaffolding interface in the ACT Programming Tutor. This interface is derived from a cognitive analysis of the task structure and has been shown to accelerate the acquisition of skill. This study examines the impact of the planning interface on the learning process and on the structure of the knowledge that results. Several measures of students' declarative knowledge of programming are developed to predict tutor learning rates. The tutor's predictions of students' quiz performance are also examined.

58cdacd0c50f90cdd388ace0	In this paper, we describe the JAVELIN Cross Language Question Answering system, which includes modules for question analysis, keyword translation, document retrieval, information extraction and answer generation. In the NTCIR6 CLQA2 evaluation, our system achieved 19% and 13% accuracy in the English-to-Chinese and English-to-Japanese subtasks, respectively. An overall analysis and a detailed module-by-module analysis are presented.
5834868825ff05a97b017c3f	Task dependencies drive the need to coordinate work activities. We describe a technique for using automatically generated archi-val data to compute coordination requirements, ie, who must coordinate with whom to get the work done. Analysis of data from a large software development project revealed that coordina-tion requirements were highly volatile, and frequently extended beyond team boundaries. Congruence between coordination re-quirements and coordination activities shortened development time.
5834868825ff05a97b017c40	Geographically distributed development teams face extraordinary communication and coordination problems. The authors' case study clearly demonstrates how common but unanticipated events can stretch project communication to the breaking point. Project schedules can fall apart, particularly during integration. Modular design is necessary, but not sufficient to avoid this fate.
5834868825ff05a97b016091	In this experimental work attention has been focused on the characterization and quantification of nano-sized organic carbon (NOC) particulates from the exhaust of a small non-road SI engine. A hydrosol of the sample has been prepared by collecting the sample from the engine exhaust manifold, operating at no load condition. Existence of NOC particles has been confirmed using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. DLS and TEM image of the sample shows that the particles are below the size range of 5 nm.
5834868825ff05a97b017c43	Geographically distributed development creates new questions about how to coordinate multi-site work. In this paper, we present four methods product development organizations used to coordinate their work: functional areas of expertise, product structure, process steps, and customization. We describe the benefits and difficulties with each model. Finally, we discuss two difficulties that occur irrespective of the model used: consequences of unequal distribution of project mass, and finding expertise.
5834868825ff05a97b017c58	Applying machine learning techniques to realYtime computer games is an active research field. In this paper we present Cerberus, a machine learning framework for teamY based Capture The Flag (CTF) games. This framework utilizes reinforcement learning to select highYlevel actions that achieve best team behaviour and utilizes neural networks to control fighting behaviour of team individuals. Our proposed framework also combines waypoints and influence maps for effective path planning.

5834868825ff05a97b017c63	This work describes an approach for using several levels of data fusion in the domain of autonomous off-road navigation. We are focusing on outdoor obstacle detection, and we present techniques that leverage on data fusion and machine learning for increasing the reliability of obstacle detection systems. We are combining color and infrared (IR) imagery with range information from a laser range finder. We show that in addition to fusing data at the pixel level, performing high level classifier fusion is beneficial in our domain.
58cdd081c50f90cdd388bf62	We present a new algorithm that produces an approximation of the 1-dimensional skeleton of a Delaunay mesh (or its dual Voronoi diagram) for point sets in any dimension with guaranteed optimal mesh size and quality. Our comparison based algorithm runs in time O (2O (d)(n log n+ m)), where n is the input size, m is the output point set size, and d is the ambient dimension. The constants only depend on the desired element quality bounds.
5834868825ff05a97b017b2f	Executive Summary The Urban Challenge represents a technological leap beyond the previous Grand Challenges. The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary.
5834868825ff05a97b016e99	In order to create a useful, gracefully functioning system for travel arrangements, we have first observed the task as it is accomplished by a human. We then imitated the human while making the user believe he was dialoguing with an automatic system. As we gradually built our system, we devised ways to assess progress and to detect errors. The following described the manner in which the Carnegie Mellon Communicator was built, data collected, and assessment begun using these criteria.
58cfe0b4c50f90cdd389d22b	Formal verification and validation play a crucial role in making cyber-physical systems (CPS) safe. Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained, including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics. In CPS, models are essential; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world. If the real system fits to the model, its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified with respect to the model.
58cfed4cc50f90cdd389db7d	We derive a simple performance model for a family of sparse irregular applications and use the model to predict running times on the Cray T3D. Based on insights gained from applying the model to the applications, we identify some limitations of modern graph partitioners and suggest some improvements. In particular, we suggest an approach whereby a partitioner could use our model to attempt to minimize running time on a specific system.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea1	The technology developed for task-based spoken dialogue systems (SDS) has a significant potential for Computer-Assisted Language Learning. Based on the CMU Let's Go SDS, we describe two areas in which we investigated adaptations of the technology to non-native speakers: speech recognition and correction prompt generation. Although difficulties remain, particularly towards robust understanding, results prove that this technology can be used to provide realistic, involved environment for language learning.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea2	This paper examines the literature on the use of crowdsourcing for speech-related tasks: speech acquisition, transcription and annotation as well as the assessment of speech technology. 29 papers were found, representing, 37 different experiments, which were annotated and analyzed to find trends in the field. The paper focuses on the different techniques used for quality control and the variety of sources of “crowds”. Finally, we propose several challenges for the future of crowdsourcing for speech processing.
58d0f315c50f90cdd38a9129	Network Design is an active research area in the intersection of Combinatorial Optimization and Theoretical Computer Science that focuses on problems arising in the realm of modern communication networks. During the last 30 years of research in this field a number of major techniques have emerged; the aim of this article is to provide a survey of some of them. Each section concentrates on one technique; we first illustrate it using the well-known minimum spanning tree problem, and then present an advanced application.
5834868825ff05a97b016b4c	The electrocaloric effect in thin films of a poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene chlorofluoroethylene) terpolymer (62.6/29.4/8 mol.%, 11–12 μ m thick) is directly measured by infrared imaging at ambient conditions. The adiabatic temperature change is estimated to be 5.2 K for an applied electric field of 90 V/μ m. The temperature change is independent of the operating frequency in the range of 0.03–0.3 Hz and is stable over a testing period of 30 min. Application of this terpolymer is promising for micro-scale refrigeration.
5834868825ff05a97b016b55	In this paper, we describe an automatic technique for meshing multilayer CMOS micromachined structures for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) from device layout. The technique is based on a 3D canonical representation of the different CMOS layers and feature recognition of plate masses, springs, beams and comb drives within the surface micromachined MEMS device. Manual meshing of devices for FEA is very tedious for multilayer structures as each layer must be separately meshed and subsequently merged.
5834868825ff05a97b016c37	We developed two versions of a system, called iList, that helps students learn linked lists, an important topic in computer science curricula. The two versions of iList differ on the level of feedback they can provide to the students, specifically in the explanation of syntax and execution errors. The system has been fielded in multiple classrooms in two institutions. Our results indicate that iList is effective, is considered interesting and useful by the students, and its performance is getting closer to the performance of human tutors.
58ccb891c50f90cdd3882dd4	The goal of this workshop is to better understand how and what we can learn from data recorded when students interact with educational software. Several researchers have been working in these areas, largely independent of what others are doing. The time is ripe to exchange information about what we've learned.
5834868825ff05a97b016de0	How will a virus propagate in a real network&quest; How long does it take to disinfect a network given particular values of infection rate and virus death rate&quest; What is the single best node to immunize&quest; Answering these questions is essential for devising network-wide strategies to counter viruses. In addition, viral propagation is very similar in principle to the spread of rumors, information, and “fads,” implying that the solutions for viral propagation would also offer insights into these other problem settings.
5834868825ff05a97b016e3d	This paper proposes a new approach to a broad class of recognition problems ranging from medical diagnosis to vision. The features of this approach include a top-down hypothesize-and-test style and the use of a great deal of high-level knowledge about the subject. This knowledge is packaged into small groups of related facts and procedures called frames.
5834868825ff05a97b017b19	We propose an approach to identify and segment objects from scenes that a person (or robot) encounters in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Images collected in those cluttered scenes contain multiple objects. Each image provides only a partial, possibly very different view of each object. An object instance discovery program must be able to link pieces of visual information from multiple images and extract the consistent patterns. Most papers on unsupervised discovery of object models are concerned with object categories.
58cf8219c50f90cdd389a151	Current publish/subscribe systems offer a range of expressive subscription languages for constraints. However, classical systems restrict the publish operation to be a single published object that contains only constants and no constraints. We introduce symmetric publish/subscribe, a novel generalization of publish/subscribe where both publications and subscriptions contain constraints in addition to constants. Published objects are matched to subscriptions by computing the intersection of their constraints.
5834868825ff05a97b016e92	We describe several language and pronunciation modeling techniques that were applied to the 1996 Hub 4 Broadcast News transcription task. These include topic adaptation, the use of remote corpora, vocabulary size optimization, n-gram cutoff optimization, modeling of spontaneous speech, handling of unknown linguistic boundaries, higher order n-grams, weight optimization in rescoring, and lexical modeling of phrases and acronyms.
58cfb2a4c50f90cdd389ba59	The present invention relates to the identification of genetic markers patients with leukemia, especially including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at high risk for relapse, especially high risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and associated methods and their relationship to therapeutic outcome. The present invention also relates to diagnostic, prognostic and related methods using these genetic markers, as well as kits which provide microchips and/or immunoreagents for performing analysis on leukemia patients.
5834868825ff05a97b016e96	Spoken dialog systems typically use a limited number of non-understanding recovery strategies and simple heuristic policies to engage them (eg first ask user to repeat, then give help, then transfer to an operator). We propose a supervised, online method for learning a non-understanding recovery policy over a large set of recovery strategies. The approach consists of two steps: first, we construct runtime estimates for the likelihood of success of each recovery strategy, and then we use these estimates to construct a policy.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea3	A database of spoken French sounds is described with the methodology of the way in which it was built up (speaker selection, recording conditions, computer control of data acquisition,...). The base will contain various corpus for evaluation and training of recognition and synthesis systems, acoustic, articulatory and prosodic studies. The preliminary labeling and further exploitations of this database are starting in several laboratories.
5834868825ff05a97b016133	1 Executive Summary In this report we examine the state of online privacy at the end of 2006 through the lens of website privacy policies. We look at three main areas: privacy practices of the most popular websites as compared with a random sample of websites that post privacy policies, privacy policies of websites in the US financial industry, and trends in the adoption of the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P).
58cd3eddc50f90cdd3887474	We extend Goodman's result on the cardinality of monochromatic triangles in a 2-colored complete graph to the case of bounding the number of triangles in the first color. We apply it to derive the upper bounds on some non-diagonal Ramsey numbers. In particular we show that R (K4− e, K8)<= 45.

5834868825ff05a97b01615a	A moving object tracked within a field of view environment of a two-dimensional data feed of a calibrated video camera is represented by a three-dimensional model. An appropriate three-dimensional mesh-based volumetric model for the object is initialized by using a back-projection of a corresponding two-dimensional image. A texture of the object is projected onto the three-dimensional model, and two-dimensional tracks of the object are upgraded to three-dimensional motion to drive a three-dimensional model.
5834868825ff05a97b01615b	A computer generates a three dimensional map of a pathway area using a plurality of overhead images. The computer determines a forecasted weather pattern to occur in the pathway area. The computer analyzes the three dimensional map and the forecasted weather pattern to predict one or more violations of the pathway. The computer generates a priority for the one or more predicted violations of the pathway. The computer generates a plan for pathway management of the pathway area.
5834868825ff05a97b017c65	An efficient way of building a polyhedral approximation of a set of points in 3-D space is described. The points are the vertices of a planar graph embedded in a surface of genus 0 and are obtained by a laser range finder. The technique presented here is a generalization of an existing algorithm (R. Duda and P. Hart, Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, Wiley-Interscience, New York 1973) for the polygonal approximation of a simple curve in 2-D space.
5834868825ff05a97b017c67	In this paper, we describe our work on a robot navigation system using an omnidirectional camera as the primary sensor. An omnidirectional structure from motion algorithm is presented with its uncertainty analyzed. We evaluate the omnidirectional SFM on both synthetic data and on real image sequences. Comparison with the conventional camera is made and we show that in certain situations the omnidirectional SFM gives better results than the conventional one by taking advantage of its larger field of view.

We address challenges for MT in generation of Polish, a language With rich inﬂection, morphologically marked aspect and free word order.
58d03933c50f90cdd38a12e5	ABSTRACT: Long-period strong motions (> 0.9 second) are simulated in the Kobe area for the mainshock (1/17/95) and the aftershock (2/2/95) of the Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) earthquake. In order to model ground motions in the realistic and highly heterogeneous basin structure, an unstructured 3D FEM (Finite Element Method) is used, which runs efficiently on parallel computers. The simulation results show strong 3D basin effects, especially within the disaster belt at the target sites from KBU to RKI.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea5	This paper looks at how speech-interactive CALL can help the classroom teacher carry out recommendations from immersion-based approaches to language instruction. Emerging methods for pronunciation tutoring are demonstrated from Carnegie Mellon University's FLUENCY project, addressing not only phone articulation but also speech prosody, responsible for the intonation and rhythm of utterances. New techniques are suggested for eliciting freely constructed yet specifically targeted utterances in speech-interactive CALL.

5834868825ff05a97b015fdc	In this paper, we study the application of propositional decision procedures in hardware verification. In particular, we apply bounded model checking, as introduced in [1], to equivalence and invariant checking. We present several optimizations that reduce the size of generated propositional formulas. In many instances, our SAT-based approach can significantly outperform BDD-based approaches. We observe that SAT-based techniques are particularly efficient in detecting errors in both combinational and sequential designs.
5834868825ff05a97b016d52	A thumbnail of an original document has at least one appearance characteristic that is different from a corresponding appearance characteristic in an original document. When retrieving a document associated with the thumbnail, a document version is displayed that is more similar in appearance to the thumbnail than the original document. If desired, one or more further versions of the document, closer to or identical to the first version, may be subsequently displayed.
58cca58bc50f90cdd3882395	Composers have used formalized procedures to create music throughout history. With the advent of the computer, algorithmic composition allows composers not only to create and experiment with different formalisms, but to hear and evaluate results quickly. Often in algorithmic composition, the composer has only a vague idea how the output will sound, but because the input is highly automated, the composer can make adjustments to take advantage of happy accidents, program bugs, and other creative sources of sound.

58ce2f42c50f90cdd388f137	Question-answering systems are expanding beyond information retrieval and information extraction, to become fullfledged, complex NLP applications. In this paper we discuss the evaluation of question-answering systems as complex NLP systems, and suggest three different dimensions for evaluation: objective or information-based evaluation; subjective evaluation; and architectural evaluation. We also discuss the role of ambiguity resolution in QA systems, and how ambiguity resolution might be evaluated.
58ce3008c50f90cdd388f19f	Event coreference is an important task for full text analysis. However, previous work uses a variety of approaches, sources and evaluation, making the literature confusing and the results incommensurate. We provide a description of the differences to facilitate future research. Second, we present a supervised method for event coreference resolution that uses a rich feature set and propagates information alternatively between events and their arguments, adapting appropriately for each type of argument.
5834868825ff05a97b017ae8	In this work, we present a method for single-view reasoning about 3D surfaces and their relationships. We propose the use of mid-level constraints for 3D scene understanding in the form of convex and concave edges and introduce a generic framework capable of incorporating these and other constraints. Our method takes a variety of cues and uses them to infer a consistent interpretation of the scene. We demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the art and produce interpretations of the scene that link large planar surfaces.

58ccb99fc50f90cdd3882e66	This study examines the algorithm design process for 59 LISP programmers who tackle a classic artificial intelligence search problem for the first time. Programmers were asked to code a single function called descendent, that was of average length and that performs a depth-first search over an hierarchy. This was a fairly difficult task. In this paper, we outline a set of basic planning steps for designing this algorithm and examine variations in the 59 solutions that reflect divergences at different steps.

5834868825ff05a97b017a63	Video analysis has been attracting increasing research due to the proliferation of internet videos. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance on internet quality video analysis. Particularly, we work on the scenario of few labeled training videos being provided, which is less focused in multimedia. To being with, we consider how to more effectively harness the evidences from the low-level features. Researchers have developed several promising features to represent videos to capture the semantic information.

This short introduction to KANT is intended to describe the KANT software, the kinds of translation tasks it can perform, and the steps necessary to build a KANT application in a particular customer domain.
58cde344c50f90cdd388c936	We present an approach to pronominal anaphora resolution using KANT Controlled Language and the KANTOO multilingual MT system. Our algorithm is based on a robust, syntax-based approach that applies a set of restrictions and preferences to select the correct antecedent. We report a success rate of 93.3% on a training corpus with 286 anaphors, and 88.8% on held-out data with 144 anaphors. Our approach translates anaphors to Spanish with 97.9% accuracy and to German with 94.4% accuracy on held-out data.

5834868825ff05a97b017c83	We propose an iterative method for the recovery of the projective structure and motion from multiple images. It has been recently noted that by scaling the measurement matrix by the true projective depths, recovery of the structure and motion is possible by factorization. The reliable determination of the projective depths is crucial to the success of this approach. The previous approach recovers these projective depths using pairwise constraints among images. We first discuss a few important drawbacks with this approach.

5834868825ff05a97b017c8d	There has been a recent push in extraction of 3D spatial layout of scenes. However, none of these approaches model the 3D interaction between objects and the spatial layout. In this paper, we argue for a parametric representation of objects in 3D, which allows us to incorporate volumetric constraints of the physical world. We show that augmenting current structured prediction techniques with volumetric reasoning significantly improves the performance of the state-of-the-art.

5834868825ff05a97b016f2d	An n-lift of a graph K is a graph with vertex set V (K)×[n], and for each edge (i, j)∈ E (K) there is a perfect matching between {i}×[n] and {j}×[n]. If these matchings are chosen independently and uniformly at random then we say that we have a random n-lift. We show that there are constants h1, h2 such that if h≥ h1 then a random n-lift of the complete graph Kh is hamiltonian whp and if h≥ h2 then a random n-lift of the complete bipartite graph Kh, h is hamiltonian whp.
5834868825ff05a97b016f2e	We study properties of a simple random walk on the random digraph Dn, p when np= dlogn, d> 1. We prove that whp the value πv of the stationary distribution at vertex v is asymptotic to deg−(v)/m where deg−(v) is the in-degree of v and m= n (n− 1) p is the expected number of edges of Dn, p. If d= d (n)→∞ with n, the stationary distribution is asymptotically uniform whp. Using this result we prove that, for d> 1, whp the cover time of Dn, p is asymptotic to dlog (d/(d− 1)) nlogn. If d= d (n)→∞ with n, then the cover time is asymptotic to nlogn.

Each of the cells are labeled as foreground if accumulated edge energy within the cell meets an edge energy threshold, or if color intensities for different colors within each cell differ by a color intensity differential threshold, or as a function of combinations of said determinations.
58cfddf2c50f90cdd389d0bf	When optimizing array locality for cache performance in a loop, a conventional approach is tiling which keeps the current memory layout of array but change execution order of instructions so that cached content will be reused for future execution before they are replaced. However, this scheme may fail when the execution reordering is unavailable due to data dependency or other constraints.

5834868825ff05a97b016e58	The purpose is to automatically constitute phonetic dictionaries for speech comprehension systems. The method consists of finding the best path in a matrix in which the phonemes pronounced are associated with each stable instant detected in the speech signal. The phonetic string is obtained from an orthographic-phonetic transcription module that takes into account the phonological variations due to the language itself and due to the speaker. Several pronunciations of one word are proposed.

Hyperspectral remote sensing data can be used to classify the different objects with different spectral characters. So we can get the position and area of the invasive plants from the hyperspectral images, which is important to aid to the manual in-situ remove work and save the labor and resources. In this paper, the hyperspectral data on HJ-1 satellite was used to monitor the invasive plant—Solidago Canadensis in Yixing city, Jiangsu Province.

5834868825ff05a97b016004	Varied sources of error contribute to the challenge of facial action unit detection. Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else; a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples.
5834868825ff05a97b016ea6	With the present generation of speech recognizers dealing with speaker-independent continuous speech and medium-sized vocabularies, the possibilities for their application are becoming larger, and yet some applications have not yet been tried, or have been tried with heavy constraints on the user, due to the expected poor recognition performance, and the lack of results to date in the domain of prosody has severely limited the use of that information. The author thinks that researchers may be overly pessimistic.
5834868825ff05a97b016fa7	Abstract/Description: We study the average-case complexity of shortest-paths problems in the vertex-potential model. The vertex-potential model is a family of probability distributions on complete directed graphs with\\emph {arbitrary} real edge lengths but without negative cycles. We show that on a graph with $ n $ vertices and with respect to this model, the single-source shortest-paths problem can be solved in $ O (n^ 2) $ expected time, and the all-pairs shortest-paths problem can be solved in $ O (n^ 2\\log n) $ expected time.

PBVI approximates an exact value iteration solution by selecting a small set of representative belief points and then tracking the value and its derivative for those points only. By using stochastic trajectories to choose belief points, and by maintaining only one value hyper-plane per point, PBVI successfully solves large problems: we present results on a robotic laser tag problem as well as three test domains from the literature.

5834868825ff05a97b017ca9	We present a two-layer hierarchical formulation to exploit different levels of contextual information in images for robust classification. Each layer is modeled as a conditional field that allows one to capture arbitrary observation-dependent label interactions. The proposed framework has two main advantages. First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (eg, pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (eg, relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner.
5834868825ff05a97b0160c8	We present a logic for reasoning about properties of secure systems. The logic is built around a concurrent programming language with constructs for modeling machines with shared memory, a simple form of access control on memory, machine resets, cryptographic operations, network communication, and dynamically loading and executing unknown (and potentially untrusted) code. The adversary's capabilities are constrained by the system interface as defined in the programming model (leading to the name CSI-ADVERSARY).

5834868825ff05a97b016010	This paper explores the challenges of attaining engineering quality in robotics through the experiences of the Lincoln High School robotics team, the Nanites. In robotics, engineering quality in hardware-software co-design is important. While software is written in the abstract world, it is executed on robot's hardware, which interacts with the physical world to accomplish its missions. The quality of the interactions between the robot's sensors, motors, and the physical world is critical to the success of the missions.

Experiments show that this method results in better pronunciation estimation and word recognition accuracy than that obtained either with a single example of the word or using conventional approaches to pronunciation estimation using multiple examples.
58cdf40ac50f90cdd388d25b	We present a simple spectral approach to the well-studied constrained clustering problem. It captures constrained clustering as a generalized eigenvalue problem in which both matrices are graph Laplacians. The algorithm works in nearly-linear time and provides concrete guarantees for the quality of the clusters, at least for the case of 2-way partitioning. In practice this translates to a very fast implementation that consistently outperforms existing spectral approaches both in speed and quality.
5834868825ff05a97b0160e9	This paper devotes to the channel estimation of a rapidly time varying environment for TD-HSPA+ technology. Based on the QR factorization of the midamble matrix, a modified channel estimator is proposed. To validate the method, several simulated cases with existing B. Steiner, Least squares (LS) and Minimum mean square error (MMSE) methods are considered. The simulation results demonstrate that the modified factorization method is more efficient, numerically stable and take less runtime than the conventional methods.

5834868825ff05a97b017d44	While touchscreens allow extensive programmability and have become ubiquitous in today's gadgetry, such configurations lack the tactile sensations and feedback that physical buttons provide. As a result, these devices require more attention to use than their button-enabled counterparts. Still, the displays provide the ultimate interface flexibility and thus afford a much larger design space to application developers.
5834868825ff05a97b0160ee	This paper presents the design of a compact planar monopole antenna with triple band notched characteristics. The inverted U type slot in the patch results in rejection band centered at 5.5 GHz. A hairpin slot in the feed line leads to good suppression at 6.8 GHz and rejection band centered at 8.1 GHz is obtained by etching out incomplete inverted C type slots. The peak gain obtained is 4.3 dBi. The group delay shows a flat response lying within 1ns except at the notch frequencies.

The class of k-contractable graphs includes the graphs of bounded valence and the graphs of bounded genus. The algorithm uses several new ideas including:(1) it removes portions of the graph and replaces them with groups which are used to keep track of the symmetries of these portions;(2) it maintains with each group a tower of equivalence relation which allows a decomposition of the group.

In this paper, we present work towards detecting one type of group process which provides an important window into the inner workings of a group, namely “idea co-construction (ICC)”. What is unique about our approach in relation to other educational data mining techniques is that we adopt insights from sociolinguistic theories by modeling stylistic convergence of speech.

The next time the system sees the same person and hears the same voice, it can replay parts of the last conversation in compressed form. Results from a prototype system show the effectiveness of combining of face recognition and speaker identification for retrieving conversations.

5834868825ff05a97b016fbc	We consider a simple model of an agent (which we call a spider) moving between the nodes of a randomly growing web graph. It is presumed that the agent examines the page content of the node for some specific topic. In our model the spider makes a random walk on the existing set of vertices. We compare the success of the spider on web graphs of two distinct types. For a random graph web graph model, in which new vertices join edges to existing vertices uniformly at random, the expected proportion of unvisited vertices tends to 0.57.

58cdf041c50f90cdd388d044	We present an example where Ruppert's refinement algorithm for quality 2D Delaunay mesh generation runs in time quadratic in the size of the output mesh. For any n> 1, input and output mesh sizes of our example are Θ (n), the bounding box dimensions are 1× Θ (n), and the algorithm running time is Θ (n2). Because Θ (n2) is a theoretical upper bound on the running time of Ruppert's refinement algorithm, our example is tight.
58cdf266c50f90cdd388d175	In this paper we present two algorithms for testing primality of integer. The first algorithm in steps; while, the second runs in n) step but assumes the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. We also show that a class of functions which includes the Euler phi function are computationally equivalent to factoring integers.
58cdf28dc50f90cdd388d18a	A polynomial time algorithm for testing isomorphism of graphs which are pairwise k-separable for fixed k is given. The pairwise k-separable graphs are those graphs where each pair of distinct vertices are k-separable. This is a natural generalization of the bounded valence test of Luks. The subgroup of automorphisms of a hypergraph whose restriction to the vertices is in a given group, for fixed k is constructed in polynomial time.

5834868825ff05a97b017cc3	A system, method, and computer program product are provided for shading using a dynamic object-space grid. An object defined by triangle primitives in a three-dimensional (3D) space that is specific to the object is received and an object-space shading grid is defined for a first triangle primitive of the triangle primitives based on coordinates of the first triangle primitive in the 3D space. A shader program is executed by a processing pipeline to compute a shaded value at a point on the object-space shading grid for the first triangle primitive.
58cce5cec50f90cdd38845ce	We describe a method that aligns polyphonic audio recordings of music to symbolic score information in standard MIDI files without the difficult process of polyphonic transcription. By using this method, we can search through a MIDI database to find the MIDI file corresponding to a polyphonic audio recording.
5834868825ff05a97b017015	We consider the parallel greedy algorithm of Coppersmith, Raghavan, and Tompa (Proc. of 28th Annual IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 260–269, 1987) for finding the lexicographically first maximal independent set of a graph. We prove an Ω (log n) bound on the expected number of iterations for most edge densities. This complements the O (log n) bound proved in Calkin and Frieze (Random Structures and Algorithms, Vol. 1, pp. 39–50, 1990).

58cce406c50f90cdd38844cf	ABSTRACT. A basic level of music understanding is required to recognize the correspondence between jazz improvisations and their underiying chord progressions. ln this study, techniques are examined for building a computer system that can recognize and follow a jazz solo by first deducing where beats fall in relation to the solo, and then by using a statistical matching method to find the most likely relationship to a chord progression.

5834868825ff05a97b01702a	Dedicated to the memory of Paul Erdős Let H be a simple graph having no isolated vertices. An (H, k)-vertex-cover of a simple graph G=(V, E) is a collection of subgraphs of G satisfying 1., for all i= 1,..., r, 2., 3., for all, and 4. each is in at most k of the. We consider the existence of such vertex covers when H is a complete graph,, in the context of extremal and random graphs.
5834868825ff05a97b017030	Network science has emerged over the last years as an interdisciplinary area spanning traditional domains including mathematics, computer science, sociology, biology and economics. Since complexity in social, biological and economical systems, and more generally in complex systems, arises through pairwise interactions there exists a surging interest in understanding networks.
5834868825ff05a97b017035	We consider a random digraph D α, β (n) with vertex set {1, 2,…, n} in which each vertex v independently chooses α random arcs entering v and β random arcs leaving v. We compute the limiting probability that D α, β (n) is strongly connected as n tends to infinity. This solves an open problem from [2].
5834868825ff05a97b01703d	We study the expected value of the length L n of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph K n when each edge e is given an independent uniform [0, 1] edge weight. We sharpen the result of Frieze [6] that lim n→∞ $\\mathbb {E} $(L n)= ζ (3) and show that $ $\\mathbb {E}(L_n)=\\zeta (3)+\\frac {c_1}{n}+\\frac {c_2+ o (1)}{n^{4/3}}, $ $ where c 1, c 2 are explicitly defined constants.
5834868825ff05a97b017021	We consider the problem of traveling among random points in Euclidean space, when only a random fraction of the pairs are joined by traversable connections. In particular, we show a threshold for a pair of points to be connected by a geodesic of length arbitrarily close to their Euclidean distance, and analyze the minimum length Traveling Salesperson Tour, extending the Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley theorem to this setting.
5834868825ff05a97b016034	Effortless one-touch capture of video is a unique capability of wearable devices such as Google Glass. We use this capability to create a new type of crowd-sourced system in which users receive queries relevant to their current location and opt-in preferences. In response, they can send back live video snippets of their surroundings. A system of result caching, geolocation and query similarity detection shields users from being overwhelmed by a flood of queries.
5834868825ff05a97b016036	When offloading computation from a mobile device, we show that it can pay to perform additional on-device work in order to reduce the offloading workload. We call this offload shaping, and demonstrate its application at many different levels of abstraction using a variety of techniques. We show that offload shaping can produce significant reduction in resource demand, with little loss of application-level fidelity.
5834868825ff05a97b017026	For k randomly chosen subsets of [n]=\\s {1, 2,…, n\\s} we consider the probability that the Boolean algebra, distributive lattice, and meet semilattice which they generate are respectively free, or all of 2 [n]. In each case we describe a threshold function for the occurrence of these events. The threshold functions for freeness are close to their theoretical maximum values.

5834868825ff05a97b01703f	When astronomers analyze sky images, they need to identify the newly observed celestial objects in the catalog of known objects. We have developed a technique for indexing of astronomical catalogs, which supports fast retrieval of matching catalog objects for every object in new images. It allows processing of a sky image in less than a second, and it scales to catalogs with billions of objects.

58ce2882c50f90cdd388ed89	This paper presents an online optimization-based approach to compute trajectories to enable substitution of robots in formation-based deployments with durations that exceed the energy capacity of individual systems. The proposed algorithm computes trajectories in a multi-robot context to ensure a collision-free exchange, even where congestion is a concern. The quality of the resulting trajectories is determined by the amount of time spent deviating from the original plan while maintaining collision-free, speed-limited polynomial splines.
58c8ac8dc50f90cdd3859833	Current audio analysis techniques rely on fairly shallow analysis of audio content, using symbols or patterns extracted directly from the observed acoustics. We hypothesize that the observed acoustics actually map to semantics in a hierarchical manner, and that the higher levels of this hierarchy correspond to increasingly higher-level semantics. In this paper, we present a model for deeper analysis of the observed acoustics, that induces a probabilistic tree structure depending on estimated constituent identities and contexts.
58c8adcfc50f90cdd38598f7	Spoken user interfaces are conventionally either dialogue-based or menu-based. In this paper we propose a third approach, in which the task of invoking responses from the system is treated as one of retrieval from the set of all possible responses. Unlike conventional spoken user interfaces that return a unique response to the user, the proposed interface returns a shortlist of possible responses, from which the user must make the final selection. We refer to such interfaces as Speech-In List-Out or SILO interfaces.
58c8ae1fc50f90cdd3859927	In this paper, we present our efforts towards deriving vocal tract shapes from ElectroMagnetic Articulograph data (EMA) via geometric adaptation and matching. We describe a novel approach for adapting Maeda's geometric model of the vocal tract to one speaker in the MOCHA database. We show how we can rely solely on the EMA data for adaptation. We present our search technique for the vocal tract shapes that best fit the given EMA data. We then describe our approach of synthesizing speech from these shapes.

58ce116ec50f90cdd388e1b8	Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) generate a wealth of finegrained student interaction data. Although it seems likely that teachers could benefit from access to advanced analytics generated from these data, ITSs do not typically come with dashboards designed for teachers' needs. In this project, we follow a user-centered design approach to create a dashboard for teachers using ITSs.
5834868825ff05a97b016103	The unauthorized copying of movies is a major concern for the motion picture industry. While unauthorized copies of movies have been distributed via portable physical media for some time, low-cost, high-bandwidth Internet connections and peer-to-peer file sharing networks provide highly efficient distribution media.
5834868825ff05a97b016105	PhishGuru is an embedded training system that teaches users to avoid falling for phishing attacks by delivering a training message when the user clicks on the URL in a simulated phishing email. In previous lab and real-world experiments, we validated the effectiveness of this approach. Here, we extend our previous work with a 515-participant, real-world study in which we focus on long-term retention and the effect of two training messages. We also investigate demographic factors that influence training and general phishing susceptibility.
5834868825ff05a97b017d5e	We describe a novel approach for estimating the pitch and yaw of fingers relative to a touchscreen's surface, offering two additional, analog degrees of freedom for interactive functions. Further, we show that our approach can be achieved on off-the-shelf consumer touchscreen devices: a smartphone and smartwatch. We validate our technique though a user study on both devices and conclude with several demo applications that illustrate the value and immediate feasibility of our approach.
58ce2d95c50f90cdd388f04f	This paper presents a grammar diagnostic system for controlled language checking.

58ce2e4cc50f90cdd388f0b3	The three lexicons used by KBMT-89 are described: A concept lexicon constitutes the sublanguage domain model for specifying semantic information; it is maintained by Ontos, a knowledge-acquisition and maintenance system. An analysis lexicon is a dictionary containing syntactic information and mapping rules required for semantic parsing. And a generation lexicon, similar to the analysis lexicon, is employed in the generation phase.

58c8b004c50f90cdd3859a52	In this paper we present an example-driven algorithm that allows the recovery of wide regions of lost spectral components in bandlimited signals. We present a generative spectral model which allows the extraction of salient information from audio snippets, and then apply this information to enhance the bandwidth of bandlimited signals.
58c8b048c50f90cdd3859a7b	In this paper, we present our work using ultrasonic sensing of speech for digit recognition. First, a set of spectral ultrasonic features are developed and tuned in order to achieve optimal performance for the digit recognition task. Using these features, we demonstrate an overall accuracy of 33.00% on a digit recognition task using HMMs with recordings from 6 speakers. The results indicate that ultrasonic sensing of speech is viable, but that further work is needed to achieve word accuracies that match those of audio.

58d03a16c50f90cdd38a138d	Modern scientific applications such as fluid dynamics and earthquake modeling heavily depend on massive volumes of data produced by computer simulations. Such applications require new data management capabilities in order to scale to terabyte-scale data volumes. The most common way to discretize the application domain is to decompose it into pyramids, forming an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. Modern simulations generate meshes of high resolution and precision, to be queried by a visualization or analysis tool.
58d03ae6c50f90cdd38a1424	This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the etree, a database-oriented method for large out-of-core octree mesh generation. The main idea is to map an octree to a database structure and perform all octree operations by querying and updating the database. We apply two standard database techniques, the linear octree and the B-tree, to index and store the octants on disk. Then we introduce two new techniques, auto-navigation and local balancing, to address the special needs of mesh generation.
58d03c8fc50f90cdd38a155e	We present a new methodology for generating and adapting octree meshes for terascale applications. Our approach combines existing methods, such as parallel octree decomposition and space-filling curves, with a set of new methods that address the special needs of parallel octree meshing. We have implemented these techniques in a parallel meshing tool called Octor. Performance evaluations on up to 2000 processors show that Octor has good isogranular scalability, fixed-size scalability, and absolute running time.
58ce3ed6c50f90cdd388f97c	We consider the problem of decomposing a weighted graph with n vertices into a collection P of vertex disjoint clusters such that, for all clusters C ε P, the graph induced by the vertices in C and the edges leaving C, has conductance bounded below by φ. We show that for planar graphs we can compute a decomposition P such that| P|< n/ρ, where ρ is a constant, in O (log n) parallel time with O (n) work. Slightly worse guarantees can be obtained in nearly linear time for graphs that have fixed size minors or bounded genus.
58d04087c50f90cdd38a1845	Aaronson and Drucker (2011) asked whether there exists a quantum finite automaton that can distinguish fair coin tosses from biased ones by spending significantly more time in accepting states, on average, given an infinite sequence of tosses. We answer this question negatively.
58ce3f60c50f90cdd388f9cd	A new parallel algorithm is given to evaluate a straight line program.

58d05b01c50f90cdd38a2b9b	In this study, the stability of conservative spring-mass running using a fixed angle of attack is addressed. For a given initial condition, different angles of attack result in periodic movement patterns. We apply a simple stride-to-stride analysis to prove the stability. Spring-like leg operation together with angle of attack control enables selfstabilised running.
58ce42dfc50f90cdd388fbb4	We present a new algorithm for finding the triconnected components of an undirected graph. The algorithm is based on a method of searching graphs called 'open ear decomposition'. A parallel implementation of the algorithm on a CRCW PRAM runs inO (log 2 n) parallel time usingO (n+m) processors, wheren is the number of vertices andm is the number of edges in the graph.

P is a simple path if: 10,---, v,, _1 are distinct and v1,-~', v,, are distinct. P is a sifnple cycle if it is a simple path and v0= v,,.

58ce373ec50f90cdd388f584	Motivation: While text mining technologies for biomedical research have gained popularity as a way to take advantage of the explosive growth of information in text form in biomedical papers, selecting appropriate natural language processing (NLP) tools is still difficult for researchers who are not familiar with recent advances in NLP. This article provides a comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art natural language parsers, focusing on the task of extracting protein–protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical papers.
5834868825ff05a97b01611a	For many of us, the Internet is a tool, a toy, and a communication channel all rolled up into one. Most of us have never actually seen the Internet, but we've been there. We are familiar with the landscape and we know how to navigate it. We are, by our own declaration, citizens of cyberspace. As students, most of us don't directly pay to use the Internet. Some of us are aware that somep must be paying for it, but that is generally of little concern to us. As far as we are concerned, it is our Internet to do with what we want.
58ccf95bc50f90cdd3885062	Many side-effecting programming activities, such as profiling and tracing, can be formulated as crosscutting concerns and be framed as side-effecting aspects in the aspect-oriented programming paradigm. The benefit gained from this separation of concerns is particularly evident in purely functional programming, as adding such aspects using techniques such as monadification will generally lead to crosscutting...

While it is important to present good work at a poster session, even the most outstanding research projects will receive little attention if they are not presented well. This article provides a guide to creating and presenting an attractive and informative research poster.
58d06f1ec50f90cdd38a3a25	Inspired by work in semi-conservative collection, we have implemented a mostly-copying collector for an object-oriented language, including support for object pinning. Our collector efficiently manages fragmentation by measuring page residency and determining where copying can be most effective. This work in progress will form the foundation of our ongoing work in real-time collection.
58ce4491c50f90cdd388fc9f	We present a new algorithm for finding the tri-connected components of an undirected graph. The algorithm is based on ear decomposition and has linear sequential running time. It also has a parallel implementation on a CRCW PRAM with O (log 2 n) parallel time using a linear number of processors, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. This is the first efficient parallel algorithm for graph tri-connectivity.
58ce458dc50f90cdd388fd28	In this paper we describe a simple parallel algorithm for list ranking. The algorithm is deterministic and runs inO (logn) time on an EREW PRAM withn/logn processors.

58d09d00c50f90cdd38a5ba3	When model-checking reports that a property holds on a model, vacuity detection increases user confidence in this result by checking that the property is satisfied in the intended way. While vacuity detection is effective, it is a relatively expensive technique requiring many additional model-checking runs.

58d09d29c50f90cdd38a5bbf	Computing minimal (or even just small) certificates is a central problem in automated reasoning and, in particular, in automated formal verification. For example, Minimal Unsatisfiable Subsets (MUSes) have a wide range of applications in verification ranging from abstraction and generalization to vacuity detection and more. In this paper, we study the problem of computing minimal certificates for...
58d09e2fc50f90cdd38a5c7f	Recursive relational specifications are commonly used to describe the computational structure of formal systems. Recent research in proof theory has identified two features that facilitate direct, logic-based reasoning about such descriptions: the interpretation of atomic judgments through recursive definitions and an encoding of binding constructs via generic judgments. However, logics encompassing...

58cf562cc50f90cdd3898a73	A system for color correction has been designed, built, and tested successfully; the essential components are three custom chips built using subthreshold analog CMOS VLSI. The system, based on Land's Retinex theory of color constancy, produces colors similar in many respects to those produced by the visual system.

58d0ae55c50f90cdd38a6853	Distributed applications are difficult to program reliably and securely. Dependently typed functional languages promise to prevent broad classes of errors and vulnerabilities, and to enable program verification to proceed side-by-side with development. However, as recursion, effects, and rich libraries are added, using types to reason about programs, specifications, and proofs becomes challenging. We present F*, a full-fledged design and implementation of a new dependently typed language for secure distributed programming.

58cfeca2c50f90cdd389db01	This paper discusses the issues that will need to be solved in order to provide an effective keyword search capability on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. We argue that issues in three main areas—scalability, security, and search result quality—must be addressed. For some of these issues we are able to propose specific solutions or approaches. Other issues are identified as open problems.
58cfeef1c50f90cdd389dcab	This paper evaluates the performance of the Jini toolkit for a distributed le system service. We compare the performance of the Andrew le system (AFS) with the Ji y le system, a prototype Jini-based le system developed at Carnegie Mellon. Our results show that the performance of the Jini-based system is comparable to AFS, thus providing some evidence that Jini has the potential to be a useful tool for building real-world distributed services.
58cff42bc50f90cdd389e091	As described in CS: APP3e Section 3. 1, Intel introduced the SSE instructions in 1999, where SSE is the acronym for “streaming extensions,” and, in turn, SIMD (pronounced “sim-dee”) is the acronym for “singleinstruction, multiple-data.” implement the AVX multimedia instructions. In addition to providing a superset of the SSE instructions Our presentation is based on AVX2, the second version of AVX, introduced with the Core i7 Haswell processor in 2013. GCC will generate AVX2 code when given the command-line parameter-mavx2.
58cff478c50f90cdd389e0cd	There are several clever ways to determine the two's complement negation of a value represented at the bit level. These techniques are both useful, such as when one encounters the value 0xfffffffa when debugging a program, and they lend insight into the nature of the two's complement representation.
58d01ba5c50f90cdd389fd5b	This paper contributes to a growing body of evidence that—when coupled with appropriate machine-learning techniques—linguistically motivated, information-rich representations can outperform one-hot encodings of linguistic data. In particular, we show that phonological features outperform character-based models using the PanPhon resource. PanPhon is a database relating over 5,000 IPA segments to 21 subsegmental articulatory features. We show that this database boosts performance in various NER-related tasks.
58d02624c50f90cdd38a0503	This article presents a number of complementary algorithms for detecting faults on-board operating robots, where a fault is defined as a deviation from expected behavior. The algorithms focus on faults that cannot directly be detected from current sensor values but require inference from a sequence of time-varying sensor values. Each algorithm provides an independent improvement over the basic approach. These improvements are not mutually exclusive, and the algorithms may be combined to suit the application domain.
58d04866c50f90cdd38a1e15	The supplementary material is organized as follows. In section 1, we provide an illustration of the model (section 1.1), the derivation of the Gibbs sampler (section 1.2) and the gradient descent updating rule (section 1.3). Section 2 gives more details on the feature design and extraction. As supplementary to the paper, section 3 discloses more implementation details for reproducibility, including the word embedding training (section 3.1) and discussion on the implementation efficiency (section 3.2).
58d04deec50f90cdd38a2209	Define a hierarchy as a set of nodes N={1, 2...} with the parent relationship π: N→ N where π (n) is the parent of node n∈ N. Let D={(xi, ti)} N i= 1 denote the training data where xi∈ Rd is an instance, ti∈ T is a label, where T⊂ N is the set of leaf nodes in the hierarchy labeled from 1 to| T|. We assume that each instance is assigned to one of the leaf nodes in the hierarchy. Let Cn be the set of all children of node n.
58d0544cc50f90cdd38a269b	A central question in locomotion research is to understand how leg movements are generated. Experimental and analytical approaches to reveal basic mechanisms for stable leg operation in running and hopping advert that leg forces during contact increase with the amount of leg shortening similar to a mechanical spring.
58d05be5c50f90cdd38a2c47	We present a feedforward control for spring-legged systems in uneven terrain which keeps the running speed constant. The control uses the unique transformation between ground level and flight time to automatically adapt the system parameters during flight to the actual ground level without having to detect it. We further demonstrate how this control for constant speed running can simultaneously be combined with other control strategies in spring-legged systems to adapt their behavior to a desired locomotion task.
58d067bcc50f90cdd38a34bc	Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for acquiring a signal to noise ratio (SNR), a signal receiving device and a signal sending device. Through the embodiments of the present invention, an SNR of the signal receiving device (ie, a receiving end) can satisfy the setting requirement, that is, the test condition that an SNR does not contain a precoding gain, so that a subsequent test is valid.
58d07156c50f90cdd38a3bd0	The connection between polymorphic and dynamic typing was originally considered by Curry et al.(1972) in the form of “polymorphic type assignment” for untyped λ-terms. Types are assigned after the fact to what is, in modern terminology, a dynamic language. Interest in type assignment was revitalized by the proposals of Bracha et al.(1998) and Bank et al.(1997) to enrich Java with polymorphism (generics), which in turn sparked the development of other languages, such as Scala, with similar combinations of features.
5834868825ff05a97b0161a3	Computer security and privacy is concerned with the design, implementation, and analysis of mechanisms intended to guarantee that desired policies (or properties) hold in the presence of malicious adversaries. In this article some logical methods for reasoning about system security and for enforcing security and privacy policies are discussed.

5834868825ff05a97b01717c	DiscFinder is a scalable approach for identifying large-scale astronomical structures, such as galaxy clusters, in massive observation and simulation astrophysics datasets. It is designed to operate on datasets with tens of billions of astronomical objects, even in the case when the dataset is much larger than the aggregate memory of compute cluster used for the processing.
5834868825ff05a97b0173ef	Polynomial-time approximation algorithms with non-trivial performance guarantees are presented for the problems of (a) partitioning the vertices of a weighted graph into k blocks so as to maximise the weight of crossing edges, and (b) partitioning the vertices of a weighted graph into two blocks of equal cardinality, again so as to maximise the weight of crossing edges. The approach, pioneered by Goemans and Williamson, is via a semidefinite programming relaxation.
5834868825ff05a97b0173f3	We describe a simple heuristic for determining the p-centre of a finite set of weighted points in an arbitrary metric space. The computational effort is O (np) for an n-point set. We show that the ratio of the objective function value of the heuristic solution to that of the optimum is bounded by min (3, 1+ α), where α is the maximum weight divided by the minimum weight of points in the set.
5834868825ff05a97b017414	We initiate the study of privacy in pharmacogenetics, wherein machine learning models are used to guide medical treatments based on a patient's genotype and background. Performing an in-depth case study on privacy in personalized warfarin dosing, we show that suggested models carry privacy risks, in particular because attackers can perform what we call model inversion: an attacker, given the model and some demographic information about a patient, can predict the patient's genetic markers.
5834868825ff05a97b017523	The Feedback Vertex Set problem (FVS), where the goal is to find a small subset of vertices that intersects every cycle in an input directed graph, is among the fundamental problems whose approximability is not well understood. One can efficiently find an O (logn)-factor approximation, and efficient constant-factor approximation is ruled out under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). We give a simpler proof that Feedback Vertex Set is hard to approximate within any constant factor, assuming UGC.
5834868825ff05a97b017527	We give a concrete example of a family of natural graph-theoretic problems which behave better and better with respect to approximability but none of which are likely to admit a polynomial time approximation scheme. More specifically, the family exhibits problems with arbitrarily small, yet positive (assuming P≠ NP), approximation thresholds. The family of problems we give is the independent set problem on k-iterated total graphs,∀ k⩽ 1.
5834868825ff05a97b017528	We show that all algebraic-geometric codes possess a succinct representation that allows for the list decoding algorithms of [15, 7] to run in polynomial time. We do this by presenting a root-finding algorithm for univariate polynomials over function fields when their coefficients lie in finite-dimensional linear spaces, and proving that there is a polynomial size representation given which the root finding algorithm runs in polynomial time.
5834868825ff05a97b01752b	This is a brief survey into the applications of list decoding in complexity theory, specifically in relating the worst-case and average-case complexity of computational problems, and in construction of pseudorandom generators. Since we do not have space for full proofs, the aim is to give a flavor of the utility of list decoding in these settings together with pointers to where further details can be found.
5834868825ff05a97b016210	This paper casts an architectural eye at existing work on security and privacy in mobile computing. Specifically, it focuses on authentication as it leads up to access control from two points of view: servicer providers granting access to users, and users granting access to service providers. The paper identifies three classes of problems addressed by existing work. Then, it teases out architectural patterns being used to address those problems, their assumptions, properties, and remaining challenges.
58d0a162c50f90cdd38a5ec7	Summmary We propose a primitive, called Pioneer, as a first step towards verifiable code execution on untrusted legacy hosts. Pioneer does not require any hardware support such as secure co-processors or CPU-architecture extensions. We implement Pioneer on an Intel Pentiurn IV Xeon processor. Pioneer can be used as a basic building block to build security systems. We demonstrate this by building a kernel rootkit detector.

In this paper we explore their potential in ophthalmologic studies. While the vast majority of applications of autostereoscopic displays in other fields is merely based on producing 3D viewing effects, we can distinguish between several classes of...
5834868825ff05a97b017536	We prove the following results concerning the combinatorics of list decoding, motivated by the exponential gap between the known upper bound (of O (1/γ)) and lower bound (of Ωp (log (1/γ))) for the list-size needed to decode up to radius p with rate γ away from capacity, ie, 1− h (p)− γ (here p∈(0, 1/2) and γ> 0).
5834868825ff05a97b017b80	This paper describes the implementation of a topic labeling component for the Informedia Digital Video Library. Each news story recorded from the evening news is assigned to one of 3178 topic categories using a K-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. In preliminary tests, the system achieved recall of 0.49 1 with relevance of 0.482 when up to 5 topics could be assigned to a news story.
5834868825ff05a97b017b98	We describe the Informediam News-on-Demand system. News-on-Demand is an innovative example of indexing and searching broadcast video and audio material by text content. The fully-automatic system monitors TV news and allows selective rerneval of news items based on spoken queries. The user then plays the appropriate video “paragraph”. The system runs on a Pentium PC using MPEG-I video compression and the Sphinx-II continuous speech recogmtion system [6].
5834868825ff05a97b017c13	Coordination of engineering decisions is a central concern of software engineering. We present a theory in which coordination of engineering decisions is modeled as a distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP). We derive six hypotheses, predicting how the distribution of decisions over developers and the density of constraints among decisions will affect development time, probability that a file contains a field defect, and developer productivity. We test these hypotheses using data from a commercial project.
5834868825ff05a97b017c17	In this paper, we examined the impact of project-level configurational choices of globally distributed software teams on project productivity, quality, and profits. Our analysis used data from 362 projects of four different firms. These projects spanned a wide range of programming languages, application domain, process choices, and development sites spread over 15 countries and 5 continents. Our analysis revealed fundamental tradeoffs in choosing configurational choices that are optimized for productivity, quality, and/or profits.
5834868825ff05a97b017b48	The Informedia Digital Video Library user interface summarizes query results with a collage of representative keyframes. We present a user study in which keyframe occlusion caused difficulties. To use the screen space most efficiently to display images, both occlusion and wasted whitespace should be minimized. Thus optimal choices will tend toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and empty space if the density is not uniform.
58d0fba7c50f90cdd38a9551	The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma shows that a set of n points in high dimensional Euclidean space can be mapped down into an O (log n= 2) dimensional Euclidean space such that the distance between any two points changes by only a factor of (1). In this note, we prove this lemma using elementary probabilistic techniques.

58c8f8c6c50f90cdd385c52a	We present a tecchnique for denoising speech using temporally regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). In previous work [1], we used a regularized NMF update to impose structure within each audio frame. In this paper, we add frameto-frame regularization across time and show that this additional regularization can also improve our speech denoising results. We evaluate our algorithm on a range of nonstationary noise types and outperform a state-of-the-art Wiener filter implementation.
5834868825ff05a97b0161fd	Prior laboratory studies have shown that PhishGuru, an embedded training system, is an effective way to teach users to identify phishing scams. PhishGuru users are sent simulated phishing attacks and trained after they fall for the attacks. In this current study, we extend the PhishGuru methodology to train users about spear phishing and test it in a real world setting with employees of a Portuguese company. Our results demonstrate that the findings of PhishGuru laboratory studies do indeed hold up in a real world deployment.
58d09251c50f90cdd38a53f8	An (n, M) vector code C⊆ 𝔽 n is a collection of M codewords where n elements (from the field 𝔽) in each of the codewords are referred to as code blocks. Assuming that 𝔽≅ 𝔹 &ell;, the code blocks are treated as &ell;-length vectors over the base field 𝔹. Equivalently, the code is said to have the sub-packetization level &ell;. This paper addresses the problem of constructing MDS vector codes which enable exact reconstruction of each code block by downloading small amount of information from the remaining code blocks.
58d040d6c50f90cdd38a1880	The population recovery problem is a basic problem in noisy unsupervised learning that has attracted significant research attention in recent years [WY12, DRWY12, MS13, BIMP13, LZ15, DST16]. A number of different variants of this problem have been studied, often under assumptions on the unknown distribution (such as that it has restricted support size). In this work we study the sample complexity and algorithmic complexity of the most general version of the problem, under both bit-flip noise and erasure noise model.
58c91b0fc50f90cdd385da00	We present a method for learning bilingual translation lexicons from monolingual corpora. Word types in each language are characterized by purely monolingual features, such as context counts and orthographic substrings. Translations are induced using a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis, which explains the monolingual lexicons in terms of latent matchings. We show that high-precision lexicons can be learned in a variety of language pairs and from a range of corpus types.
5834868825ff05a97b01621f	An object-oriented approach is proposed for graphical interface design, namely for the description of typical entities such as windows and input devices, as well as for the modeling of user dialogues. An outline of the approach is presented providing the reader with the main concepts and techniques. A discussion is also included on how to achieve the prototyping of such object-oriented interface applications.
58d081cbc50f90cdd38a47cd	The non-interference (NI) property defines a program to be secure if changes to high-security inputs cannot alter the values of low-security outputs. NI indirectly states the epistemic property that no lowsecurity principal acquires knowledge of high-security data. We consider a directly epistemic account of information flow (IF) security focusing on the knowledge flows engendered by the program's execution. Storage effects are of primary interest, since principals acquire knowledge from the execution only through these effects.
58d0821bc50f90cdd38a4807	Type theory is a logical formalism that is rich enough to express complex mathematical and computational assertions. In this project, Avigad and Harper developed type-theoretic algorithms and formalisms that can support the development of secure and reusable software libraries, as well as the development of methods of automated reasoning in mathematics and libraries of mathematical knowledge.
5834868825ff05a97b0161ad	Securing computer systems has traditionally been the domain of system administrators using technology to protect computer systems from attack. However, in many systems, human users are critical to the security process. There's a growing realization that technology alone can't protect security if users don't properly deploy and utilize it. Ultimately, it's users who create passwords and choose whether to adhere to security procedures.
5834868825ff05a97b0161ae	Although many users create predictable passwords, the extent to which users realize these passwords are predictable is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between users' perceptions of the strength of specific passwords and their actual strength. In this 165-participant online study, we ask participants to rate the comparative security of carefully juxtaposed pairs of passwords, as well as the security and memorability of both existing passwords and common password-creation strategies.
5834868825ff05a97b0161e2	In this paper, we present data from 31 semi-structured interviews with anti-phishing experts from academia, law enforcement, and industry. Our analysis led to eight key findings and 18 recommendations to improve phishing countermeasures. Our findings describe the evolving phishing threat, stakeholder incentives to devote resources to anti-phishing efforts, what stakeholders should do to most effectively address the problem, and the role of education and law enforcement.

We show that both link layer...
58d08b4cc50f90cdd38a4edf	We propose a crowdsourcing-based framework to iteratively and rapidly bootstrap a dialog system from scratch for a new domain. We leverage the open-source modular HALEF dialog system to deploy dialog applications. We illustrate the usefulness of this framework using four different prototype dialog items with applications in the educational domain and present initial results and insights from this endeavor.
5834868825ff05a97b0161e8	Policies that address security and privacy are pervasive parts of both technical and social systems, and technology that enables both organizations and individuals to create and manage such policies is a critical need in information technology (IT). This paper describes the notion of end-to-end policy management and advances a framework that can be useful in understanding the commonality in IT security and privacy policy management.
58d08b7fc50f90cdd38a4f06	This paper proposes a new approach to beat detection and prediction in music. Recurrent timing networks are used to detect and predict periodicities in an onset stream and are contained within nodes that compete for selection as the best beat hypothesis. Beat prediction nodes perform period self adjustment to better represent the detected music beat period. The system is tested using a variety of music from different genres and shows promise, in many cases with high correct beat detection percentages.
58d08b9cc50f90cdd38a4f1d	A recent SIGACT News Logic column, guest-written by James Cheney DOI= 10.1145/1107523.1107537, discussed nominal logic [1], an approach to abstract syntax with binding structure. In addition to providing a worthy tutorial on nominal logic, that column leveled five criticisms at higher-order abstract syntax, an alternative approach for dealing with binding structure in abstract syntax. We argue below that three of those criticisms are factually inaccurate, and the other two are misguided.
58d08be4c50f90cdd38a4f52	This paper describes the design of a protocol stack implemented in Standard ML. Standard ML's signatures are a language construct which can be used to specify or constrain the interface of a module. The design includes both a generic signature which generalizes all the protocol modules, and individual signatures specific to each protocol module. The specific signatures all inherit from the generic signature. The implementation of each protocol is parametrized, so protocols can be composed into custom protocol stacks.

58c8fbbfc50f90cdd385c700	Purpose A need exists for improvement in the perception of forces by the sense of touch when using tools to perform delicate procedures. This is especially crucial in microsurgery, where surgeons routinely repair tiny blood vessels under a microscope that are far too delicate to be felt by the hand of the surgeon, and ophthalmological surgery where delicate membranes are peeled off the retina using visual feedback alone.
58c8fbe3c50f90cdd385c717	We present a technique for denoising speech using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) in combination with statistical speech and noise models. We compare our new technique to standard NMF and to a state-of-the-art Wiener filter implementation and show improvements in speech quality across a range of interfering noise types.
58d0f757c50f90cdd38a933b	The UNIQUE GAMES problem is the following: we are given a graph G=(V, E), with each edge e=(u, v) having a weight we and a permutation π uv on [k]. The objective is to find a labeling of each vertex u with a label fu∈[k] to minimize the weight of unsatisfied edges---where an edge (u, v) is satisfied if fv= π uv (fu). The Unique Games Conjecture of Khot [8] essentially says that for each ε> 0, there is ak such that it is NP-hard to distinguish instances of Unique games with (1-ε) satisfiable edges from those with only ε satisfiable edges.
58d0fa84c50f90cdd38a94c2	We present constant-factor approximation algorithms for several widely-studied NP-hard optimization problems in network design, including the multicommodity rent-or-buy, virtual private network design, and single-sink buy-at-bulk problems. Our algorithms are simple and their approximation ratios improve over those previously known, in some cases by orders of magnitude.
5834868825ff05a97b016246	Abstract—We take the position that audit mechanisms are essential for privacy protection in healthcare environments. Although audits are used in practice and commercial tools that provide assistance for audits are emerging, we currently lack rigorous models and definitions of properties that can guide the design of appropriate audit mechanisms. We report on our recent result that presents a principled learning-theoretic approach to audits with the goal of stimulating discussion and additional research on this problem.
5834868825ff05a97b01624c	An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user's password can mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses. This offline attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password. Key-stretching techniques like hash iteration and memory hard functions have been proposed to mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify.
58c94138c50f90cdd385f0d6	Our challenge to the research community is to make location-enhanced web services valuable and readily accessible to a very large number of people in daily, real world, situations.

5834868825ff05a97b017d7d	We present acoustic barcodes, structured patterns of physical notches that, when swiped with eg, a fingernail, produce a complex sound that can be resolved to a binary ID. A single, inexpensive contact microphone attached to a surface or object is used to capture the waveform. We present our method for decoding sounds into IDs, which handles variations in swipe velocity and other factors. Acoustic barcodes could be used for information retrieval or to triggering interactive functions. They are passive, durable and inexpensive to produce.

In hopes of furthering debate on key issues, we explain some central questions about the role, purpose, and policies associated with these systems. We also propose a framework for addressing policy questions and candidate technology that we believe may sharpen policy discussion and allow PHR systems to adhere to policies they adopt.

58c94b36c50f90cdd385f6ad	Two new architectures are proposed for designing physical network nodes in packet-switched structures. They allow transparent optical packet networking and are based on the association of various subsystems, which have previously been proposed, and demonstrated. These elements are mainly based on the application of nonlinear behavior in semiconductor optical amplifiers.
58c94bd2c50f90cdd385f70c	We experimentally demonstrate the high-speed data processing capabilities of a GaInNAsSb semiconductor optical amplifier operating at 1.55 μm. The investigated structure exhibits good thermal characteristics and fast gain dynamics with 10%-90% recovery time of 55 ps. Successful wavelength conversion of 10-Gb/s signals is reported. A maximum power penalty of<; 2.4 dB for return to zero formatting and of 1.9 dB for nonreturn to zero is demonstrated.
58c94c41c50f90cdd385f750	In this paper we address the issue of Computer Vision in Antarctica for robot navigation by analysing images collected at Patriot Hills, Antarctica in the Fall of 1998. Conditions produced by polar weather and terrain are unique and challenging for perception equipment and computer vision algorithms. The later aspect will be studied here through the evaluation of a colour segmentation algorithm, a stereovision algorithm and a feature points detector and tracker algorithm.
58c94c5bc50f90cdd385f760	The Life In The Atacama (LITA) project develops and field tests a long-range, solarpowered, automated rover platform (Zo) and a science payload assembled to search for microbial life in the Atacama desert. Life is barely detectable over most of the driest desert on Earth. Its unique geological, climatic, and biological evolution have created a unique training site for designing and testing exploration strategies and life detection methods for the robotic search for life on Mars.
58c94c99c50f90cdd385f788	We present a new scheme for all-optical contention detection and time-domain contention resolution of optical packets in label-switched routers that employ all-optical label recognition. The contention detection subsystem provides all the necessary control signals required to drive an optically controlled buffer which employs 1 times 2 optical switching elements and an optical fiber delay line. The state of the buffer is dynamically controlled on a per-packet basis with all the decisions and processing performed in the optical domain.
5834868825ff05a97b01626c	We introduce a basic framework for deriving security protocols from simple components, like proofs are derived from axioms. As an initial case study, we derive the recently proposed key agreement protocol JFK (Just Fast Keying), starting from the basic Diffie-Hellman exchange, and the generic challenge-response scheme, and refining them by the other required security features, formalized in our derivation system by suitable refinement and transformation rules.
58c94cfdc50f90cdd385f7c4	A Bayes network based classifier for distinguishing terrestrial rocks from meteorites is implemented onboard the Nomad robot. Equipped with a camera, spectrometer and eddy current sensor, this robot searched the ice sheets of Antarctica and autonomously made the first robotic identification of a meteorite, in January 2000 at the Elephant Moraine. This paper discusses rock classification from a robotic platform, and describes the system onboard Nomad.
58c94d50c50f90cdd385f7f8	We demonstrate the cascaded operation of an all-optical 2R burst-mode regenerator consisting of a single Mach-Zehnder interferometer, using a loop configuration that introduces a 6-dB power variation on each recirculation of the data. The device is shown to regenerate error-free 10-Gb/s data streams for up to six successive loop recirculations.
58c94d7ac50f90cdd385f810	We demonstrate an all-optical four-wavelength 3R burst mode regenerator, operating error-free with variable length data packets that exhibit 6-dB packet-to-packet power variation. The circuit was implemented using a sequence of three integrated quad MZI arrays.
5834868825ff05a97b016272	A unified view of a wide range of adversary classes and composition principles for reasoning about security properties of systems are cornerstones of a science of security.

5834868825ff05a97b016b57	A chip-scale tri-axial CMOS-MEMS high-g accelerometer is demonstrated. The accelerometer uses an array of cantilever structures, electrically connected in parallel for capacitive sensing. The measured sensitivity is 3.02 muV/g for in-plane motion and 9.91 muV/g for out-of-plane motion. CMOS-MEMS integration allows the sensor to be lower in weight and volume than existing non-integrated piezoresistive and piezoelectric high-g accelerometers.
5834868825ff05a97b016b62	Low power RF operation is often limited by the poor quality factor of the passives available in silicon-based processes. This paper reports on an LC-tank VCO, incorporating micromachined inductors and capacitors, for low power operation, without sacrificing performance. Only 2.75 mW of power is needed to achieve-122 dB/Hz phase noise at 1 MHz from a 2.84 GHz carrier.
5834868825ff05a97b016b6b	A novel MEMS-based electrostatic actuator design is proposed for recording head fly height control below 10 nm. Different from prior work on MEMS-based electrostatic microactuators designed for magnetic hard disk drives (HDD), the proposed microactuator is fabricated monolithically with a conventional head/slider design. The actuator is micromachined into the same side as the head element on a slider with a modified CMOS-MEMS process. It has an extremely small size, light weight and a very simple structure.
5834868825ff05a97b016b81	Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses, that propagate over a social or other network. Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition: if a user buys product'A'(or gets infected with virus' X'), she will never buy product'B'(or virus' Y'). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers.
5834868825ff05a97b016b91	Will we ever have a theory of data mining analogous to the relational algebra in databases? Why do we have so many clearly different clustering algorithms? Could data mining be automated? We show that the answer to all these questions is negative, because data mining is closely related to compression and Kolmogorov complexity; and the latter is undecidable. Therefore, data mining will always be an art, where our goal will be to find better models (patterns) that fit our datasets as best as possible.

58c8a411c50f90cdd3859305	Secure multiparty computation allows for a set of users to evaluate a particular function over their inputs without revealing the information they possess to each other. Theoretically, this can be achieved using fully homomorphic encryption systems, but so far they remain in the realm of computational impracticability. An alternative is to consider secure function evaluation using homomorphic public-key cryptosystems or Garbled Circuits, the latter being a popular trend in recent times due to important breakthroughs.

5834868825ff05a97b0166c5	In this note, we describe Spark, an informative art display that visualizes physical activity using abstract art. We present results from five deployments, lasting two to three weeks, that suggest that while graph visualizations are useful for information seeking, abstract visualizations are preferred for display purposes. Our results show that informative art is an appropriate way to visualize physical activity, and can be used in addition to graphs to increase enjoyment and engagement with physical activity displays.
5834868825ff05a97b0166c7	The majority of smart home research has focused on novel technical artifacts, but has overlooked the issues surrounding social relationships in the home. We argue in favor of research that is sensitive to and functions within the social constraints of dual income family homes. This paper describes our grounded contextual fieldwork with real families in their homes, and identifies socially-aware concepts smart home systems will need to address.
5834868825ff05a97b0166c8	The CyberDesk project suggests a way to break the prevailing assumption in personal computing that the user must search out ways to integrate behavior between separate services. We present a technique and prototype system for automatic integration of desktop applications and network services that requires no effortby either the designer or the end-user.
5834868825ff05a97b016772	CMOS-MEMS probes have the ability to interact with external surfaces mechanically and electrically through their conductive tips. Using only the electrothermal actuator of the probe, micro-Newton forces can be applied to make active probe contact with a conductive substrate. Measured cyclic contact resistance has a mean value of 7.4 kΩ and a standard deviation of 11.3 kΩ over 2450 cycles. When the probe actuator is repeatedly turned off, mechanical and electrical contacts are successfully disconnected.
58cfe7d8c50f90cdd389d78f	We propose a fast, simple low-rank method for solving the SDP relaxation of Maxcut problem, in which the complexity per iteration is linear in the number of edges. Experiments suggest that it always converges to global optima and is orders of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art low-rank methods. Specially, the proposed method is capable of solving problems involving millions of vertices.
5834868825ff05a97b01677c	Given a large social graph, what can we say about its robustness? Broadly speaking, the property of robustness is crucial in real graphs, since it is related to the structural behavior of graphs to retain their connectivity properties after losing a portion of their edges/nodes. Can we estimate a robustness index for a graph quickly? Additionally, if the graph evolves over time, how this property changes? In this work, we are trying to answer the above questions studying the expansion properties of large social graphs.
58cfefb1c50f90cdd389dd3b	We introduce an efficient method for computing matrix products of the formY= AXB, whereA andB are sparse and constant.

58cfefb2c50f90cdd389dd3e	Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) generate a wealth of finegrained student interaction data. Although it seems likely that teachers could benefit from access to advanced analytics generated from these data, ITSs do not typically come with dashboards designed for teachers' needs. In this project, we follow a user-centered design approach to create a dashboard for teachers using ITSs.
58d0075bc50f90cdd389eec7	This paper investigates an applicability of the discrete action set DCOB proposed by Yamaguchi et al. to motion acquisition task of an actual small size multi-link robot by reinforcement learning. We apply the DCOB to a crawling task of a spider robot (ROBOTIS Bioloid), and compare the DCOB with a grid action set as a conventional method. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the DCOB both in learning speed and ability to acquire performance.
5834868825ff05a97b016be0	This paper describes assessment efforts currently under way in France. Since many aspects are still being worked on, the information is being communicated in the hope that it may spur international cooperation, which is essential to any future assessment effort. The main effort detailed here concerns the content of a recently proposed French AFNOR standard for recognizer assessment that makes use of elements which are or will soon be available from separate GRECO, SAM, and DARPA projects.

5834868825ff05a97b016bf8	This paper targets an understanding of how metadiscourse functions in spoken language. Starting from a metadiscourse taxonomy, a set of TED talks is annotated via crowdsourcing and then a lexical grade level predictor is used to map the distribution of the distinct discourse functions of the taxonomy across levels. The paper concludes showing how speakers use these functions in presentational settings.
5834868825ff05a97b016d99	We present a compiler for machines with an explicitly managed memory hierarchy and suggest that a primary role of any compiler for such architectures is to manipulate and schedule a hierarchy of bulk operations at varying scales of the application and of the machine. We evaluate the performance of our compiler using several benchmarks running on a Cell processor.
5834868825ff05a97b016da7	In this paper we describe a message server facility for handling large organizational archives of messages in an office information system environment. Messages can be retrieved according to attribute values specified and to some pattern of words appearing in the text of the message. We discuss design decisions and performance considerations in this environment and we derive analytic formulas for the optimal choice of the parameters of the message file organization.
58cfeaf5c50f90cdd389d9ce	Arabic writing is typically underspecified for short vowels and other markups, referred to as diacritics. In addition to the lexical ambiguity exhibited in most languages, the lack of diacritics in written Arabic adds another layer of ambiguity which is an artifact of the orthography. In this paper, we present the details of three annotation experimental conditions designed to study the impact of automatic ambiguity detection, on annotation speed and quality in a large scale annotation project.
58cb6a3fc50f90cdd3875a25	Locating the patient accurately in real time is necessary for many medical robotics applications. Current solutions are expensive or inconvenient.

We compute the locations of target features in the ultrasonic images relative to the CT reference features.
58cc8b17c50f90cdd388158e	This paper describes a multi-site project to annotate the interlingual content of six sizable bilingual parallel corpora. The project addresses several principal problems in parallel: specification of interlingua content and notation, development of reliable annotation methods, and evaluation of annotated corpora. As a by-product, a growing corpus of annotated texts is being produced, which may eventually be useful for machine learning of semantics-based processing.
58cc8b3cc50f90cdd38815a4	In this paper we adopt a constraint-based representation of time, Time Calculus (TC), for anchoring temporal expressions in a novel genre, emails. Email is sufficiently different from the most studied genre-newswire texts, and its highly under-specified nature fits well with our representation. The evaluation of our anchoring system shows that it performs significantly better than the baseline, and the result compares favorably with some of the closest related work.
58cd9521c50f90cdd388a0be	Three-dimensional ICs are emerging to overcome scaling challenges in 2D ICs. Long interconnects are reduced by shorter vertical connections, called Through Silicon Vias (TSV) s. However, TSVs incur costs in area and yield. In this paper, a TSV multiplexing scheme, for scan chains and functional path, is proposed to reduce the number of TSVs. Experiments on ISCAS89 and ITC99 Benchmark circuits indicate that on an average TSV area has reduced by 8-9%, with 3.28% impact on the scan chain wire length.
58cd9725c50f90cdd388a1c8	Many applications require teams of robots to cooperatively execute tasks. Among these domains are those in which successful coordination must respect intra-path constraints, which are constraints that occur on the paths of agents and affect route planning. This work focuses on multi-agent coordination for disaster response with intra-path precedence constraints, a compelling application that is not...
58c87309c50f90cdd38575b9	Most current automatic speech recognition systems based on HMMs cluster or tie together subsets of the subword units with which speech is represented. This tying improves recognition accuracy when systems are trair1ed with limited data, and is performed by classifying the sub-phonetic units using a series of binary tests based on speech production, called “linguistic questions”. This paper describes a new method for automatically determining the best combinations of subword units to form these questions.
58d0230ec50f90cdd38a02bb	Enabling computational agents to efficiently aid or automate negotiations with humans requires a recognition and understanding of differences in negotiation behavior. One important dimension of these differences is based on the cultures of the negotiators. In this work, we investigate two tasks needed to enable culturally-sensitive computational negotiation agents:(1) the identification of negotiators' cultures from observed negotiation transcripts, and (2) the prediction of culturally-based differences in negotiation outcomes.

58d068d4c50f90cdd38a358c	Membrane-bound organelles are biochemically distinct compartments used by eukaryotic cells for serving specialized physiological functions and for organizing their internal environment. Recent studies revealed extensive communication between these organelles through mechanisms such as membrane contacts and highlighted the network nature of their organization and communication. Currently, however, how the organelle networks are spatially organized and interact at the whole-cell scale remains poorly understood.

5834868825ff05a97b016dd4	We survey the major techniques for information retrieval. In the first part, we provide an overview of the traditional ones (full text scanning, inversion, signature files and clustering). In the second part we discuss attempts to include semantic information (natural language processing, latent semantic indexing and neural networks).
5834868825ff05a97b016e43	This paper describes (very briefly) a parallel hardware implementation for NETL-type semantic network memories. A million-element system can be built with about 7000 IC chips, including 4000 64K RAM chips. This compares favorably with the hardware cost of holding the same body of knowledge in a standard computer memory, and offers significant advantages in flexibility of access and the speed of performing certain searches and deductions.
5834868825ff05a97b016e6d	This paper describes the integration of multimedia documents in the Portuguese version of REAP, a tutoring system for vocabulary learning. The documents result from the pipeline processing of Broadcast News videos that automatically segments the audio files, transcribes them, adds punctuation and capitalization, and breaks them into stories classified by topics. The integration of these materials in REAP was done in a way that tries to decrease the impact of potential errors of the automatic chain in the learning process.
5834868825ff05a97b016e6f	We present an application of Latent Semantic Analysis to word sense discrimination within a tutor for English vocabulary learning. We attempt to match the meaning of a word in a document with the meaning of the same word in a fill-in-the-blank question. We compare the performance of the Lesk algorithm to Latent Semantic Analysis. We also compare the performance of Latent Semantic Analysis on a set of words with several unrelated meanings and on a set of words having both related and unrelated meanings.
5834868825ff05a97b016eaf	This paper introduces the Finite-State Turn-Taking Machine (FSTTM), a new model to control the turn-taking behavior of conversational agents. Based on a non-deterministic finite-state machine, the FSTTM uses a cost matrix and decision theoretic principles to select a turn-taking action at any time. We show how the model can be applied to the problem of end-of-turn detection. Evaluation results on a deployed spoken dialog system show that the FSTTM provides significantly higher responsiveness than previous approaches.
5834868825ff05a97b016eb2	This paper describes our work with Let's Go, a telephonebased bus schedule information system that has been in use by the Pittsburgh population since March 2005. Results from several studies show that while task success correlates strongly with speech recognition accuracy, other aspects of dialogue such as turn-taking, the set of error recovery strategies, and the initiative style also significantly impact system performance and user behavior.

58e4a395c50f90cdd391e6e9	Intensional polymorphism, the ability to dispatch to different routines based on types at run time, enables a variety of advanced implementation techniques for polymorphic languages, including tag-free garbage collection, unboxed function arguments, polymorphic marshalling, and flattened data structures. To date, languages that support intensional polymorphism have required a type-passing (as opposed to type-erasure) interpretation where types are constructed and passed to polymorphic functions at run time.
58e4a4d3c50f90cdd391e7cb	In this paper, we consider a proof checker for classical logic based on earlier work by Andreas Abel, Bor-Yuh Evan Chang, and Frank Pfenning on the Tutch proof checking system for intuitionistic propositional logic. A formal system for this classical logic proof checker is given and soundness and completeness theorems are proven. The work is motivated by the desire to extend the domain of the Tutch proof checking system to other logics and by the desire to create a pedagogic tool for students learning classical logic.

58e4a5f0c50f90cdd391e893	We present a judgemental formulation of natural deduction for classical logic, similar in spirit to Wadler's dual calculus, but founded on the logical judgements A true and A false; proof-by-contradiction, which puts these two judgements in opposition, lies at the heart of our system. We then show directly a normalization property for this system by a purely syntactic structural induction.

58e4a904c50f90cdd391eac0	A recent SIGACT News Logic column, guest-written by James Cheney DOI= 10.1145/1107523.1107537, discussed nominal logic [1], an approach to abstract syntax with binding structure. In addition to providing a worthy tutorial on nominal logic, that column leveled five criticisms at higher-order abstract syntax, an alternative approach for dealing with binding structure in abstract syntax. We argue below that three of those criticisms are factually inaccurate, and the other two are misguided.
5834868825ff05a97b016f10	We introduce EDM Vis, an information visualization software tool for exploring, navigating and understanding student data logs. EDM Vis loads student logs, entire classes, hundreds of students, at a time, and displays the student behavior of those students as they solved problems using a software tutor. The visualization uses a tree structure to provide an overview of class performance, and interface elements to allow easy navigation and exploration of student behavior.
5834868825ff05a97b016f15	We introduce a novel data structure, the Interaction Network, for representing interaction-data from open problem solving environment tutors. We show how using network community detecting techniques are used to identify subgoals in problems in a logic tutor. We then use those community structures to generate high level hints between subgoals. The preliminary results show that using network analysis techniques are promising for exploring and understanding user data from open problem solving environments.
5834868825ff05a97b016f18	We are developing games to increase student learning and attitudes in introductory CS courses. Wu's Castle is a game where students program changes in loops and arrays in an interactive, visual way. The game provides immediate feedback and helps students visualize code execution in a safe environment. We compared the game to a traditional programming assignment in an introductory CS course. In our study, half of the students were randomly selected to play the learning game first and half to write a program first.
5834868825ff05a97b016f5b	The question of the existence of large cycles in random graphs is one of the basic problems of the subject. The threshold for the existence of hamilton cycles has been established by Komlos and Szemerédi [11]. There are now several alternative proofs and generalisations of this result—see for example Bollobas [1], Bollobas and Frieze [2], Fenner and Frieze [5, 6], Frieze [7, 8] and Luczak [12].
5834868825ff05a97b016fdf	Storage systems represent a vital market that is growing faster than the personal computer market. No longer able to rely on the captive markets of single-vendor computing systems, the need to compete in the price-sensitive open market of personal computers has driven media areal growth rates from 25 percent per year to 60 percent per year. This increase in density growth rate has been accompanied by a 35-50 percent per year decrease in the cost per byte of storage. This trend is certainly not the last gasp of an obsolete technology.
5834868825ff05a97b017c30	Reviews the problems, solutions and open issues in global software development (GSD), in which the software development activities are distributed across multiple sites. First, we introduce the reasons why GSD is becoming more and more prevalent. Then we outline the issues created or amplified by GSD and illustrate various effects it has on a software project. Finally, we summarize the literature on existing approaches to reduce the negative effects of GSD and list key open research questions.
58c95027c50f90cdd385f9b5	We report the first experimental performance evaluation of a 75-μm-long plasmonic multimode interference switch that is hetero-integrated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, operating with 10-Gb/s data signals. The switch exhibits a 2.9-μs response time and 44.5% modulation depth, while the extinction ratio between the ports alters from 5.4 to-1.5 dB for 35-mW electrical (switching) power. Error-free performance was achieved.
5834868825ff05a97b016288	We present axioms and inference rules for reasoning about Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange protocols and use these rules to prove authentication and secrecy properties of two important protocol standards, the Diffie-Hellman variant of Kerberos, and IKEv2, the revised standard key management protocol for IPSEC. The new proof system is sound for an accepted semantics used in cryptographic studies. In the process of applying our system, we uncover a deficiency in Diffie-Hellman Kerberos that is easily repaired.
58c9514cc50f90cdd385fa66	We demonstrate an all-optical, self-synchronization scheme for optical packet switched network nodes. It provides both the packet clock signal and the packet beginning, marker pulse. The circuit uses two hybridly integrated MZI switches and has been evaluated with synchronous, asynchronous and variable length, data packets at 10 Gb/s. It is compact and requires relatively low energies to operate.
58c951c7c50f90cdd385fab0	The first system-level experimental results of hybrid Si-DLSPP structures incorporated into a SOI chip are reported. We demonstrate over 7nm Thermo-optical tuning of a Si-Plasmonic racetrack-resonator and verify error-free 10Gb/s transmission through 60um Si-Plasmonic waveguide.
58c9528ec50f90cdd385fb2b	We demonstrate an all-optical four-wavelength 3R burst mode regenerator, operating error-free with 10-Gb/s variable length data packets that exhibit 6-dB packet-to-packet power variation. The circuit was implemented using a sequence of three integrated quadruple semiconductor optical amplifier-based Mach-Zehnder interferomentric arrays.
58c952bac50f90cdd385fb44	We demonstrate a photonic routing system that resolves the contention between bursty optical packets. The circuit is realized exclusively with integrated photonic components through the interconnection of semiconductor optical amplifier Mach-Zehnder interferometers gate arrays and optical flip-flops. The system resolves the contention-without burst segmentation-in the wavelength domain with a low power penalty (< 1 dB).
5834868825ff05a97b016296	We present the design, implementation and evaluation of an algorithm that checks audit logs for compliance with privacy and security policies. The algorithm, which we name reduce, addresses two fundamental challenges in compliance checking that arise in practice. First, in order to be applicable to realistic policies, reduce operates on policies expressed in a first-order logic that allows restricted quantification over infinite domains. We build on ideas from logic programming to identify the restricted form of quantified formulas.
58c9539ac50f90cdd385fbd1	We present a new NRZ wavelength conversion scheme based on SOA-MZI.
58c9540dc50f90cdd385fc16	A method that utilizes permeation cells in conjunction with gas chromatography was developed to measure permeation of d-limonene vapour through packaging materials at very low gradient concentrations. The same method, when properly adjusted, can be used to determine the effect of temperature and relative humidity on permeation.
58c95462c50f90cdd385fc4b	We evaluate the cascadability performance of a new semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based nonreturn-to-zero wavelength converter in a loop experiment. We use the bidirectional data injection control scheme with an additional continuous-wave signal to optimize the gains and phases imparted by the SOAs. The scheme has been shown to be capable of eight cascaded, error-free wavelength conversions at 10 Gb/s.
58c95486c50f90cdd385fc60	Abstract—We present the first system-level demonstration of an active plasmonic device in 10 Gb/s data traffic conditions. An asymmetric silicon-plasmonic Mach-Zehnder Interferometer with dielectric-loaded plasmonic waveguides serving as the electrically controlled arms operates as thermo-optic ON/OFF gating element with 2.8 μs response time and 10.8 mW power consumption.
5834868825ff05a97b01629f	Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) is a logic for proving security properties of network protocols that use public and symmetric key cryptography. The logic is designed around a process calculus with actions for possible protocol steps including generating new random numbers, sending and receiving messages, and performing decryption and digital signature verification actions. The proof system consists of axioms about individual protocol actions and inference rules that yield assertions about protocols composed of multiple steps.
58c9560cc50f90cdd385fd4b	This paper describes recent research activities and results in the area of photonic switching carried out within the framework of the EU-funded e-Photon/ONe+ network of excellence, Virtual Department on Optical Switching. Technology aspects of photonics in switching and, in particular, recent advances in wavelength conversion, ring resonators, and packet switching and processing subsystems are presented as the building blocks for the implementation of a high-performance router for the next-generation Internet.
58e4aa90c50f90cdd391ebdc	We present a technique for higher-order representation of substructural logics such as linear or modal logic. We show that such logics can be encoded in the (ordinary) Logical Framework, without any linear or modal extensions. Using this encoding, metatheoretic proofs about such logics can easily be developed in the Twelf proof assistant.
58e4abc3c50f90cdd391ecb3	I present a type-theoretic encoding of objects that interprets method dispatch by self-application (ie, method functions are applied to the objects containing them) but still validates the expected subtyping relationships. The naive typing of self-application fails to validate the expected subtyping relationships because it is too permissive and allows application to similarly typed objects that are not self. This new encoding solves this problem by constraining methods to be applied only to self using existential and intersection types.
58e4abefc50f90cdd391ecd1	Providing type structure for extremely low-level programming languages, such as assembly language, yields a number of important benefits for compiler and systems projects, where reliability and security are crucial concerns. We discuss some of the issues involved in designing type systems for low-level languages, and identify some general principles that simplify constructing a proof of soundness.
58e4ace4c50f90cdd391ed7f	Foundational certified code systems seek to prove untrusted programs to be safe relative to safety policies given in terms of actual machine architectures, thereby improving the systems' flexibility and extensibility. Previous efforts have employed a structure wherein the proofs are expressed in the same logic used to express the safety policy. We propose an alternative structure wherein safety proofs are expressed in the Twelf metalogic, thereby eliminating from those proofs an extra layer of encoding needed in the previous accounts.
58e4ae43c50f90cdd391ee76	We present the design of a typed assembly language called TALT that supports heterogeneous tuples, disjoint sums, and a general account of addressing modes. TALT also implements the von Neumann model in which programs are stored in memory, and supports relative addressing. Type safety for execution and for garbage collection are shown by machine-checkable proofs. TALT is the first formalized typed assembly language to provide any of these features.
58e4aebbc50f90cdd391eecc	Intensional polymorphism, the ability to dispatch to different routines based on types at run time, enables a variety of advanced implementation techniques for polymorphic languages, including tag-free garbage collection, unboxed function arguments, polymorphic marshalling, and flattened data structures. To date, languages that support intensional polymorphism have required a type-passing (as opposed to type-erasure) interpretation where types are constructed and passed to polymorphic functions at run time.
58e503d7c50f90cdd3922824	Exercise 14 Assume that is a fixed constant. Use Bourgain's Theorem to show that there is a sharp threshold Òµ for satisfiability when the Ô-Model is used. Follow the idea of the proof for the chromatic number. Argue that if there is a coarse threshold then (i) containing some bounded uniquely satisfiable sub-formula makes a significant difference to the probability of unsatisfiability,(ii) transform this to constraints on a bounded set of variables,(iii) transform this to adding a bounded number of clauses.
58e559fec50f90cdd3926271	Natural graphite single crystals and polycrystals have been deformed at room temperature and optical and electron microscope studies of these have been coupled with x-ray investigations. The appearance and disappearance of x-ray diffraction peaks corresponding to the rhombohedral structure has been investigated. After plastic shearing the graphite crystals contain many tilt and twist boundaries and are profusely twinned. A mechanism is proposed for the production of the rhombohedral form.
58e55f05c50f90cdd39265e1	A detailed investigation has been made of twins in graphite crystals. The twins are regions misoriented from the crystal by a rotation of 20$^\\circ $48'about a direction in the basal plane. The twin boundaries are shown to be simple tilt boundaries of a particular angle. As well as twins, bend planes of varying angle are also observed in graphite crystals. The dislocation structure of the twin boundary is deduced and the effect of twins on the mechanical properties of graphite crystals is considered.
5834868825ff05a97b017cac	In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm for 3-0 scene analysis. This algorithm uses a segmentation of the surfaces to identified into geometrical primitives, the original data being obtained by a laser range finder. Moreover, the algorithm estimates precisel the location and orientation of an identified object of the scene. Results are presented on real objects.
5834868825ff05a97b017d10	Pervasive activity monitoring in a skilled-nursing facility helps capture a continuous audio and video record. The CareMedia project analyzes this video information by automatically tracking people, helping to efficiently label individuals, and characterizing selected activities and actions.
5834868825ff05a97b017d22	Video classification is the first step toward multimedia content understanding. When video is classified into conceptual categories, it is usually desirable to combine evidence from multiple modalities. However, combination strategies in previous studies were usually ad hoc. We investigate a meta-classification combination strategy using Support Vector Machine, and compare it with probability-based strategies. Text features from closed-captions and visual features from images are combined to classify broadcast news video.
58ca46f1c50f90cdd3869454	The present invention describes an improved beverage can end which utilizes less material and has an improved internal buckle strength based on the geometric configuration of the chuck wall, inner panel wall, central panel and reduced depth between the countersink and crown of a circular end wall.
58ca543cc50f90cdd3869d67	The term big data arose under the explosive increase of global data as a technology that is able to store and process big and varied volumes of data, providing both enterprises and science with deep insights over its clients/experiments. Cloud computing provides a reliable, fault-tolerant, available and scalable environment to harbour big data distributed management systems. Within the context of this paper we present an overview of both technologies and cases of success when integrating big data and cloud frameworks.
58cd2f75c50f90cdd3886c9a	Managed security service providers (MSSPs) must manage and monitor thousands of intrusion detection sensors. The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character...
58c95682c50f90cdd385fd92	Abstract—We demonstrate experimental evidence of the data capture and the low-energy thermo-optic tuning credentials of dielectric-loaded plasmonic structures integrated on a silicon chip. We show 7nm thermo-optical tuning of a plasmonic racetrack-resonator with less than 3.3 mW required electrical power and verify error-free 10Gb/s transmission through a 60μm long dielectric-loaded plasmonic waveguide.
5834868825ff05a97b0162aa	We introduce an electronic three-way lexicon, Tharwa, comprising Dialectal Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and English correspondents. The paper focuses on Egyptian Arabic as the first pilot dialect for the resource, with plans to expand to other dialects of Arabic in later phases of the project. We describe Tharwa's creation process and report on its current status. The lexical entries are augmented with various elements of linguistic information such as POS, gender, rationality, number, and root and pattern information.
5834868825ff05a97b0162b0	In this paper we present an analysis of revival actions in a third person shooter video game. We observe that players who revived their teammates played significantly more sessions. They appear also to be more skilled and successful in the game in terms of kills, wins, and deaths. We then discuss how to extend our analysis methodology to other types of social play as well as other games.
58c958d1c50f90cdd385fefd	While significant recent progress has been made in development of mobile robots for planetary suface exploration, there remain major challenges. These include increased autonomy of operation, traverse of challenging terrain, and fault-tolerance under long, unattended periods of use.
58c95921c50f90cdd385ff2d	We demonstrate an optical static random access memory cell that provides read and write functionality at 5 Gb/s. The circuit comprises a hybridly integrated semiconductor optical amplifier-Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SOA-MZI) flip-flop serving as the memory unit and two additional SOA-based cross-gain modulation switches for controlling access to the memory cell.
58c959d8c50f90cdd385ff97	• Radio drives concurrency requirements:• Want to communicate as quickly as possible to minimize wake time.(⇒ use min. pulse width)• Radio requires service for each bit.• OS must service radio every 50µs• If doing anything else, must context switch twice per 50µs (40,000 switches/s.)• At 4MHz, 100 cycle “budget” for switching overhead and work.
5834868825ff05a97b0162b9	We present an exploratory analysis of the effects of game world topologies on self-reported player experience in Computer Role Playing Games (CRPGs). We find that (a) players are more engaged in game worlds that better match their self-reported preferences; and (b) player preferences for game topology can be predicted based on their in-game behavior. We further describe how in-game behavioral features that correlate to preferences can be used to control procedural content generation algorithms.
5834868825ff05a97b0162d8	In this work, we develop algorithms for tracking time sequences of sparse spatial signals with slowly changing sparsity patterns, and other unknown states, from a sequence of nonlinear observations corrupted by (possibly) non-Gaussian noise. A key example of the above problem occurs in tracking moving objects across spatially varying illumination changes, where motion is the small dimensional state while the illumination image is the sparse spatial signal satisfying the slow-sparsity-pattern-change property.
58c98560c50f90cdd38618fc	This paper describes experimental results on using Winnow and Weighted-Majority based algorithms on a real-world calendar scheduling domain.

58e7697bc50f90cdd393de2e	By employing Kranoselskii's fixed point theorem, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of nonoscillatory solutions of the forced higher-order nonlinear neutral dynamic equation\\[[x (t)+ p (t) x (\\tau (t))]^{\\nabla^ m}+\\sum^{k} _ {i= 1} p_ {i}(t) f_ {i}(x (\\tau_ {i}(t)))= q (t)\\] on a time scale, where $ p_ {i}(t) $, $ f_ {i}(t) $ and $ q (t) $ may be oscillatory. Then we establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of nonoscillatory solutions to the equation $[x (t)+ p (t) x (\\tau (t))]^{\\nabla^ m}+ F (t, x (\\delta (t)))= q (t) $.
58e76a90c50f90cdd393deea	In this paper, we study a certain kind of impulsive reaction–diffusion equation models. With the methods of Lewis and Li (2012) and others, we provide an explicit formula for the spreading speed in terms of model parameters, and show that the spreading speed can be characterized as the slowest speed of a class of traveling wave solutions. Some applications are presented to show that our results essentially include and generalize some existing ones.
58e76c04c50f90cdd393dfea	In this paper, we establish the existence of nonoscillatory solutions to a class of higher-order nonlinear neutral dynamic equations on time scales by employing Kranoselskii's fixed point theorem. In addition, two examples are included to illustrate the significance of the results.
58e7a233c50f90cdd3940534	A new species of the genus Impatiens is described from Hubei province, China. Although it shares some features with I. dicentra, such as single-flowered peduncles and a filamentous bristle terminating the upper of the lateral united petals, it possesses distinct traits such as shorter plant height, rhombic to sub-rhombic leaves, lateral sepals entire, and lower sepals navicular without a spur. We believe that this is a new addition to the speciose Impatiens genus, and propose the name Impatiens shennongensis Q. Wang & HP Deng.
58f4e0bcc50f90cdd397ac0e	BACKGROUND: Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a nascent field within the realm of reconstructive surgery. When autologous tissue is neither available nor sufficient to reconstruct complex defects of the human form, CTA may provide an alternative. However, skin rejection in composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is the pace-limiting obstacle for wider adoption in clinical practice. This study aims to identify a computational model of cytokine network dynamics that mediate acute rejection within the skin following CTA.
58f63e5ec50f90cdd3983e01	In this work, we present a dynamic response spoken dialogue system (DRSDS). It is capable of understanding the verbal/nonverbal language of users and making instant, situation-aware response. Incorporating with two external systems, MultiSense and email summarization, we built an email reading agent on mobile device to show the functionality of DRSDS.
58f6d5c0c50f90cdd398778f	We present an application of Gaussian processes to the problem of discovering “damped Lyman-α systems”(DLAs), dense regions of hydrogen gas that are likely the birthplace of galaxies like the Milky Way. We apply this method to a large spectroscopic survey of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III).
58f71f97c50f90cdd39893fe	We present an efficient algorithm to actively select samples which accurately model a target function below a specified threshold. We describe several heuristics for choosing these samples, and show how these heuristics perform on synthetic and real target functions. We then show how these algorithms can be used to make a sophisticated statistical procedure for finding confidence regions two orders of magnitude more data efficient.
58f71fcfc50f90cdd3989417	OBJECTIVE We propose a new method for detecting patterns of disease cases that correspond to emerging outbreaks. Our Anomaly Pattern Detector (APD) first uses a “local anomaly detector” to identify individually anomalous records and then searches over subsets of the data to detect self-similar patterns of anomalies.

58f72239c50f90cdd3989517	Objective Disjunctive anomaly detection (DAD) algorithm [1] can efficiently search across multidimensional biosurveillance data to find multiple simultaneously occurring (in time) and overlapping (across different data dimensions) anomalous clusters. We introduce extensions of DAD to handle rich cluster interactions and diverse data distributions.
58f724fec50f90cdd3989638	We develop spectral learning algorithms for Hidden Markov Models that learn not only from time series, or dynamic data but also static data drawn independently from the HMM's stationary distribution. This is motivated by the fact that static, orderless snapshots are usually easier to obtain than time series in quite a few dynamic modeling tasks. Building on existing spectral learning algorithms, our methods solve convex optimization problems minimizing squared loss on the dynamic data plus a regularization term on the static data.
58c991e2c50f90cdd3862056	In this study, we are using a multi-party recording as a template for building a parametric speech synthesiser which is able to express different levels of attentiveness in backchannel tokens. This allowed us to investigate i) whether it is possible to express the same perceived level of attentiveness in synthesised than in natural backchannels; ii) whether it is possible to increase and decrease the perceived level of attentiveness of backchannels beyond the range observed in the original corpus.
5834868825ff05a97b0162f4	Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations outof-date.
5834868825ff05a97b0162fc	The ability to transfer knowledge gained in previous tasks into new contexts is one of the most important mechanisms of human learning. Despite this, adapting autonomous behavior to be reused in partially similar settings is still an open problem in current robotics research. In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic framework for learning transferable motion policies. Our goal is to solve a learning problem in a target domain by utilizing the training data in a different but related source domain.
58cfc40fc50f90cdd389c35a	Objective To summarize the species of organogels and their applications in drug delivery. Methods At least 53 representative papers recently published were consulted, analyzed and summarized. Results The molecular properties, structure types and formation mechanisms of different organogels were illustrated; their applications in transdermal, parenteral depot, oral and trans-mucosal formulations were reviewed. Conclusions The organogel systems have become widely known as a very attractive platform for drug delivery.
58cd67e6c50f90cdd3888925	ABSTRACT: Torsion of Gall bladder is extremely rare condition and poses diagnostic challenge. The incidence of this condition is uncommon in children. We report a case of torsion of Gall bladder in a child presenting as peritonitis which was only detected at laparotomy. The gallbladder was found to be twisted around its pedicle and to be gangrenous. Cholecystectomy was performed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course. We also reviewed 245 cases reported in the Japanese literature.
58ca5d37c50f90cdd386a386	Relating software architecture to implementation is essential for effective software development and evolution. However, significant gaps exit between abstract architecture models and the more concrete models supported by implementation tools, making it difficult to ensure that an architecture and implementation are consistent.
58ca5f0ec50f90cdd386a4b1	In an attempt to systematically address what factors affect organizational performance, we built a dynamic computational framework for examining organizational performance in which organizations are composed of intelligent adaptive agents. Using this framework the user can contrast organizations with different designs, existing in different task emvironments, and subject to different stresses. We demonstrate the value of this model by examining how training and stress affect organizational performance.
58ca5f33c50f90cdd386a4cc	Radar-Soar, an artificial organization composed of intelligent agents, is crafted out of multiple interconnected modules-one of each agent, one of the organizational design (structure plus process), and one of the task. Each agent is based on a sophisticated model of cognition, ie, Soar. Using Radar-Soar we demonstrate how insight into organizational (and so social) behavior can be gained using computational models that take a meso-approach to organizations.
58cada06c50f90cdd386f87b	This paper gives an account of some of the recent developments in statistical inference in which concepts and results from integral and differential geometry have been instrumental. A great many important contributions to the field of integral and differential geometry in statistics are not discussed or even referred to here, but a rather comprehensive overview of the field can be obtained from the material compiled in the present volume and from the survey paper by Barndorff-Nielsen, Cox and Reid (1986).

58cb6b8ec50f90cdd3875b14	Visual inspection is, by far, the most widely used method in aircraft surface inspection. We are currently developing a prototype remote visual inspection system, designed to facilitate testing the hypothesized feasibility and advantages of remote visual inspection of aircraft surfaces. In this paper, we describe several experiments with image understanding algorithms that were developed to aid remote visual inspection, in enhancing and recognizing surface cracks and corrosion from the live imagery of an aircraft surface.

58cc66b3c50f90cdd3880225	We describe a method that aligns polyphonic audio recordings of music to symbolic score information in standard MIDI files without the difficult process of polyphonic transcription. By using this method, we can search through the MIDI database to find the MIDI file corresponding to a polyphonic audio recording.
58f72607c50f90cdd39896a4	Virtually all methods of learning dynamic systems from data start from the same basic assumption: the learning algorithm will be given a sequence, or trajectory, of data generated from the dynamic system. We consider the case where the data is not sequenced. The training data points come from the system's operation but with no temporal ordering. The data are simply drawn as individual disconnected points. While making this assumption may seem absurd at first glance, many scientific modeling tasks have exactly this property.
58f78da6c50f90cdd398be39	Transfer learning algorithms are used when one has sufficient training data for one supervised learning task (the source/training domain) but only very limited training data for a second task (the target/test domain) that is similar but not identical to the first. Previous work on transfer learning has focused on relatively restricted settings, where specific parts of the model are considered to be carried over between tasks. Recent work on covariate shift focuses on matching the marginal distributions on observations $ X $ across domains.
58f78f35c50f90cdd398bede	An important task in exploring and analyzing real-world data sets is to detect unusual and interesting phenomena. In this paper, we study the group anomaly detection problem. Unlike traditional anomaly detection research that focuses on data points, our goal is to discover anomalous aggregated behaviors of groups of points. For this purpose, we propose the Flexible Genre Model (FGM). FGM is designed to characterize data groups at both the point level and the group level so as to detect various types of group anomalies.
58f78fd9c50f90cdd398bf20	We present an efficient algorithm to actively select queries for learning the boundaries separating a function domain into regions where the function is above and below a given threshold. We develop experiment selection methods based on entropy, misclassification rate, variance, and their combinations, and show how they perform on a number of data sets. We then show how these algorithms are used to determine simultaneously valid 1− α confidence intervals for seven cosmological parameters.
58f79278c50f90cdd398c034	This paper summarizes our work and our understanding on volumetric pathological neuroimage retrieval under the framework of classification-driven feature selection. The main effort concerns off-line image feature space reduction for improved image indexing feature discriminating power as well as reduced computational cost during on-line pathological neuroimage retrieval.
58f794d8c50f90cdd398c12b	The automatic construction of active appearance models (AAMs) is usually posed as finding the location of the base mesh vertices in the input training images. In this paper, we repose the problem as an energy-minimizing image coding problem and propose an efficient gradient-descent algorithm to solve it.
58f79524c50f90cdd398c14c	We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a finite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem.

We participated in the shared task Machine Translation of News and submitted translation systems for three different directions: English→ German, German→ English and English→ Romanian.
58ceea87c50f90cdd38952dd	Three-dimensional live cell imaging of the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) visualizes the subcellular distributions of signaling intermediates during T cell activation at thousands of resolved positions within a cell. These information-rich maps of local protein concentrations are a valuable resource in understanding T cell signaling. Here, we describe a protocol for the efficient acquisition of such imaging data and their computational processing to create four-dimensional maps of local concentrations.
58cf8150c50f90cdd389a0dd	Current publish/subscribe systems offer a range of expressive subscription languages for constraints. However, classical systems restrict the publish operation to be a single published object that contains only constants and no constraints. We introduce symmetric publish/subscribe, a novel generalization of publish/subscribe where both publications and subscriptions contain constraints in addition to constants. Published objects are matched to subscriptions by computing the intersection of their constraints.

We assume such a merge is intended to create a single dataset that unambiguously describes the information in the source datasets using the alignment. We also assume that the merged result should reflect the observations of the datasets as specifically as possible. Typically, there will be no...
58dfaddec50f90cdd38ec6e5	Network research relies on packet generators to assess performance and correctness of new ideas. Software-based generators in particular are widely used by academic researchers because of their flexibility, affordability, and open-source nature. The rise of new frameworks for fast IO on commodity hardware is making them even more attractive. Longstanding performance differences of software generation versus hardware in terms of throughput are no longer as big of a concern as they used to be few years ago.
58dfc0b6c50f90cdd38ed155	A sensing manipulator of an articulated arm is disclosed. The sensing manipulator includes a compliant section and a movement detection system provided along a first direction of the compliant section such that movement of the compliant section along both the first direction and at least one direction transverse to said first direction, are detectable by the movement detection system.
58cdfaf6c50f90cdd388d61d	Many modern signal and information processing tasks center around the discovery of (significant) interactions in a large, complex system from measurements made about it. This can be thought of as reconstructing a graph, that is, the discovery of the (significant) edges of an appropriate graph from data. In this dissertation, we devise provably robust and efficient algorithms for various graph reconstruction problems.
58ce48a5c50f90cdd388fed3	We present an algorithm which determines isomorphism of graphs in v O (g) steps where v is the number of vertices and g is the genus of the graphs. In [FMR 79] an algorithm was presented for embedding graph on surfaces of genus g in v O (g) steps. Here we show how to extend this algorithm to isomorphism testing for graphs of small genus. This result is noteworthy for at least two reasons. First, this extends the polynomial time isomorphism results for the plane [HT 72] and also the projective plane [L 80] to arbitrary surfaces.
58ce64dcc50f90cdd3890d78	Understanding knowledge representations in neural nets has been a difficult problem. Principal components analysis (PCA) of contributions (products of sending activations and connection weights) has yielded valuable insights into knowledge representations, but much of this work has focused on the correlation matrix of contributions. The present work shows that analyzing the variance-covariance matrix of contributions yields more valid insights by taking account of weights.
58cf5a68c50f90cdd3898cac	A rapid nozzle performance analysis methodology and project for two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzle have been developed. A one-dimensional isentropic flow model is employed to calculate the parameters of nozzle internal flow field. And the skin friction coefficient is used to correct the non-isentropic flow effect. Method of integral around the nozzle surface is used to compute the thrust. The divergence factor is applied to correct the nozzle thrust loss which because that the nozzle exit flow is radially divergent.
59074736c50f90cdd39a0b47	The stress intensity factor (SIF) for tubular specimens were calculated based on virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The effects of geomet rical factors (inner radius, wall thickness and relative crack length) and external loads on the SIF were analyzed, respectively, by use of the single-variable approach. Finally, an approximate formula for SIF of compact-tensile tubular specimens was obtained as all factors mentioned were considered, which was presented as a reference for the tubular engineering design.
5907e1a8c50f90cdd39a4f7b	MLtuner automatically tunes settings for training tunables—such as the learning rate, the mini-batch size, and the data staleness bound—that have a significant impact on large-scale machine learning (ML) performance. Traditionally, these tunables are set manually, which is unsurprisingly error prone and difficult to do without extensive domain knowledge. MLtuner uses efficient snapshotting and optimization-guided online trial-and-error to find good initial settings as well as to re-tune settings during execution.
59090396c50f90cdd39abfee	Natural vibration frequencies and modes of repetitive structures, including symmetric, periodic, linking structures, are considered in this work. By using the repetition of the identical parts, we reduce the eigenvalue problem of the structure to a set of eigenvalue problems of lower dimensions associated with the parts. Special forms and properties of the modes of natural vibrations are observed.
58e0d70ec50f90cdd38f6b81	Digital forensic investigators often need to extract data from a seized device that contains NAND flash memory. Many such devices are physically damaged, preventing investigators from using automated techniques to extract the data stored within the device. Instead, investigators turn to chip-off analysis, where they use a thermal-based procedure to physically remove the NAND flash memory chip from the device, and access the chip directly to extract the raw data stored on the chip.
58e1a5a0c50f90cdd38ff04a	Allergic airway diseases such as asthma and allergic rhinitis are increasing in prevalence worldwide. The theory of an altered Th1/Th2 balance in allergic diathesis has recently been termed a “procrustean paradigm” as it failed to explain many preclinical findings. Regulatory T cells (Treg) have now been shown to be critical in T-cell homeostasis and in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance to allergens. Allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been shown to induce regulatory T cells in allergic patients.
58e326adc50f90cdd390eb34	An algorithm is presented for computing the eigenvalues of smallest magnitude and their associated \neigenvectors of the quadratic lambda-matrix M lambda/sup 2/ + C lambda + K. M, C, and K are \nassumed to be symmetric matrices with K positive definite and M negative definite. The algorithm \nis based on a generalization of the Rayleigh quotient and the Lanczos method for computing \neigenpairs of standard symmetric eigenproblems. Monotone quadratic convergence to the smallest \npositive and negative eigenvalue is proved. Test examples are presented.
58e3b28bc50f90cdd39143e3	We present in this paper a shallow embedding of Linear Temporal Logic in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. Our axiomatization is based on a co-inductive representation of program executions. Temporal operators are implemented as co-inductive (respectively inductive) types when they are greatest (respectively least) fixpoints, and several generic lemmas are proved to allow elegant and efficient reasoning in practical cases. This work results in several reusable libraries in the Coq proof-assistant.

5834868825ff05a97b0166ba	Context is an important, yet poorly understood and poorly utilized source of information in interactive computing. It will be of particular importance in the new millennium as users move away from their desktops and into settings where their contexts are changing rapidly. Context is difficult to use because, unlike other forms of user input, there is no common, reusable way to handle it. As a result, context-aware applications have been built in an ad hoc manner, making it difficult to build new applications or evolve existing ones.
58ceb4aac50f90cdd389372c	In this position paper, we discuss our ongoing work on understanding the users' smartphone text entry behaviors and needs in cross-application tasks.

591eb97dc50f90cdd3a525e0	In the random deletion channel, each bit is deleted independently with probability $ p $. For the random deletion channel, the existence of codes of rate $(1-p)/9$, and thus bounded away from $0 $ for any $ p< 1$, has been known. We give an explicit construction with polynomial time encoding and deletion correction algorithms with rate $ c_0 (1-p) $ for an absolute constant $ c_0> 0$.
59203503c50f90cdd3a5f765	Recurrent neural network grammars (RNNG) are a recently proposed probabilistic generative modeling family for natural language. They show state-of-the-art language modeling and parsing performance. We investigate what information they learn, from a linguistic perspective, through various ablations to the model and the data, and by augmenting the model with an attention mechanism (GA-RNNG) to enable closer inspection. We find that explicit modeling of composition is crucial for achieving the best performance.
58e4a328c50f90cdd391e69b	I present a type-theoretic encoding of objects that interprets method dispatch by self-application (ie, method functions are applied to the objects containing them) but still validates the expected subtyping relationships. The naive typing of self-application fails to validate the expected subtyping relationships because it is too permissive and allows application to similarly typed objects that are not self. This new encoding solves this problem by constraining methods to be applied only to self using existential and intersection types.
58e4ad56c50f90cdd391edd1	Intensional polymorphism, the ability to dispatch to different routines based on types at run time, enables a variety of advanced implementation techniques for polymorphic languages, including tag-free garbage collection, unboxed function arguments, polymorphic marshalling and attened data structures. To date, languages that support intensional polymorphism have required a type-passing (as opposed to type-erasure) interpretation where types are constructed and passed to polymorphic functions at run time.

58e524bbc50f90cdd3923ea6	Several theories for the strength of fibre-reinforced composites are briefly reviewed. Experimentally, the strength of continuously reinforced composites is found, with slight modifications, to obey the law of mixtures. The strength of discontinuously reinforced composites is found to depend upon the stress concentrating effect of fibre ends upon neighbouring fibres.

58e7bd22c50f90cdd3941715	The modes of continuous bars, strings and Euler beams constrained only at their 2 ends have an important qualitative property called oscillation property. Appropriate discrete models of bars, strings and Euler beams are expected to reflect the oscillation property in a discrete form. With help of an algebraic approach involving tri-and penta-diagonal matrix, the discrete modes of bars, strings and beams obtained with finite difference method were proved to have the oscillation property invariably, regardless of grid and mass distribution.

59209e1fc50f90cdd3a62b7d	As we aim to control complex systems, use of a simulator in model-based reinforcement learning is becoming more common. However, it has been challenging to overcome the Reality Gap, which comes from nonlinear model bias and susceptibility to disturbance. To address these problems, we propose a novel algorithm that combines data-driven system identification approach (Gaussian Process) with a Differential-Dynamic-Programming-based robust optimal control method (Iterative Linear Quadratic Control).
5930190bc50f90cdd3a8ff2f	We propose a computational model for interpreting line drawings as threedimensional surfaces, based on constraints on local surface orientation along extremal and discontinuity boundaries. Specific techniques are described for two key processes: recovering the three-dimensional conformation of a space curve (eg, a surface boundary) from its two-dimensional projection in an image, and interpolating smooth surfaces from orientation constraints along extremal boundaries.

59333b15c50f90cdd3aac653	Lysosome‐mediated autophagy is essential for cellular survival and homeostasis upon nutrient deprivation, but is repressed after feeding. Despite the emerging importance of transcriptional regulation of autophagy by nutrient‐sensing factors, the role for epigenetic control is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) mediates postprandial epigenetic repression of hepatic autophagy by recruiting histone demethylase LSD1 in response to a late fed‐state hormone, FGF19 (hFGF19, mFGF15).

58e55eddc50f90cdd39265c3	Rough estimates are made of the stress necessary to force a dislocation through a Guinier-Preston zone in an aluminum alloy containing 2 at.% copper and in an aluminum alloy containing 13 at.% silver. The values found are significantly less than those calculated using a model for the strength of a precipitation hardened alloy proposed by Orowan. It is suggested that the process of shearing the zones determines the initial flow-stress in these age-hardening alloys.

58e765adc50f90cdd393db96	Ball-type automatic balancers have been applied successfully to suppress unbalance vibrations of a rotor. A traditional ball-type automatic balancer consists of several balls moving along a fixed circular orbit. A new type of balancer, the ball-rod-spring balancer, in which the ball may move in the radial direction as well as in circumferential direction, has been proposed. This study aims to compare the performance of the new type of balancer with the traditional ball-type auto-balancer.

Fastening machine screws is among the most difficult components of this challenge. To accomplish this task with sufficient robustness for industry, detecting and recovering from failure is essential. We have built a robotic screwdriving system to collect data on this process. Using it, we collected data on 1862 screwdriving runs, each consisting of force, torque, motor current and speed, and video.

58f4e10ac50f90cdd397ac2f	Background: Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a nascent field within the realm of reconstructive surgery. When autologous tissue is neither available nor sufficient to reconstruct complex defects of the human form, CTA may provide an alternative. However, skin rejection in composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is the pace-limiting obstacle for wider adoption in clinical practice. This study aims to identify a computational model of cytokine network dynamics that mediate acute rejection within the skin following CTA.
58f4e29fc50f90cdd397acd7	Background Trauma often cooccurs with cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic shock. Skin and muscle injuries often lead to significant inflammation in the affected tissue. The primary mechanism by which inflammation is initiated, sustained, and terminated is cytokine-mediated immune signaling, but this signaling can be altered by cardiac arrest. The complexity and context sensitivity of immune signaling in general has stymied a clear understanding of these signaling dynamics.
58f4e305c50f90cdd397ad01	Acute skin rejection in vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is the major obstacle for wider adoption in clinical practice. This study utilized computational modeling to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for treatment of skin rejection. Protein levels of 14 inflammatory mediators in skin and muscle biopsies from syngeneic grafts [n= 10], allogeneic transplants without immunosuppression [n= 10] and allografts treated with tacrolimus [n= 10] were assessed by multiplexed analysis technology.
59354d39c50f90cdd3aba751	Conclusions A stretchable, soft optical sensor has been designed, tested, and fabricated. The signals for pressure, curvature, and stretch are linear and manufacturing methods are cheaper than traditional liquid metal sensors. With continued optimization, this soft optical sensor has the potential to replace current microfluidic sensors in many applications.

Plugin in those values forˆVmin andˆVmax, and the fact that||·|| 1 is convex with Jensen's inequality, proves the second result. The proof also applies in the continuous case by replacing the sum over s by an integral over the state space in the first and second equality.

58f430e6c50f90cdd39768e4	Verifying the correctness of finite-state concurrent programs has been an important problem for a long time. However, lack of any formal and efficient method of verification has prevented the creation of practical design aids for this purpose. Since all known techniques of simulation and prototype testing are time-consuming and not very reliable, there is an acute need for such tools. We describe an automatic verification system for such systems in which specifications are expressed in a propositional temporal logic.

58f6d70dc50f90cdd3987817	Early, reliable detection of outbreaks of disease, whether natural (eg, West Nile virus) or bioterrorist-induced (eg, anthrax and smallpox), is a critical problem today. It is important to detect outbreaks early in order to provide the best possible medical response and treatment, as well as to improve the chances of identifying the source. A primary goal of this project is to develop new Bayesian models and inference algorithms that then are applied to monitor electronically available healthcare data to achieve early, reliable detection of outbreaks.
58f6d774c50f90cdd3987841	Occupational health surveillance is a well accepted means of risk assessment. Tried and tested practices, procedures and processes have been developed, and guidelines for health surveillance using standard medical principals are available. Fatigue, sleep deprivation, illness, and drug and other substance use in the workplace is perceived to pose a significant threat to safety in the workplace. Employers attempting to discharge their duty of care are faced with implementing identification and control measures to counteract these problems.
58f70a8dc50f90cdd3988bc9	Modeling instance-level context and object-object relationships is extremely challenging. It requires reasoning about bounding boxes of different classes, locations\\etc. Above all, instance-level spatial reasoning inherently requires modeling conditional distributions on previous detections. Unfortunately, our current object detection systems do not have any {\\bf memory} to remember what to condition on! The state-of-the-art object detectors still detect all object in parallel followed by non-maximal suppression (NMS).
58f72149c50f90cdd39894b5	A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.

58f72404c50f90cdd39895d0	Learning dynamic models from observed data has been a central issue in many scientific studies or engineering tasks. The usual setting is that data are collected sequentially from trajectories of some dynamical system operation. In quite a few modern scientific modeling tasks, however, it turns out that reliable sequential data are rather difficult to gather, whereas out-of-order snapshots are much easier to obtain. Examples include the modeling of galaxies, chronic diseases such Alzheimer's, or certain biological processes.
58f78919c50f90cdd398bc5d	We discuss non-parametric density estimation and regression for astrophysics problems. In particular, we show how to compute non-parametric confidence intervals for the location and size of peaks of a function. We illustrate these ideas with recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also briefly discuss non-parametric Bayesian inference.
58f789d0c50f90cdd398bca7	This paper studies active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes.
58f78d30c50f90cdd398be09	In this paper we propose new nonparametric estimators for a family of conditional mutual information and divergences. Our estimators are easy to compute; they only use simple k nearest neighbor based statistics. We prove that the proposed conditional information and divergence estimators are consistent under certain conditions, and demonstrate their consistency and applicability by numerical experiments on simulated and on real data as well.

5935e1bcc50f90cdd3ac0bda	When training deep networks and other complex networks of predictors, the risk of overfitting is typically of large concern. We examine the use of stacking, a method for training multiple simultaneous predictors in order to simulate the overfitting in early layers of a network, and show how to utilize this approach for both forward training and backpropagation learning in deep networks. We then compare this approach to overfitting avoidance with the dropout method for a number of common tasks.
58f724b9c50f90cdd398961d	OBJECTIVE This paper shows how T-Cubes, a data structure that makes tracking millions of disease models simultaneously feasible, can be used to perform multivariate time series analysis using primitive univariate algorithms. Hence, the use of T-Cube in brute-force search helps identify stronger disease outbreak signals currently missed by the surveillance systems.

58f9db8fc50f90cdd3999f50	While deep feature learning has revolutionized techniques for static-image understanding, the same does not quite hold for video processing. Architectures and optimization techniques used for video are largely based off those for static images, potentially underutilizing rich video information. In this work, we rethink both the underlying network architecture and the stochastic learning paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series.

58fa2bf2c50f90cdd399bbe9	Online visitors often do not find the content they were expecting on specific pages of a large enterprise website, and subsequently search for it in site's search box. In this paper, we propose methods to leverage website search logs to identify missing or expected content on webpages on the enterprise website, while showing how several scenarios make this a non-trivial problem. We further discuss how our methods can be easily extended to address concerns arising from the identified missing content.
590994a1c50f90cdd39af566	We study the problem of interactive learning of a classifier from\\emph {noisy} labeling and pairwise comparison oracles with near-optimal label complexity. The comparison oracle answers which instance in the given two instances is more likely to be positive, and learning from both oracles has multiple applications ranging from the handwriting recognition to the recommendation system. However, much remains unknown concerning to what extent the comparison oracle helps to improve the label complexity.

5907ad9bc50f90cdd39a3838	To study the effect of strain rate on mechanical properties of polysulfone, tensile tests at different strain rates were performed, and the shape changes of samples during testing were recorded by camera also. The results show that the mechanical properties of the polysulfone were obviously ratedependent. Cracks induced by bubbles impurityies and other crack initiations propagated to form coin cracks along respective surfaces and resulted in tensile failure (single crack initiation) or tensile-shear failure (splitlevel multi-crack initiations).
5908b3c0c50f90cdd39aa1c3	An approach employing displacement–stress dual criteria for static shape control is presented. This approach is based on normal displacement control, and stress modification is considered in the whole optimization process to control high stress in the local domain. Analysis results show that not only is the stress reduced but also that the controlled surface becomes smoother than before.

590c0e0fc50f90cdd39c180a	We present a study of human tutorial dialogues in a core Computer Science domain that: focuses on individual tutoring sessions, rather than on contrasting different types of tutors; uses multiple regression analysis to correlate features of those sessions with learning outcomes; and highlights the effects of two types of tutor moves that have not been studied in depth so far, direct instruction and positive feedback.
5935e415c50f90cdd3ac0d23	The ability to transfer knowledge gained in previous tasks into new contexts is one of the most important mechanisms of human learning. Despite this, adapting autonomous behavior to be reused in partially similar settings is still an open problem in current robotics research. In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic framework for learning transferable motion policies. Our goal is to solve a learning problem in a target domain by utilizing the training data in a different but related source domain.

593316c4c50f90cdd3aab875	Fifty six million, six hundred eighty seven thousand, and forty. A big number, to be sure. This is the number of possible semantic analyses for an average sized sentence in the Mikrokosmos Machine Translation project. Complex sentences have gone past the trillions. If every combination could be accurately judged in one thousandth of a second, it would still take almost a day to analyze the average sentence. And you can forget about the hard ones. And yet, understanding natural language sentences is intuitively not an exponential a air.

5935fe21c50f90cdd3ac7c4a	We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a finite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem.

A two-disk motion planning strategy is proposed to navigate the object within the free space between the obstacles from an initial location to a final location. This method makes use of the medial axis transform of the free space. Two minimal overlapping disks are determined that fully enclose the moving object, and then the centers of the two disks are constrained to move continuously along a path on the medial axis.
5936747cc50f90cdd3acc500	This paper introduces a sensor based coverage algorithm and an overview of a mobile robot system for demining. The algorithm is formulated in terms of critical points which are the points where the topology of an environment changes. We developed a provably complete coverage algorithm which makes a robot pass over all possible points of an unknown environment.

The actuator includes: a first plate, a second plate, and an elastic element disposed between the first plate and the second plate and including a center portion and an edge portion, the center portion corresponding to a first thickness and the edge portion corresponding to a second thickness larger than the first thickness, a first shear stress associated with the center portion being approximately equal to a second shear stress associated with the edge portion.
59367c4fc50f90cdd3acca1f	Surgical Robotics was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 21–25 July 2014. The school was held at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University and at Allegheny General Hospital (part of Allegheny Health Network) and drew 62 trainees from six countries. Figure 1 shows the trainees, which included engineering graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, and other early-stage researchers. An international group of leading engineering and surgical faculty members was recruited to serve as instructors.
59367cfec50f90cdd3acca90	Biologically inspired robots perform many interesting and useful behaviors, but to effectively emulate their biological counterparts, robots often need to possess many degrees of freedom, complicating their mechanical design and making it difficult to apply standard control and motion planning strategies. To address this complexity, the robotics community has derived low-dimensional parameter-based controllers that naturally coordinate many degrees of freedom such as the serpenoid curves used to control snake robots.
59367d9ac50f90cdd3accaf4	Droplets on vertically vibrated fluid surfaces can walk and diffract through a single slit by a pilot wave hydrodynamic interaction [Couder, 2006; Bush, 2015]. Inspired by the correspondence between emergent macroscale dynamics and phenomena in quantum systems, we tested if robotic snakes, which resemble wave packets, behave emergently like particles or waves when interacting with an obstacle. In lab experiments and numerical simulations we measured how a multi-module snake-like robot swam through a single slit.

593681bfc50f90cdd3accdae	WE WOULD like to invite original papers on all aspects of electronic commerce, electronic government and related issues. The conference is meant to address the academic community as well as representatives of business, industry, government, NGOs and information technology sector. Thus-apart from research papers-practical presentations of existing solutions are very welcome, too. This year we specifically added the EGOV component as we would like to explore the e-government research and applications.
593690b7c50f90cdd3acd8b8	There is a need for instrument motion sensing with sufficient accuracy for microsurgery. An instrument featuring six-degree-of-freedom (6-dof) inertial sensing of intraoperative motion has been developed. With rms noise of 7.8 mm/s/sup 2/and 1.1 mdeg/s and bandwidth over 20 Hz, it is capable of capturing both gross motion and microscopic movements, eg, hand tremor. Preliminary results are presented.
593690e1c50f90cdd3acd8d6	We present a simple architecture capable of use in a wide variety of applications by focusing on basic principles of efficient decentralized operation. The resulting robust architecture is called dynamic task selection. We present an experiment that shows the ability of the system to work properly when some robots fail. It also shows the ability to add new robots dynamically while other robots are already performing a mission.
5936928cc50f90cdd3acd9f4	In this paper we summarize recent research results from a new technique of sensor calibration called shape-from-motion calibration. We first present the basic technique, which is an eigenspace analysis, and show that it includes the rigor of least squares without the full burden of measuring all the applied inputs. Next we present new research that removes another constraint of the calibration technique and extends the robustness to cover systems with slight nonlinearities.
5936940ac50f90cdd3acdaef	The objective of the CyberScout project is to develop an autonomous surveillance and reconnaissance system. In this paper, we focus on advances in vision-based surveillance agents for detection, scene mosaicing, classification and correspondence. An agent-based software framework is used to promote synergy between the various surveillance algorithms and provide a distributed computing infrastructure for the system.
59365baec50f90cdd3acb4b1	In this paper, we discuss in detail the motivation behind the creation of the Onika Iconic Programming Language and Human-Machine Interface, developed at Carnegie Mellon University and used to program and control various robotic systems in both automous and teleoperative modes. Additionally, we discuss the syntax and grammar of the iconic languages presented therein, and show how they can be used to create complete applications to be executed on any manipulator.
59365f77c50f90cdd3acb731	Design and analysis of real-time systems is heavily based on knowing worst-case execution times (WCET) of periodic threads and aperiodic servers. Accurately measuring WCET, however, is often difficult and sometimes impossible, for several reasons:• Interrupts in the system, which either execute longer than expected or occur more frequently than anticipated may steal critical execution time from the highest priority threads.
59366131c50f90cdd3acb850	Much attention has been paid to the question of how Bayesian integration of information could be implemented by a simple neural mechanism. We show that population vectors based on point-process inputs combine evidence in a form that closely resembles Bayesian inference, with each input spike carrying information about the tuning of the input neuron. We also show that population vectors can combine information relatively accurately in the presence of noisy synaptic encoding of tuning curves.

59369967c50f90cdd3acde76	A fast and robust algorithm for extracting line segments from an image through use of the Hough Transform is presented. The framework for our algorithm comes from the work of Illingworth and Kittler. We have extended their Adaptive Hough Transform algorithm to handle lines of arbitrary slope, multiple lines, and lines in very low signal to noise environments. We present our Modified Adaptive Hough Transform along with experimental results obtained with data from a tactile sensor.
593699a2c50f90cdd3acde9d	This paper reveals the essential equivalence of second order impedance control and proportional gain explicit force control with feedforward. This is first done analytically by reviewing each control method and showing how they mathematically correspond. For stiff environments the correspondence is exact. However, even for softer environments similar response of the system is indicated. Next, the results of an implementation of these control schemes on the CMU DD Arm II are presented, confirming the predictions of the analysis.
59369a5bc50f90cdd3acdf14	An instrument for intraoperative sensing of surgeons' hand tremor during vitreoretinal microsurgery has been developed. The instrument uses inertial sensing to detect tremor in six degrees of freedom. Instrument tip velocity is computed using the sensor data. The displacement amplitude of the tremor is then approximated analytically by modeling the velocity as sinusoidal. The instrument presently estimates oscillations at physiological tremor frequencies with error of less than 7%.
59369b2bc50f90cdd3acdf99	We present a software environment for composable simulation of mechatronic systems. By composable simulation we mean the ability to automatically generate simulations from individual component models through manipulation of the corresponding physical components in a CAD system. This form of virtual prototyping will reduce the design cycle significantly by providing immediate feedback to the designer with minimal intervention of simulation and modeling specialists.
5936a85fc50f90cdd3ace83c	Modern frameworks are required to be extendable as well as secure. However, these two qualities are often at odds.

593671ffc50f90cdd3acc363	The fundamental premise behind Moving Target Defense (MTD) is to create a dynamic and shifting system that is more difficult to attack than a static system because a constantly changing attack surface at least reduces the chance of an attacker finding and exploiting the weakness. However, MTD approaches are typically chosen without regard to other qualities of the system, such as performance or cost. This report explores the use of self-adaptive systems, in particular those based on the architecture of the running system.
59367452c50f90cdd3acc4e5	This paper describes the procedures that are required to implement, on a conventional mobile robot, a sensor based motion planning algorithm, based on the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG). The GVG is a roadmap of a static environment, and we describe how to incrementally construct this roadmap using only range information in an unknown environment. The GVG may then be used to guide future excursions into the explored environment. Experimental results validate the utility of this work.

5936cf02c50f90cdd3ad0415	The paper analyzes students' experience within a large scale e-learning course in a higher education setting. During the course students worked on successive assignments individually or in groups of three students in an alternating fashion. Captured data include students' platform behavior (login, resource accesses, eg, literature access, video access, active days, completed quizzes, resource coverage), students' final course grade as well as learning preferences, intrinsic motivation and satisfaction assessed via questionnaire.
5936cf7ac50f90cdd3ad046f	Adding student collaboration to an intelligent tutoring system could leverage the benefits of both approaches. We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.

Yet studies show that this assumption does not always hold true: some types of feedback do not benefit learners. This symposium brings together researchers investigating how feedback can be optimized to maximize potential benefits. The four papers include studies investigating the effectiveness of feedback from various sources including expert, peer and automatically generated feedback in the domains of writing and math.

In addition, it covers key concepts of a software architecture course, steps to pursue an architectural thinking, the elements of organizational architecture maturity and emerging trends and issues such as: Architecture evolution, Architecture conformance, Frameworks, platforms, and ecologies, and Self-Adaptive Systems.
5936a018c50f90cdd3ace2d0	The Dagstuhl Artifacts Series (DARTS) publishes evaluated research data and artifacts in all areas of computer science. An artifact can be any kind of content related to computer science research, eg, experimental data, source code, virtual machines containing a complete setup, test suites, or tools.
5936a183c50f90cdd3ace3c3	We began by considering the broad vision for analysis and evaluation of architectures: to provide an engineering discipline that allows architects to make principled architectural decisions, evaluate the impact of those decisions, determine the conformance between architectures and other artifacts (code, requirements, etc.), and extract architectural representations from implementations.

Design Fragments allow framework interactions to be explicitly defined, describing known-good uses of the framework. We demonstrate a tool that provides continual feedback on framework conformance as a program evolves.

His earlier work was oriented more towards operating systems and programming language research. We take this opportunity to look back at his research, putting it in a larger perspective, identifying some general themes that characterize his contributions to software engineering in particular, and to computer science in general.
5936a4c3c50f90cdd3ace5dc	Technological trends are leading to a world in which computing is all around us–in our cars, our kitchens, our offices, our phones, and even our clothes. In this world we can expect to see an explosion of computational devices, services, and information at our disposal. While this is an undeniable opportunity, currently we are ill-prepared to deal with its implications.
5936a4eec50f90cdd3ace5f8	Relating software architecture to implementation is essential for effective software development and evolution.

We present results from a needs assessment we conducted to understand the health information access practices and needs of various types of health workers in Pakistan.

5936e998c50f90cdd3ad16b6	Light field cameras have many advantages over traditional cameras, as they allow the user to change various camera settings after capture. However, capturing light fields requires a huge bandwidth to record the data: a modern light field camera can only take three images per second. This prevents current consumer light field cameras from capturing light field videos. Temporal interpolation at such extreme scale (10x, from 3 fps to 30 fps) is infeasible as too much information will be entirely missing between adjacent frames.
5936ec65c50f90cdd3ad1877	Light-field cameras have recently emerged as a powerful tool for one-shot passive 3D shape capture. However, obtaining the shape of glossy objects like metals, plastics or ceramics remains challenging, since standard Lambertian cues like photo-consistency cannot be easily applied. In this paper, we derive a spatially-varying (SV) BRDF-invariant theory for recovering 3D shape and reflectance from light-field cameras. Our key theoretical insight is a novel analysis of diffuse plus single-lobe SVBRDFs under a light-field setup.
5936edbcc50f90cdd3ad1955	Soft shadows, depth of field, and diffuse global illumination are common distribution effects, usually rendered by Monte Carlo ray tracing. Physically correct, noise-free images can require hundreds or thousands of ray samples per pixel, and take a long time to compute. Recent approaches have exploited sparse sampling and filtering; the filtering is either fast (axis-aligned), but requires more input samples, or needs fewer input samples but is very slow (sheared). We present a new approach for fast sheared filtering on the GPU.
5936f975c50f90cdd3ad1edf	In this paper, we summarize a new approach for the dissemination of robotics technologies. In a manner analogous to the personal computer movement of the early 1980's, we propose that a productive niche for robotic technologies is as a creative outlet for human expression and discovery. This paper describes our ongoing efforts to design, prototype and test a low-cost, highly competent personal rover for the domestic environment.

59370c9ec50f90cdd3ad276e	The increasing popularity and ubiquity of various large graph datasets has caused renewed interest for graph partitioning. Existing graph partitioners either scale poorly against large graphs or disregard the impact of the underlying hardware topology. A few solutions have shown that the nonuniform network communication costs may affect the performance greatly. However, none of them considers the impact of resource contention on the memory subsystems (eg, LLC and Memory Controller) of modern multicore clusters.
593712cdc50f90cdd3ad2abf	This paper presents the experimental results of the real-time performance of model-based control algorithms. We compare the computed-torque control scheme with the feedforward dynamics compensation scheme. The feedforward scheme compensates for the manipulator dynamics in the feedforward path while the computed-torque scheme uses the dynamics in the feedback loop for linearization and decoupling. The manipulator control schemes have been implemented on the CMU DD Arm II with a sampling period of 2 ms.

5937251ec50f90cdd3ad3408	Adaptation of software components is an important issue in Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE). Building a system from reusable or Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components introduces a set of problems, mainly related to compatibility and communication aspects. On one hand, components may have incompatible interaction behavior. This might require to restrict the system's behavior to a subset of safe behaviors. On the other hand, it might be necessary to enhance the current communication protocol.
5937277ec50f90cdd3ad34fc	MELD combines concepts from data flow and object-oriented programming languages in a unique approach to tool reusability. MELD provides three units of abstraction—equations, classes and features—that together allow sufficient options for granularity and encapsulation to support the implementation of reusable tools and the composition of existing tools in parallel (ie, interleaved) as well as in series.
5936ac0cc50f90cdd3aceaa8	Architectural analysis is key to producing high quality architectures. In this demonstration we present two extensions to AcmeStudio, and domain-neutral Architecture Development Environment, to add Performance and Security Simulation. Using AcmeStudio as the integration platform for these analyses allows comparisons and trade-offs between these different quality attributes.
5936b011c50f90cdd3aced51	A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made limp and the process repeats.
5936b394c50f90cdd3acef9f	The snakeboard is a well-studied example for mechanical systems analysis, largely because of its simultaneous richness in behavior and simplicity in design. However, few snakeboard models incorporate dissipative friction in the traveling direction and skidding as a violation of the rigid nonholonomic constraints. In this paper we investigate these effects on trajectory planning by evaluating a previously proposed friction model as well as a novel skidding model based on the addition of Rayleigh dissipation functions.
5936b3c0c50f90cdd3acefb7	Abstract—Having many degrees of freedom is both a blessing and a curse. A mechanism with a large number of degrees of freedom can better comply to and therefore better move in complex environments. Yet, possessing many degrees of freedom is only an advantage if the system is capable of coordinating them to achieve desired goals in realtime. This work supports the belief that a middle layer of abstraction between conventional planning and control is needed to enable robust locomotion of articulated systems in complex terrains.
5936b5a5c50f90cdd3acf0fa	Multirobot path planning and task assignment are traditionally treated separately, however task assignment can greatly impact the difficulty of the path planning problem, and the ultimate quality of solution is dependent upon both. We introduce task reassignment, an approach to optimally solving the coupled task assignment and path planning problems. We show that task reassignment improves solution quality, and reduces planning time in some situations.

The first mechanism defines a first plurality of grooves. The second mechanism defines a second plurality of grooves. The first and second pluralities of grooves cooperate to define at least two working ports along a length of the device. At least one of the first and second mechanisms are steerable.
5936b63bc50f90cdd3acf15a	We present a novel mechanical system, the “landfish,” which takes advantage of a combination of articulation and a nonholonomic constraint to exhibit fishlike locomotion. We apply geometric mechanics techniques to establish the equations of motion in terms of the system's nonholonomic momentum and analyze the system's equilibrium properties. Finally, we demonstrate its locomotion capabilities under several controllers, including heading and joint velocity control.
5936b653c50f90cdd3acf16a	A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made limp and the process repeats.

59372b4ac50f90cdd3ad3688	A robot can explore an unknown environment by incrementally constructing a roadmap of that environment using line of sight sensor information. Recall that a roadmap is a one-dimensional representation of a robot's environment. This paper addresses one problem that occurs while generating a roadmap: what happens when sonar sensors cannot detect sharp objects because of the specularities? To do this, a new sensor model is combined with an already existing incremental construction procedure for a roadmap.

59373fdac50f90cdd3ad3ee8	Information retrieval in a foreign language requires modification to text and user interfaces. Stemming, word boundary identification, punctuation and stopword identificdation must all be modified; appropriate input and presentation methods must be provided. But once these interface issues are resolved the retrieval model and enhancement techniques operate equally effectively in all the languages we have worked with.
5936b8dbc50f90cdd3acf355	This paper considers some implementation issues in a path planner for achieving uniform coverage of a non-Euclidean bony surface embedded in R3 space. The target application for this planner is bone removal in orthopaedic surgery, but the technique can also be applied to other general surface-coverage problems. Specifically, we use cellular decomposition and sweep lines to generate a set of meaningful way-points for the bone-burring robot to visit, then navigate between these way-points using potential functions.

5936dc73c50f90cdd3ad0e46	As speech technology continues to advance, the languages for which they are studied, and for which they have been developed also expands to cover more and more of those used by the first world countries. It is not until the recent years have efforts been made to apply our growing knowledge to languages of the developing world. However, building speech technologies for these languages has revealed new challenges such as the limited economic, human and speech resources, as well as the low-literacy of target population.
5936e1ecc50f90cdd3ad11ca	We propose several multiscaleiwavelet approaches that can be used to process and analyze DT-MRI data. These are schemes for:(1) wavelet shrinkageidenoising of diffusion weighted images,(2) wavelet denoising of diffusion tensor component images (having non-homogeneous noise properties), which can be used for approximate representation of the diffusion tensor field, and (3) multiscale estimates of differential geometric features (curvature, torsion, etc.).

5936e487c50f90cdd3ad137a	A method performed by one or more processors includes retrieving a set of images; selecting, based on the images retrieved, a reference template; calculating optimal transportation plans between the reference template and each of the images in the set; and calculating, using the optimal transportation plans, a linear optimal transportation metric between at least two images in the set.
5936e4a8c50f90cdd3ad138f	A fundamental difficulty facing those who wish to extract quantitative information from biomedical images is finding a manner with which to compare two morphological examplars (eg cells or sub cellular structures). We present a new approach for finding a linear embedding for a set of images that is isometric to a transportation-based metric. The approach is capable of quantifying both shapes as well as textures, is generative, and facilitates the use of geometric data processing techniques such as LDA and PCA.
59377c53c50f90cdd3ad577c	Measuring the similarity between different images is essential for performing registration (alignment) and many related tasks. We show that popular image similarity measures such as the sum of squared differences (SSD), cross correlation (CC), and mutual information (MI), particularly in the presence of noise, may present local optima at half pixel translation intervals when low order interpolators are used to model the discrete images. Several strategies for reducing local optima artifacts during registration are discussed.

Finally, we combine the results from Section 2.2 to obtain the DE (Section 2.3).
5936f45ec50f90cdd3ad1cc8	LiveObjects approaches expressive object design from the lens of art theory utilizing theatricality, or the perception of an object having presence, to create a series of IoT data objects. This approach actuates materials and everyday objects to express social data and provokes new interactions between objects, viewers, and space. We showcase how such objects can form unique expressive personalities, expose relational data, and perturb environments to form information spaces.
5936f69fc50f90cdd3ad1db2	Such kind of robots are inspired by the creatures which make individual societies eg, human beings, birds etc. They make relationships with other individuals and keep the social norms and values under consideration.

59370d9ac50f90cdd3ad27ef	All use subject to http://about. jstor. org/terms and to make decisions collectively. This type of research takes its cue from the work of famous robot scientist Rodney A. Brooks. In the behavior-based control algorithms that he pioneered, each robot reacts to local stimuli. There is no central plan, no colonel commanding the troops. Instead the team's action emerges as a consequence of the combination of individuals interacting with one another. As innovative as this approach is, many problems remain before it can bear fruit.
59370e4ac50f90cdd3ad284b	Whether a task can be completed after a failure of one of the degrees-of-freedom of a redundant manipulator depends on the joint angle at which the failure takes place. It is possible to achieve fault tolerance by globally planning a trajectory that avoids unfavorable joint positions before a failure occurs. In this paper we present a trajectory planning algorithm that guarantees fault tolerance while simultaneously satisfying joint limit and obstacle avoidance requirements.

5936f5bbc50f90cdd3ad1d56	Probing is a common operation employed to reduce the position uncertainty of objects. This paper demonstrates a technique for constructing provably near-optimal probing strategies for precisely localizing polygonal parts. This problem is shown to be dual to the well-studied grasping problem of computing optimal finger placements as defined by B. Mishra and others. A useful quality metric of any given probing strategy can easily be computed from simple geometric constructions in the displacement space of the polygon.

593713a8c50f90cdd3ad2b4b	An overview is presented to research on the analysis, synthesis, real-time implementation and performance evaluation of model-based manipulator control schemes. The schemes synthesize strategies that include a dynamical model of the manipulator in the feedback loop. Depending on the way that the dynamical model is incorporated, it is possible to create different types of control laws. For example, the computed-torque method utilizes the model is the feedback loop in order to both decouple and linearize the system.
59371bc2c50f90cdd3ad302d	A critical level of abstraction in the modeling of a large, complex system is its architecture. At an architectural level one models the principal system elements and their interaction. Architectural models are typically used to provide an intellectually tractable, birds-eye view of a system and to permit design-time reasoning about system-level concerns such as performance, reliability, portability, and conformance to external standards and architectural styles. In practice most architectural descriptions are informal documents.

59370cc3c50f90cdd3ad2782	The frustration of broken links from the early Web has been replaced today by the frustration of web servers stalling or crashing under the heavy load of dynamically generated content. Even seemingly static web pages are usually generated dynamically in order to include personalization and advertising features. Such dynamic content has high resource demands and poses a scalability problem for both web and database servers.
593713ecc50f90cdd3ad2cb4	A framework called task based design (TBD) to design an optimal robot manipulator for a given task is proposed. Only kinematic parameters are considered. An optimal manipulator is designed. It performs a given task best by using a framework called progressive design that decomposes the complexity of the task into three steps: kinematic design, planning, and kinematic control. As an example problem of TBD, a manipulator for a space shuttle tile servicing task is designed.
5937158dc50f90cdd3ad2d9f	Visual feedback has traditionally been used in the assembly process to a very limited extent.

59371a1cc50f90cdd3ad2f7f	This paper presents the first prototype of an active hand-held instrument to sense and compensate physiological tremor and other unwanted movement during vitreoretinal microsurgery. The instrument incorporates six inertial sensors (three accelerometers and three rate gyros) to detect motion of the handle. The movement of the instrument tip in three dimensions is then obtained using appropriate kinematic calculations. The motion captured is processed to discriminate between desired and undesired components of motion.
59372122c50f90cdd3ad3265	Developing cyber-physical systems involves multiple engineering domains, eg, timing, logical correctness, thermal resilience, and mechanical stress. In today's industrial practice, these domains rely on multiple analyses to obtain and verify critical system properties. Domain differences make the analyses abstract away interactions among themselves, potentially invalidating the results. Specifically, one challenge is to ensure that an analysis is never applied to a model that violates the assumptions of the analysis.

5936ffa0c50f90cdd3ad2168	A method and system for handling real-time indications of resource scheduling conflicts. In one embodiment, the method includes a computer system including a user interface, display, processor, and some form of memory. Contained within the memory is a resource scheduling process that analyzes resource data, scheduling criteria, and work parameters to create a working schedule. In conjunction with the creation of a working schedule, the scheduling process detects resource conflicts that can inhibit the schedule's functionality.
593723d5c50f90cdd3ad337e	Abstract—Designing cyber-physical systems (CPSs) increasingly requires the use of multi-domain models throughout the development process. Ensuring consistent relationships between various system models is an important part of an integrated design methodology. This paper describes an architectural approach to reasoning about relations between heterogeneous system models. The run-time base architecture of the system is used as a unifying representation to compare the structure and semantics of the associated models.
59372fe4c50f90cdd3ad386d	A novel materials handling system is being developed at Carnegie Mellon University's Mechanical Engineering Department. This systems contains an array of cells, each of which has two actuators. The two actuators are orthogonally oriented motorized roller wheels which, in combination, can generate a vector of motion in any planar direction. This work develops control laws for transporting and manipulating objects which rest on the array. Towards this goal, we consider the dynamics of parcel transport and manipulation.
59373080c50f90cdd3ad38ad	This paper proposes an approach to robust state estimation for mobile robots with intermittent dynamics. The approach consists of identifying the robot's mode of operation by classifying the output of onboard sensors into mode-specific contexts. The underlying technique seeks to efficiently use available sensor information to enable accurate, high-bandwidth mode identification. Context classification is combined with multiple-model filtering in order to significantly improve the accuracy of state estimates for hybrid systems.
593730cec50f90cdd3ad38cb	Abstract—In this paper, we develop a generic class of control policies that respect nonholonomic constraints and are provably safe with respect to obstacles for a convex-bodied mobile robot. We instantiate this class of policies over local regions of configuration space, and compose the resulting local policies to address the global navigation and control problem for a wheeled mobile robot navigating amongst obstacles. Simulation and experimental results are given.
59373225c50f90cdd3ad3957	The modular distributed manipulator system (MDMS) is a macroscopic actuator array which can manipulate objects in the plane. The piecewise-constant dynamics of manipulation on the MDMS are developed based on an exact discrete representation of the system. The resulting dynamics are inverted enabling the calculation of an open-loop vectorfield which provides arbitrary uniform object dynamics. The vector field positions, and under certain assumptions, orients objects.
593738c5c50f90cdd3ad3c00	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in only four of the tracks that were part of the TREC-7 workshop. We worked on ad-hoc retrieval, filtering, VLC, and the SDR track. This report covers the work done on each track successively. We start with a discussion of IR tools that were broadly applied in our work.
593739fec50f90cdd3ad3c7f	Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have emerged as a popular way to share huge volumes of data. The P2P paradigm holds many promises: it couples naturally with the Internet, the universal knowledge and service exchange medium; it favors scalability, by allowing the seamless plugging of data, services and computational resources into the global system; it increases system resilience, by avoiding unique points of failures; it can speed up global access by distributing the indexing and query processing tasks to multiple computing nodes.
59373a84c50f90cdd3ad3cba	Most solutions to distributed IR rely on access to a language model for each text collection, but it has been unclear how the model can be obtained reliably in real-world distributed environments. This paper proposes a solution based upon probing the collection, and demonstrates its effectiveness on four databases.
59373b00c50f90cdd3ad3cec	With thousands of DLs in the web, a user has to select relevant DLs (resource selection), reformulate the query wrt each DL (schema mapping) and reorganise the different results (data fusion). The EU project MIND attempts to overcome these ineffective manual tasks, giving the user the impression of dealing with a homogeneous multimedia DL, handling text, facts, images, and speech. All required steps are done automatically and invisible to a user.
59373e9dc50f90cdd3ad3e67	This paper presents the CMU submission to the 2008 TREC blog distillation track. Similar to last year's experiments, we evaluate different retrieval models and apply a query expansion method that leverages the link structure in Wikipedia. We also explore using a corpus that combines several different representations of the documents, using both the feed XML and permalink HTML, and apply initial experiments with spam filtering.
59373f33c50f90cdd3ad3ea4	This paper reports the experiments of using Indri for the main and routing (relevance feedback) tasks in the TREC 2007 Legal Track. For the main task, we analyze ranking algorithms using different fields, boolean constraints and structured operators. Evaluation results show that structured queries outperform bag-of-words ones. Boolean constraints improve both precision and recall. For the routing task, we train a linear SVM classifier for each topic. Terms with the largest weights are selected to form new queries.
593742ccc50f90cdd3ad401a	Authority-based approaches are widely used in expert retrieval from social media. However, most of these approaches are applied to either topic-independent networks, or more topic-dependent networks which still contain topic-irrelevant users as nodes and interactions as edges. Therefore, authority estimation over these graphs is still not topic-specific enough. This paper proposes a more topic-focused authority network construction approach which provides more effective topic-specific authority modeling of users.
593742efc50f90cdd3ad4028	The Open-Source IR Reproducibility Challenge brought together developers of open-source search engines to provide reproducible baselines of their systems in a common environment on Amazon EC2. The product is a repository that contains all code necessary to generate competitive ad hoc retrieval baselines, such that with a single script, anyone with a copy of the collection can reproduce the submitted runs. Our vision is that these results would serve as widely accessible points of comparison in future IR research.
593746afc50f90cdd3ad41b1	Wireless sensor networks (WSN) grows and gains new in our lives ranging from military applications to civilian ones. However security in WSN was not carefully carried out, since only some symmetric encryption based protocols are proposed in literature, under the assumption that the nature of sensor nodes does not support public key encryption due to the limitation in battery and CPU power. However...
59370a2ac50f90cdd3ad262c	The Distinguished Profiles in Data Management Column (edited by Marianne Winslett) features an interview of Surajit Chaudhuri, who is a research area manager at Microsoft Research, an ACM Fellow, and has received the SIGMOD Contributions Award in 2004. Read Surajit's interview to find out (among many other things) how data mining led him to self-tuning databases and about life as a research manager.
5937166bc50f90cdd3ad2dfd	We present a novel application of a neural network to augment manual precision by cancelling involuntary motion. This method may be applied in microsurgery, using either a telerobotic approach or active compensation in a handheld instrument. A feedforward neural network is trained to input the measured trajectory of a handheld tool tip and output the intended trajectory. Use of the neural network decreases rms error in recordings from four subjects by an average of 43.9%.
59371918c50f90cdd3ad2f14	Whether a task can be completed after a failure of one of the degrees-of-freedom of a redundant manipulator depends on the joint angle at which the failure takes place. It is possible to achieve fault tolerance by globally planning a trajectory that avoids unfavourable joint positions before a failure occurs. In this article, we present a trajectory planning algorithm that guarantees fault tolerance while simultaneously satisfying joint limit and obstacle avoidance requirements.
59372358c50f90cdd3ad334a	This paper outlines the new Core Curriculum of the Carnegie Mellon University Master of Software Engineering Program. Unlike most MSE curricula, which typically organize their courses around aspects of a software development lifecycle, this curriculum focuses on the cross-cutting disciplines of modelling, problem solving, management, analysis, and design.
593724bdc50f90cdd3ad33de	Language (ADL) with an implementation in ArchJava, an extension of the Java programming language that includes explicit architectural modeling constructs.
59372f5ec50f90cdd3ad3835	The scallop theorem posits that a two-link system immersed in a fluid at low Reynolds number cannot achieve any net translation via cyclic changes in its hinge angle. Here, we propose an approach to “breaking” this theorem, based on a static separation between the centers of mass and buoyancy in a net neutrally buoyant system. This separation gives the system a natural equilibrium orientation, allowing it to passively reorient without changing shape.
593735e9c50f90cdd3ad3ad1	A steerable multi-linked device. The device includes a first multi-linked mechanism and a second multi-linked mechanism. At least one of the first and second multi-linked mechanisms is steerable and includes a modular link assembly at an end thereof. The modular link assembly includes a base, and a tip removably connected to the base.
593739a9c50f90cdd3ad3c5c	In this demo we show how we can enhance real-time microblog search by monitoring news sources on Twitter. We improve retrieval through query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback. However, instead of doing feedback on the original corpus we use a separate Twitter news index. This allows the system to find additional terms associated with the original query to find more “interesting” posts.
59373bb9c50f90cdd3ad3d38	This paper presents a generative model of score distribution, focused on the case of information filtering, where sampling of training data is not random. Parameters of the model were estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Principle, conjugate priors, and conjugate gradient descent. Experiments on TREC8 and TREC9 Filtering Track datasets are reported. Our method obtained significant improvements compared to a baseline. 1.

59374029c50f90cdd3ad3f09	This short Project Highlight presents a year-end summary of a collaborative small grant for exploratory research. It relates the background and scope of current research plans by the eRulemaking Research Group. Finally, this Project Highlight notes the challenges for collaboration between social and information scientists.
593743ffc50f90cdd3ad4098	People are seldom aware that their search queries frequently mismatch a majority of the relevant documents. This may not be a big problem for topics with a large and diverse set of relevant documents, but would largely increase the chance of search failure for less popular search needs. We aim to address the mismatch problem by developing accurate and simple queries that require minimal effort to construct. This is achieved by targeting retrieval interventions at the query terms that are likely to mismatch relevant documents.
5937453ac50f90cdd3ad4119	Indexes for large collections are often divided into shards that are distributed across multiple computers and searched in parallel to provide rapid interactive search. Typically, all index shards are searched for each query. This paper investigates document allocation policies that permit searching only a few shards for each query (selective search) without sacrificing search quality. Three types of allocation policies (random, source-based and topic-based) are studied. K-means clustering is used to create topic-based shards.
593752dec50f90cdd3ad46ae	We describe our current work in developing novel mechanisms for managing security and privacy in pervasive computing environments. More specifically, we have developed and evaluated three different applications, including a contextual instant messenger, a people finder application, and a phone-based application for access control. We also draw out some themes we have learned thus far for user-controllable security and privacy.
593749f7c50f90cdd3ad4309	To support empirical study of online privacy policies, as well as tools for users with privacy concerns, we consider the problem of aligning sections of a thousand policy documents, based on the issues they address. We apply an unsupervised HMM; in two new (and reusable) evaluations, we find the approach more effective than clustering and topic models.
59374b0ec50f90cdd3ad437c	Data aggregators collect large amount of information about individual users and create detailed online behavioral profiles of individuals. Behavioral profiles benefit users by improving products and services. However, they have also raised concerns regarding user privacy, transparency of collection practices and accuracy of data in the profiles. To improve transparency, some companies are allowing users to access their behavioral profiles. In this work, we investigated behavioral profiles of users by utilizing these access mechanisms.
59375caac50f90cdd3ad4aa5	This symposium brings together a panel of researchers using contrasting case methodology to analyze computer-supported collaborative learning in a wide range of learning environments. Such analyses can help researchers better understand the differences in the collaborative processes by sharpening researchers' perception and facilitating the discovery of appropriate explanations for these differences.
5937612dc50f90cdd3ad4c7f	Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves collaborative learning environments that adapt their characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective.
59375bbfc50f90cdd3ad4a43	Multiple External Representations (MERs) have been used successfully in instructional activities, including fractions. However, students often have difficulties making the connections between the MERs spontaneously. We argue that interactive fraction representations may help students in discovering relevant features and relating the MERs to one another. Support for guiding student interaction is provided by example-tracing tutors.
59375c55c50f90cdd3ad4a80	Adding student collaboration to an intelligent tutoring system could leverage the beneﬁts of both approaches. We have incorporated a mutual peer tutoring script, where students of similar abilities take turns tutoring each other, into the Cognitive Tutor Algebra. In this paper, we identify three design principles for peer tutoring, and discuss how they were realized in our peer tutoring script. We then develop a cognitive model for peer tutoring, and drawing from student data, identify places for an intelligent tutor to provide feedback.
59375c7cc50f90cdd3ad4a8f	Combining peer tutoring with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) holds the promise of augmenting the current benefits of the ITS. We designed and implements a peer tutoring approach as a addition to the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA), an ITS for high school algebra. We then used 30 students to evaluate the potential of the peer tutoring addition to increase learning. Although students learned and interacted positively. peer tutors lacked the necessary expertise to adequately help their tutees.
59376637c50f90cdd3ad4e77	Many ICT initiatives that attempt to connect end-users to each other rely on Internet-connected PCs using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). While speech-based systems over the telephone have mushroomed in the West in the past decade, their potential remains largely untapped for use in the developing world. We present reasons why speech systems may be preferable to traditional PC/GUI systems in these circumstances, along with the needs such systems can fulfill.
59376e43c50f90cdd3ad51be	This paper presents improvements in acoustic and language modeling for automatic speech recognition. Specifically, semi-continuous HMMs (SCHMMs) with phone-dependent VQ codebooks are presented and incorporated into the SPHINX-II speech recognition system. The phone-dependent VQ codebooks relax the density-tying constraint in SCHMMs in order to obtain more detailed models. A 6% error rate reduction was achieved on the speaker-independent 20000-word Wall Street Journal (WSJ) task.
59377044c50f90cdd3ad5291	In the past year at Carnegie Mellon steady progress has been made in the area of acoustic and language modeling. The result has been a dramatic reduction in speech recognition errors in the SPHINX-II system. In this paper, we review SPHINX-II and summarize our recent efforts on improved speech recognition. Recently SPHINX-II achieved the lowest error rate in the November 1992 DARPA evaluations. For 5000-word, speaker-independent, continuous, speech recognition, the error rate was reduced to 5%.
593771a7c50f90cdd3ad5320	Health information access by low-literate community health workers is a pressing need of community health programs across the developing world. We present results from a needs assessment we conducted to understand the health information access practices and needs of various types of health workers in Pakistan. We also present a prototype for speech-based health information access, as well as discuss our experiences from a pilot study involving its use by community health workers in a rural health center.
593779a9c50f90cdd3ad5666	abstract When performing registrations, it is often crucial to maintain certain structure of the template data T-the data being deformed into the subject data S-as well as to keep the deformation field smooth. Current approaches to registration often impose smoothness through heuristic means, but building it into the model has proven to be more difficult due mainly to computational constraints.
59372befc50f90cdd3ad36cc	This paper investigates a novel minimalistic mechanism that ascends tubes. The mechanism is comprised of only a rigid body, two O-rings, and a motor rotating an eccentric mass. We describe the underlying locomotion principle of rocking and jamming, without the use of special bristles or spines, and demonstrate the robustness of this mechanism.
59372c8cc50f90cdd3ad370a	We present a method of estimating a snake robot's motion inside and outside of straight pipes using only knowledge of the robot's joint angles. We accomplish this by introducing a novel method to constructing a body frame for the robot that is aligned with the centerline of the pipe. In addition to greatly simplifying the motion model this method allows us to accurately estimate the diameter of the pipe. We present experimental results using a 16-DOF snake robot traversing the inside and outside of straight pipes.
59373543c50f90cdd3ad3a8e	This paper details the design and architecture of a series elastic actuated snake robot, the SEA Snake. The robot consists of a series chain of 1-DOF modules that are capable of torque, velocity and position control. Additionally, each module includes a high-speed Ethernet communications bus, internal IMU, modular electro-mechanical interface, and ARM based on-board control electronics.
59373c96c50f90cdd3ad3d92	The task of grouping word definitions from ESL (English as a Second Language) dictionaries based on the similarity of their meanings is the focus of this work. It is demonstrated that lexical features and unsupervised machine learning algorithms can be effectively used to approach this problem. Analysis of the efficacy of this methodology for this task and the involved data which consists of very short and very few definitions per group is provided.
59373f74c50f90cdd3ad3ec0	In this paper, we propose a single low-dimensional representation of a large collection of table and hyponym data, and show that with a small number of primitive operations, this representation can be used effectively for many purposes. Specifically we consider queries like set expansion, class prediction etc. We evaluate our methods on publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web.
593767ddc50f90cdd3ad4f1f	This paper discusses a variety of types of non-lexical signals such as beeps, prosodic variation and speaker style changes, and we consider four cases in which such signals might be used to good effect. We discuss the results of user tests to determine if specific types of non-lexical signals are better in some situations than in others, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using such signals.

59376bd6c50f90cdd3ad50be	We describe several language and pronunciation modeling techniques that were applied to the 1996 Hub 4 Broadcast News transcription task. These include topic adaptation, the use of remote corpora, vocabulary size optimization, n-gram cutoff optimization, modeling of spontaneous speech, handling of unknown linguistic boundaries, higher order n-grams, weight optimization in rescoring, and lexical modeling of phrases and acronyms.
59376ca6c50f90cdd3ad5113	We present an extension of Jaynes' maximum entropy principle to handle latent variables. We use an EM algorithm that incorporates nested iterative scaling to approximately calculate maximum entropy solutions for this principle, and give a proof of its convergence.
5937706bc50f90cdd3ad52a1	We describe our ongoing efforts at adaptive statistical language modeling. Central to our approach is the Maximum Entropy (ME) Principle, allowing us to combine evidence from multiple sources, such as long-distance triggers and conventional short-distance trigrams. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature.
593774c6c50f90cdd3ad5466	In this paper, we describe a single frame super-resolution technique for reconstructing high-resolution face images from their very low-resolution counterparts. Our technique is based on learning a subspace for high-resolution images in the transport space.
593781fdc50f90cdd3ad59eb	Objective: Plan aggressive trajectories in densely cluttered environments via a computationally tractable algorithm, resulting in a complete methodology that yields optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories. Challenges: Generating feasible and safe trajectories in cluttered environments is computationally expensive due to the need to consider a large number of obstacles.
59374d0dc50f90cdd3ad444d	Increased reliance on agile manufacturing techniques has created a demand for systems to solve integrated process planning and production scheduling problems in large scale dynamic environments. To be effective, these systems should provide user oriented interactive functionality for managing the various user tasks and objectives and reacting to unexpected events. This paper describes the mixed-initiative problem solving features of IP3S an Integrated Process Planning Production Scheduling shell for agile manufacturing.
59375021c50f90cdd3ad4590	This report is the specification for the Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management Game-TAC SCM-04, to be held between July 20-22, 2004, in New York in conjunction with AAMAS-04. Based on the experience of the 2003 Trading Agent Competition a few enhancements have been added to the original game:(1) The price function has been modified to better reflect demand;(2) storage costs have been introduced; and (3) customer demand has been segmented into multiple markets.
593750dac50f90cdd3ad45de	We present the results of an online survey of 1,221 Twitter users, comparing messages individuals regretted either saying during in-person conversations or posting on Twitter. Participants generally reported similar types of regrets in person and on Twitter. In particular, they often regretted messages that were critical of others. However, regretted messages that were cathartic/expressive or revealed too much information were reported at a higher rate for Twitter. Regretted messages on Twitter also reached broader audiences.
59375195c50f90cdd3ad4628	This article launches an international research challenge in the area of intelligent e-business. The challenge is to come up with a generic model and working solution that is able to (semi-) automatically map a given product description between two different e-commerce product classification standards.
593755e0c50f90cdd3ad47da	Based on experience with the 2003 and 2004 trading agent competitions, a few changes and \nenhancements have been made to the game, primarily in the supplier model. The supplier now \nreserves some portion of long-term capacity for future orders and requires down payments when \norders are placed. The supply “lottery” in which agents were randomly chosen for consideration \nby suppliers is eliminated. Agent requests are considered in parallel, and prices are determined \nby the total demand for supplies, not by the demand represented by an individual request.

59375c96c50f90cdd3ad4a9c	Chemistry students often learn to solve problems by applying well-practiced procedures, but such a mechanical approach is likely to hinder conceptual understanding. We have developed a system aimed at promoting conceptual learning in chemistry by having dyads collaborate on problems in a virtual laboratory (VLab), assisted by a collaboration script. We conducted a small study to compare an adaptive and a non-adaptive version of the system, with the adaptive version controlled by a human wizard.
593792f3c50f90cdd3ad60dd	This paper briefly presents two concepts of “RE”(1) re-empowering individuals using personal mobile technology reconstructed as measurement instruments and (2) re-cycle as a design constraint for extending a product's usable lifetime. In the first example we demonstrate the integration of simple low-cost, low-power air quality sensors attached to a mobile phone. In the re-cycle case, we demonstrate the extended re-use of mobile phones using them as toolkits for new duties.
59379474c50f90cdd3ad617c	Indoor air quality (IAQ) is important for health as people spend the majority of time indoors, and it is particularly interesting over outdoor air because it strongly ties to indoor activities. Some activities easily exacerbate IAQ, resulting in serious pollution. However, people may not notice such changes because many pollutants are colorless and odorless, while many activities are inconspicuous and routine. We implemented inAir, a system that measures and visualizes IAQ that households appropriate and integrate into everyday life.
593795d5c50f90cdd3ad620d	Drawing on a diverse body of literature from philosophy, design theory and other areas we have been developing a perspective on energy-as-materiality and employing a designerly approach of materializing energy [1]. Building on a framework for approaching energy as materiality, we discuss several design explorations around emotional attachment to energy and frame issues for future work related to energy, emotion and sustainable interaction design.
593796b8c50f90cdd3ad626a	This paper describes and explains details of the design, production and packaging of a counterfunctional device: The Obscura 1C Digital Camera. We further describe a small-scale distribution of Obscura 1C packages into everyday contexts. The paper then reflects on the various types of conceptual, imaginary and firsthand uses made of the Obscura 1C. These include its uses for everyday audiences as a unique camera and as a conceptually usable device. But we also prioritize uses particular to the HCI and design audience.
59378426c50f90cdd3ad5acc	Materials such as clothing or carpets, or complex assemblies of small leaves, flower petals, or mosses, do not fit well into either BRDF or BSSRDF models. Their appearance is a complex combination of reflection, transmission, scattering, shadowing, and inter-reflection. This complexity can be handled by simulating the full volumetric light transport within these materials by Monte Carlo algorithms, but there is no easy way to construct the necessary distributions of local material properties thatwould lead to the desired global appearance.
5937b501c50f90cdd3ad6ecb	This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.
5937b5e6c50f90cdd3ad6f28	Dr. Oscar Garcia joined the IRIS staff on September 1, 1992, as Program Director for the Interactive Systems Program, while he is on leave from the George Washington University. The previous program director, Dr. Johnson Hestenes, returns to Drexel University to resume his professiorial duties.
59379d81c50f90cdd3ad652c	Water is our most precious and most rapidly declining natural resource. We explore pervasive technology as an approach for promoting water conservation in public and private spaces. We hope to motivate immediate reduction in water use as well as higher-order behaviors (seeking new information, etc) through unobtrusive low-cost water flow sensing and several persuasive displays. Early prototypes were installed at public faucets and a private (shared) shower, logging water usage first without and then with ambient displays.
59379e44c50f90cdd3ad657a	Motivated by a recent surge of research related to energy and sustainability, this paper presents a review of energy-related work within HCI as well as from literature outside of HCI. Our review of energy-related HCI research identifies a central cluster of work focused on electricity consumption feedback (ECF). Our review of literature outside of HCI highlights a number of emerging energy systems trends of strong relevance to HCI and interaction design, including smart grid, demand response, and distributed generation technologies.
59379e9ac50f90cdd3ad659d	By attaching sensors to GPS-enabled cell phones, we can gather the raw data necessary to begin understand how urban air pollution impacts both individuals and communities. In this paper we introduce a hardware and software platform for exploring algorithms and data gathered from pollution sensors integrated into cell phones, and discuss our main research agenda going forward.
5937a04ac50f90cdd3ad664e	A locomotion device, such as a pogo stick, having a housing having a first end portion and a second end portion, a plunger being slideably connected to the housing second end portion, the leaf spring also pivotally attached to the plunger. A method for locomoting using such a device is also disclosed.
5937a0a9c50f90cdd3ad6675	The mobile robot programming problem is a software engineering challenge that is not easily conquered using contemporary software engineering best practices. We propose robot observability as a measure of the diagnostic transparency of a situated robot program, then describe property mapping as a simple, language-independent approach to implementing reliable robot programs by maximizing robot observability. Examples from realworld, working robots are given in Lisp and Java.
5937a143c50f90cdd3ad66b6	A method and system for handling real-time indications of resource scheduling conflicts. In one embodiment, the method includes a computer system including a user interface, display, processor, and some form of memory. Contained within the memory is a resource scheduling process that analyzes resource data, scheduling criteria, and work parameters to create a working schedule. In conjunction with the creation of a working schedule, the scheduling process detects resource conflicts that can inhibit the schedule's functionality.
5937a199c50f90cdd3ad66d9	Seven sensors were evaluated to determine their ability to detect obstacles at different distances and angles. The Polaroid 600 and 9000 sonar sensors and Sharp GP2D02 and GP2D12 infrared sensors were evaluated for eight materials and four obstacle widths. The Massa E152/40, Sonaswitch Mini-A, and Devantech SRF04 sonar sensors were evaluated for a single condition.
59376286c50f90cdd3ad4d06	This special issue comes amidst persistent and recently reignited debates about how and when to structure learning and problem-solving activities (Kirschner et al. 2006; Tobias and Duffy 2009). At the heart of the work reported in this special issue lies the incommensurability between learning and performance; that is, conditions that maximize performance in the short term may not necessarily be the ones that maximize learning in the long term (Schmidt and Bjork 1992). Two possibilities for designing instruction emerge.
59376a04c50f90cdd3ad5000	This paper discusses progress in designing a standardized interface for speech interaction with simple machines–the Universal Speech Interface (USI) project. We discuss the motivation for such a design and issues that must be addressed by such an interface. We present our current proposals for handling these issues, and comment on the usability of these approaches based on user interactions with the system. Finally, we discuss future work and plans for the USI project.
59376f67c50f90cdd3ad5236	Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses, that propagate over a social or other network. Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition: if a user buys product'A'(or gets infected with virus' X'), she will never buy product'B'(or virus' Y'). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers.

5937762dc50f90cdd3ad54f7	Disease in the brain is often associated with subtle, spatially diffuse, or complex tissue changes that may lie beneath the level of gross visual inspection, even on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unfortunately, current computer-assisted approaches that examine pre-specified features, whether anatomically-defined (ie thalamic volume, cortical thickness) or based on pixelwise comparison (ie deformation-based methods), are prone to missing a vast array of physical changes that are not well-encapsulated by these metrics.
59377aa8c50f90cdd3ad56d1	This report describes a new method for the detection of deterministic signals in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. The new method, based on recurrence plots, relies on a sliding-window technique combined with histogram analysis. Performance of the new approach is quantified in terms of receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. The report also provides background information on recurrence plots and ROC curves necessary to understand the new approach.
59378067c50f90cdd3ad5943	We describe a general framework for multi-channel image registration. A new similarity measure for registering two multi-channel images, each with an arbitrary number of channels, is proposed. Results show that image registration performed based on different channels generates different results. In addition, we show that, when available, the inclusion of multi-channel data in the registration procedure helps produce more accurate results.
593789dbc50f90cdd3ad5d24	As image-based surface reflectance and illumination gain wider use in physically-based rendering systems, it is becoming more critical to provide representations that allow sampling light paths according to the distribution of energy in these high-dimensional measured functions. In this paper, we apply algorithms traditionally used for curve approximation to reduce the size of a multidimensional tabulated Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) by one to three orders of magnitude without compromising its fidelity.
59378bf6c50f90cdd3ad5dff	In 1992, Barr et al. proposed a method for interpolating orientations with unit quaternion curves by minimizing covariant acceleration. This paper presents a simple improved method which uses cubic basis functions to achieve a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude. A new criterion for automatic refinement based on the Euler-Lagrange error functional is also introduced.
5937b9cdc50f90cdd3ad70c3	Systems, methods, and computer program products to detect a keyword in speech, by generating, from a sequence of spectral feature vectors generated from the speech, a plurality of blocked feature vector sequences, and analyzing, by a neural network, each of the plurality of blocked feature vector sequences to detect the presence of the keyword in the speech.
5937b9f4c50f90cdd3ad70d3	Synchrony is an essential aspect of human-human interactions. In previous work, we have seen how synchrony manifests in low-level acoustic phenomena like fundamental frequency, loudness, and the duration of keywords during the play of child-child pairs in a fast-paced, cooperative, language-based game. The correlation between the increase in such low-level synchrony and increase in enjoyment of the game suggests that a similar dynamic between child and robot co-players might also improve the child's experience.
5937bb35c50f90cdd3ad7156	We build turn-taking models for autonomous characters in language-based interactions with small groups of children. Two models explore the use of support vector machines given the same multimodal features, but different methods for collecting turn-taking labels.
5937bbd4c50f90cdd3ad7196	One avenue of research on conversational implicature (CI) in non-gurative discourse which should be addressed in the immediate future is to start implementing computational models of agents who, in the course of real-time conversational interaction, generate and comprehend conversational implicatures. This paper elaborates on this goal and describes how our current work serves as a stepping stone towards such a model.
5937c034c50f90cdd3ad735f	The goal of our work is to produce a process model account of education in microworlds based on Soar, a theory of cognition and learning. In the context of a microworld that supports the exploration of qualitative electrostatics, we present operational models of both skilled and student interaction. In addition, we describe an episodic memory mechanism encoded in the student model that gives insight into the processes involved in learning from incorrect behavior.
5937c1f9c50f90cdd3ad7417	For the last three years, the Soar/IFOR group has been developing intelligent forces for distributed interactive simulation environments. Since early 1994, our efforts have been focused on developing computer generated forces for air missions including both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. This paper reviews the current state of the Soar/IFOR project and discusses the results of a preliminary trial of our agents in STOW-E, a precursor to STOW-97.
5937c222c50f90cdd3ad7428	We describe the design of Simone Says an interactive software environment for language remediation that brings together research in speech recognition, natural language pro-cessing and computer-aided instruction. The underlying technology for the implementation and the system's eventual evaluation are also discussed.
5937c709c50f90cdd3ad762a	Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Data (QoD) are the two major dimensions for evaluating any query processing system. In the context of data stream management systems (DSMSs), multi-query scheduling has been exploited to improve QoS. In this paper, we are proposing to exploit query scheduling to improve QoD in DSMSs. Specifically, we are presenting a new policy for scheduling multiple continuous queries with the objective of maximizing the freshness of the output data streams and hence the QoD of such outputs.
5937a598c50f90cdd3ad687b	This paper presents a mobile robot localizer that detects topological transitions using a color vision-based classification system. After a two-step training process, the localization system is shown to achieve sufficient reliability to track the position of a mobile robot across two floors of an office building using purely discrete (non-probabilistic) update. Experimental results are based on an off-the-shelf electric wheelchair fitted with a parabolic color camera.
5937a5eac50f90cdd3ad68a0	In this paper, we present a simple approach to interleaving planning and execution based on the idea of making simplifying assumptions. Since assumptions can be tragically wrong, this assumptive approach must ensure both that the robot does not believe it has solved a problem when it has not and that it does not take steps that make a problem unsolvable. We present an assumptive algorithm that preserves goal-reachability and in addition we specify conditions under which the assumptive architecture is sound and complete.
5937a691c50f90cdd3ad68e5	In this paper we describe the results of a series of new robotics workshops for secondary school girls. Specifically we show that, over the course of a three-month pilot workshop, a group of eight girls showed engagement with the workshop content and gained technical knowledge. The Robot Diaries program is unique in that it creates a social narrative approach to robotics education. The robotic technology becomes a tool for expression and communication rather than the sole focus of the workshop.
5937a7c7c50f90cdd3ad6963	The second annual Robot Competition and Exhibition sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence was held in Washington DC on 13-15 July 1993 in conjunction with the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This article describes the robots that placed first and second in each event and compares their strategies and their resulting successes and difficulties.
5937a885c50f90cdd3ad69af	This paper describes a long-terra project to install socially interactive, autonomous mobile robots in public spaces. We have deployed four robots over the last three years, accumulating a total operational time of about six years. We introduce the robots, then focus on the lessons learned from one deployment to the next. The evolution of the robothuman interface is of particular interest, although other aspects of the robots' operations are briefly described.
5937a993c50f90cdd3ad6a1d	Despite the growing number of multi-agent software systems, relatively few physical systems have adopted multi-agent systems technology. Agents that interact with a dynamic physical environment have requirements not shared by virtual agents, including the need to transfer information about the world and their interaction with it. The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data.
5937a9cdc50f90cdd3ad6a36	In this paper, we summarize an approach for the dissemination of robotics technologies. In a manner analogous to the personal computer movement of the early 1980s, we propose that a productive niche for robotic technologies is as a long-term creative outlet for human expression and discovery. To this end, this paper describes our ongoing efforts to design, prototype and test a low-cost, highly competent personal rover for the domestic environment.
5937aa90c50f90cdd3ad6a87	Proposes a method for creating unique identifiers, called fingerprint sequences, for visually distinct locations by recovering statistically significant features in panoramic color images. Fingerprint sequences are expressive enough for mobile robot localization, as demonstrated using a minimum energy sequence-matching algorithm that is described. Empirical results in two different places demonstrate the reliability of the system for global localization on a Nomad Scout mobile robot.
5937dbfbc50f90cdd3ad7eba	We describe the use of machine learning and data mining to detect and classify malicious executables as they appear in the wild. We gathered 1,971 benign and 1,651 malicious executables and encoded each as a training example using n-grams of byte codes as features. Such processing resulted in more than 255 million distinct n-grams. After selecting the most relevant n-grams for prediction, we evaluated a variety of inductive methods, including naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, and boosting.
5937dcc8c50f90cdd3ad8052	Supplementary Table 1. Boosting fastqz. We ran fastqz on files in which the reads had been reordered by Mince to test the ability of Mince to prepare files to improve existing sequence compression schemes. Providing Mince-reordered files to fastqz results in a 4–50% reduction in the file size compared to providing fastqz with reads in their original order. This is further evidence that the Mince reordering is beneficial.
5937dd48c50f90cdd3ad8088	A multigraph is exactly k-edge-connected if there are exactly k edge-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices. We characterize the class of exactly 3-edge-connected graphs, giving a synthesis involving two operations by which every exactly 3-edge-connected multigraph can be generated. Slightly modified syntheses give the planar exactly 3-edge-connected graphs and the exactly 3-edge-connected graphs with the fewest possible edges.
5937dd72c50f90cdd3ad8099	Halin showed that every edge minimal, k-vertex connected graph has a vertex of degree k. In this note, we prove the analogue to Halin's theorem for edge-minimal, k-edge-connected graphs. We show there are two vertices of degree k in every edge-minimal, k-edge-connected graph.

5937e263c50f90cdd3ad82a2	Side-chain positioning is a central component of homology modeling and protein design. In a common formulation of the problem, the backbone is fixed, side-chain conformations come from a rotamer library, and a pairwise energy function is optimized. In [5], we showed that it is NP-complete to find even a reasonable approximate solution to this problem. Here, we explain, for non-computer scientists, the result in more detail.
59378e18c50f90cdd3ad5edf	Current systems for editing BRDFs typically allow users to adjust analytic parameters while visualizing the results in a simplified setting (eg unshadowed point light). This paper describes a real-time rendering system that enables interactive edits of BRDFs, as rendered in their final placement on objects in a static scene, lit by direct, complex illumination. All-frequency effects (ranging from near-mirror reflections and hard shadows to diffuse shading and soft shadows) are rendered using a precomputation-based approach.
59378e56c50f90cdd3ad5ef9	This paper describes a method for animating the appearance of clothing, such as pants or a shirt, that fits closely to a figure's body. Compared to flowing cloth, such as loose dresses or capes, these types of garments involve nearly continuous collision contact and small wrinkles, that can be troublesome for traditional cloth simulation methods. Based on the observation that the wrinkles in close-fitting clothing behave in a predominantly kinematic fashion, we have developed an example-based wrinkle synthesis technique.
5937ac5ec50f90cdd3ad6b46	This paper presents the results of an experiment in human-robot social interaction. Its purpose was to measure the impact of certain features and behaviors on people's willingness to engage in a short interaction with a robot. The behaviors tested were the ability to convey expression with a humanoid face and the ability to indicate attention by turning towards the person that the robot is addressing. We hypothesized that these features were minimal requirements for effective social interaction between a human and a robot.
5937acf9c50f90cdd3ad6b83	This paper presents a new appearance-based place recognition system for topological localization. The method uses a panoramic vision system to sense the environment. Color images are classified in real-time based on nearest-neighbor learning, image histogram matching, and a simple voting scheme. The system has been evaluated with eight cross-sequence tests in four unmodified environments, three indoors and one outdoors. In all eight cases, the system successfully tracked the mobile robot's position.
5937faaac50f90cdd3ad8c89	In this paper, we envision a world where a software engineer could take an existing software system, specify, for a set of properties of interest, an objective, conditions for change, and strategies for their adaptation and, within a few man weeks, make that system self-adaptive where it was not before. We describe how our approach generalizes to different classes of systems and holds promise for cost-effective, dynamic system self-adaptation to become an engineering reality.

593800c3c50f90cdd3ad8f0a	A software architecture should expose important system properties for consideration and analysis. Performancerelated properties are frequently of interest in determining the acceptability of a given software design. In this paper we show how queueing network modeling can be adapted to support performance analysis of software architectures. We also describe a tool for transforming a software architecture in a particular style into a queueing network and analyzing its performance.
5937af79c50f90cdd3ad6c8b	Landing pages associated with advertisements are partitioned into training landing pages and testing landing pages. Iterative training and testing of a classification mode on intrusion features of the partitioned landing pages is conducted until the occurrence of a cessation event. Feature weights are derived from the iterative training and testing, and are associated with the intrusion features. The associated feature weights and intrusion features can be used to classify other landing pages.

5937b15fc50f90cdd3ad6d51	We present compelling evidence that the World Wide Web is a domain in which applications can benefit from using first-order learning methods, since the graph structure inherent in hypertext naturally lends itself to a relational representation. We demonstrate strong advantages for two applications—learning classifiers for Web pages, and learning rules to discover relations among pages.
5937c6dfc50f90cdd3ad7619	We highlight the privacy issues that have arisen from the introduction of the Greek Social Security Number (AMKA), in connection with the availability of personally identifiable information on Greek web sites. In particular, we identify privacy problems with the current AMKA setup and present data from a web study we conducted in May 2009, exposing these problems. Given the anticipated ubiquity of AMKA in Greece in the future, along the lines of the Social Security Number in the US.
5937d311c50f90cdd3ad7b16	We propose a fast, simple low-rank method for solving the SDP relaxation of Maxcut problem, in which the complexity per iteration is linear in the number of edges. Experiments suggest that it always converges to global optima and is orders of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art low-rank methods. Specially, the proposed method is capable of solving problems involving millions of vertices.
5937de84c50f90cdd3ad8108	Carl Kingsford reviews R. Libeskind-Hadas and E. Bush's Computing for Biologists: Python Programming and Principles, declaring it good at avoiding intimidating students with unnecessary complexity while still providing a respectable programming and algorithmic introduction with a strong biology motivation.
5937bec6c50f90cdd3ad72c8	We present a retrospective view on our experience with small groups of more than 175 children (ages 4 to 10) playing versions of a language-based game hosted by an animated character. After describing the task, the audio-visual annotations used for modeling, and the regularities we see in the children's communicative behavior, we conclude with observations and challenges for other researchers interested in autonomous HCI and HRI with this population.
5937c8f6c50f90cdd3ad76f3	Graph partitioning and repartitioning have been widely used by scientists to parallelize compute-and dataintensive simulations. However, existing graph (re) partitioning algorithms usually assume homogeneous communication costs among partitions, which contradicts the increasing heterogeneity in inter-core communication in modern parallel architectures and is further exacerbated by increasing dataset sizes (ie, Big Data). To resolve this, we propose an architecture-aware graph repartitioner, called AragonLB.
5937ed1dc50f90cdd3ad8701	The maximum-urgency-first algorithm, which can be used to predictably schedule dynamically changing systems, is proposed. It is shown that it is a significant improvement over the rate monotonic algorithm, which can be used only to schedule static systems. The maximum-urgency-first scheduler has been implemented as the default scheduler of CHIMERA II, a real-time operating system being used to control sensor-based control systems.
5937f02bc50f90cdd3ad8842	This paper defines the property of kinematic fault tolerance and develops a general constructive proof of the existence of fault tolerant manipulators. After formulating the necessary and sufficient condition for fault tolerance, a planar manipulator with a minimal kinematic structure is designed. A generalization to spatial manipulators, using a numerical approach is formulated. Finally, it is shown how this approach enables us to solve the spatial design problem.
5937f12dc50f90cdd3ad88ac	This paper presents a novel algorithm for synthesizing and editing video of natural phenomena that exhibit continuous flow patterns. The algorithm analyzes the motion of textured particles in the input video along user-specified flow lines, and synthesizes seamless video of arbitrary length by enforcing temporal continuity along a second set of user-specified flow lines. The algorithm is simple to implement and use. We used this technique to edit video of water-falls, rivers, flames, and smoke.
5937f21cc50f90cdd3ad890f	The authors investigate dexterity measures of a manipulator based on its Jacobian matrix. The goal is to derive dexterity measures which can be used for both design and control of a manipulator. Generally, a dexterity measure must be independent of the scale of a manipulator for design, and must be expressed analytically so that it can be used for real-time control. Every dexterity measure must bear a physical meaning. The measure of manipulability has an analytical expression, but it depends on the scale of a manipulator.

5937f6e6c50f90cdd3ad8b04	We propose a primitive, called Pioneer, as a first step towards verifiable code execution on untrusted legacy hosts. Pioneer does not require any hardware support such as secure co-processors or CPU-architecture extensions. We implement Pioneer on an Intel Pentium IV Xeon processor. Pioneer can be used as a basic building block to build security systems. We demonstrate this by building a kernel rootkit detector.
5937caccc50f90cdd3ad77b5	Sensor networks are promising unprecedented levels of access to information about the physical world, in real time. Many areas of human activity are starting to see the benefits of utilizing sensor networks, in almost all such cases, sensor networks are statically deployed. The next evolutionary step for sensor networks is to handle mobility in all its forms. This panel aims to identify the benefits from such a step and recognize the resulting research challenges.
5937cd7cc50f90cdd3ad78cc	In this paper we propose a query-driven approach for tuning the time/energy trade-off in sensor networks with mobile sensors. The tuning factors include re-positioning of mobile sensors and changing their transmission ranges. We propose an algebraic query optimization framework that explores these factors while utilizing collision-free concurrent data transmissions with different degrees of data filtering and aggregation.
5937d001c50f90cdd3ad79da	The promise of data-driven decision-making is now being recognized broadly, and there is growing enthusiasm for the notion of``Big Data.''While the promise of Big Data is real--for example, it is estimated that Google alone contributed 54 billion dollars to the US economy in 2009--there is currently a wide gap between its potential and its realization.
5937f7b6c50f90cdd3ad8b59	Architecture evolution is a key feature of most software systems. There are few tools that help architects plan and execute these evolutionary paths. We demonstrate a tool to enable architects to describe evolution paths, associate properties with elements of the paths, and perform tradeoff analysis over these paths.
5937f948c50f90cdd3ad8bfb	As the design of software architectures emerges as a discipline within software engineering, it becomes increasingly important to support architectural description and analysis with tools and environments. This paper provides a brief introduction to Aesop, a set of tools for developing architectural design environments that exploit architectural styles to guide software architects in producing specific systems.
5937fa09c50f90cdd3ad8c49	In this paper, we argue that the reality of today's software systems requires us to consider uncertainty as a first-class concern in the design, implementation, and deployment of those systems. We further argue that this induces a paradigm shift, and a number of research challenges that must be addressed.
593806ccc50f90cdd3ad9185	Complete automation of trajectory planning tools for material deposition/removal applications has become increasingly necessary to reduce the “concept-to-consumer” timeline in product development. Segmentation of a complex automotive surfaces into topologically simple surfaces remains a barrier in the automation of trajectory generation. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical procedure to segment a complex automotive surface into geometrically as well as topologically simple components.
593806eac50f90cdd3ad9192	This paper presents a hybrid localization scheme for a mobile robot using the hierarchical atlas. The hierarchical atlas is a map that consists of a higher level topological graph with lower level feature-based metric submaps associated with the graph edges. Our method employs both a discrete Bayes filter and a Kalman filter to localize the robot in the map. This framework accommodates localization in a map with no prior information (global localization) and localization in a map with an incorrect pose estimate (kidnapped robot).
5938079ac50f90cdd3ad91da	This paper overviews path planning methods, systematic versus probabilistic for robotic demining, and a robot development project. We outline a complete sensor-based coverage algorithm that uses an exact cellular decomposition method. To decrease coverage duration, we introduce a probabilistic method that takes advantage of a priori known mine patterns. Then, we give a comparison of random versus coordinated coverage. Finally, we present a summary of the development of the mobile test platform.
59380969c50f90cdd3ad9295	This paper presents a novel compact design for a two degrees of freedom (DOF) joint mechanism. The joint is optimized for compactness, strength and range of motion which makes it ideal for constructing spatial or three-dimensional hyper redundant robots. We also identify and classify various prior joint designs that led to the development of this new concept. Finally, we present the joint forward kinematics, and force and torque calculations to verify the joint's range of motion and mechanical advantage.
5937df13c50f90cdd3ad8143	The year 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the RECOMB (REsearch in Computational Molecular Biology) conference. On this occasion, we collect some facts and statistics about the conference's papers, authors, speakers, reviewers, and organizers. These data provide a succinct summary of the RECOMB conference over the last decade and can serve as a starting point for introspection and discussion about the future of the conference.
5937e54ec50f90cdd3ad83cf	We introduce Sequence Bloom Trees, a method for querying thousands of short-read sequencing experiments by sequence 485 times faster than existing approaches. The approach searches large data archives for all experiments that involve a given sequence. We use Sequence Bloom Trees to search 2652 human blood, breast, and brain RNA-seq experiments for all 214,293 known transcripts in under 4 days using less than 239 MB of RAM and a single CPU.
5937e5d9c50f90cdd3ad8409	Overlapping genes are a common phenomenon. Among sequenced prokaryotes, more than 29% of all annotated genes overlap at least 1 of their 2 flanking genes. We present a unified model for the creation and repair of overlaps among adjacent genes where the 3′ ends either overlap or nearly overlap. Our model, derived from a comprehensive analysis of complete prokaryotic genomes in GenBank, explains the nonuniform distribution of the lengths of such overlap regions far more simply than previously proposed models.
5937e785c50f90cdd3ad84b9	Background In April 2009, novel swine-origin influenza viruses (S-OIV) were identified in patients from Mexico and the United States. The viruses were genetically characterized as a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain originating in swine, and within a very short time the S-OIV strain spread across the globe via human-to-human contact.
5937f475c50f90cdd3ad8a06	This article describes a simple control strategy for stable hard-on-hard contact of a manipulator with the environment. The strategy is motivated by recognition of the equivalence of pro portional gain explicit force control and impedance control. It is shown that negative proportional force gains, or impedance mass ratios less than unity, can equivalently provide excel lent impact response without bouncing. This result is indicated by an analysis performed with an experimentally determined arm/sensor/environment model.
5937f4cdc50f90cdd3ad8a2a	A rapidly deployable manipulator system combines the flexibility of reconfigurable modular hardware with modular programming tools, allowing the user to rapidly create a manipulator which is custom-tailored for a given task. This article describes two main aspects of such a system, namely, the reconfigurable modular manipulator system (RMMS) hardware and the corresponding control software.
59380be8c50f90cdd3ad939b	As part of a rigorous robotics curriculum at Carnegie Mellon University, the authors have developed and implemented open-ended design and construction lab experiences. The hands-on, heads-on laboratory component to the new robotics course described provides a self-learning experience for engineering and computer science undergraduates, enriching their robotics education and teaching interdisciplinary teamwork.
59380c86c50f90cdd3ad93db	This paper describes the procedures that are required to implement, on a conventional mobile robot, a sensor based motion planning algorithm based on the generalized Voronoi graph (GVG). The GVG is a roadmap of a static environment, and we describe how to incrementally construct this roadmap using only range information in an unknown environment. The GVG may then be used to guide future excursions into the explored environment. Experimental results validate the utility of this work.
593819b7c50f90cdd3ad993d	This paper presents our system and results for the Feed Distillation task in the Blog track at TREC 2007. Our experiments focus on two dimensions of the task:(1) a large-document model (feed retrieval) vs. a small-document model (entry or post retrieval) and (2) a novel query expansion method using the link structure and link text found within Wikipedia.
59381ab2c50f90cdd3ad99c8	In TREC 11, our group participated in the Novelty track, Filtering track, and the Named-Page Finding task of the Web track. This paper describes our approaches, experiments, and results. As the approach for each task is quite different, the paper contains a section for each of the tasks. The following section describes our experiments in adaptive filtering, Section 3 describes named-page finding, and section 4 discusses the Novelty track.
59381c81c50f90cdd3ad9a8e	Experiments using hierarchical language models for XML component retrieval are presented in this paper. The role of context is investigated through incorporation of the parent's model. We find that context can improve the effectiveness of finding relevant components slightly. Additionally, biasing the results toward long components through the use of component priors improves exhaustivity but harms specificity, so care must be taken to find an appropriate trade-off.
59381cbac50f90cdd3ad9aa4	This paper examines the problems of learning queries and dissemination thresholds from relevance feedback in a dynamic information filtering environment. It revisits the EG algorithm for learning queries, identifying several problems in using it reliably for information filtering, and providing solutions. It also presents a new algorithm for learning dissemination thresholds automatically, from the same relevance feedback information used to learn queries.
59381f8ac50f90cdd3ad9bcc	In this paper, we present a new method of using statistical models to estimate readability [1]. Language Model is used to capture the content information. It is combined with linguistic feature model by a linear form. Experiments show that this new method has a better performance than the widely used Flesch-Kincaid readability formula.

593822fdc50f90cdd3ad9d34	Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number and importance in daily life of mobile devices. The security properties that these devices provide to their applications, however, are inadequate to protect against many undesired behaviors. A broad class of such behaviors is violations of simple information-flow properties. This paper proposes an enforcement system that permits Android applications to be concisely annotated with information-flow policies, which the system enforces at run time.
59380325c50f90cdd3ad9006	Architectural styles, object-oriented design and design patterns all hold promise as approaches that simplify software design and reuse by capturing and exploiting system design knowledge. This article explores the capabilities and roles of the various approaches, their strengths and their limitations.
59380364c50f90cdd3ad901f	Traditional mechanisms that allow a system to detect and recover from errors are typically wired into applications at the level of code where they are hard to change, reuse, or analyze. An alternative approach is to use externalized adaptation: one or more models of a system are maintained at run time and external to the application as a basis for identifying problems and resolving them. In this paper we provide an overview of recent research in which we use architectural models as the basis for such problem diagnosis and repair.
593803a0c50f90cdd3ad9038	A critical issue for complex component-based systems design is the modeling and analysis of architecture. One of the complicating factors in developing architectural models is accounting for systems whose architecture changes dynamically (during run time). This is because dynamic changes to architectural structure may interact in subtle ways with on-going computations of the system.
5938043dc50f90cdd3ad9077	Since the early 1960s, the notion of context has been modeled and exploited in many areas \nof informatics. The scientific community has debated definitions and uses for many years without \nreaching clear consensus [4]. Nonetheless, it is commonly agreed that context is about \nevolving, structured, and shared information spaces, and that such spaces are designed to serve \na particular purpose. In ubiquitous computing, the purpose is to amplify human activities with \nnew services that can adapt to the circumstances in which they are used.
593804bbc50f90cdd3ad90ad	Why isn't there more progress toward building systems from existing parts? One answer is that the assumptions of the parts about their intended environment are implicit and either don't match the actual environment or conflict with those of other parts. The authors explore these problems in the context of their own experience with a compositional approach.
593807e8c50f90cdd3ad91f9	Probabilistic planners such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) are powerful path planning algorithms for high dimensional systems, but even these potent techniques suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as can be seen in multirobot systems. In this paper, we apply a technique called subdimensional expansion in order to enhance the performance of probabilistic planners for multirobot path planning. We accomplish this by exploiting the structure inherent to such problems.
5938438dc50f90cdd3adaa2b	In this appendix we provide some additional experiments regarding the under-fitting property of GP maximum marginal likelihood estimation of kernel length-scales. We also provide instructions and some questions asked in the human experiments. To participate in the exact experiments, and view demonstrations, see http://www. functionlearning. com.

We also provide the instructions and some of the questions asked in the human experiments. To participate in the exact experiments, and additional resources, see http://www. functionlearning. com.
59384420c50f90cdd3adaa67	Table 2 shows the complete results of various LSSVMmodels on the bAbI datasets for each subtask. In our experiments, we observed a similar general pattern of improvement of LSSVM over the baselines as well as the improvement due to multi-task learning. Again task classification helped the multi-task learner the most and the QA classification helped more than the QClassification. The results on performance within the subtasks described in the main paper are substantiated by these numbers.
5938449ec50f90cdd3adaa9a	To initialize w (x) defined by RKS features we first simplify our change surface model and assume that each latent function f1,..., fr from Eq. 8 is drawn from a Gaussian process with an RBF kernel. Since RBF kernels have many fewer hyperparameters than spectral mixture kernels, this enables the initialization to focus on w (x). Algorithm 2 provides the procedure for initializing this simplified change surface model. Note that depending on the application domain, a model with latent functions defined by RBF kernels may be sufficient.
59384538c50f90cdd3adaad9	The supplementary material is organized as follows. In section 1, we provide an illustration of the model (section 1.1), the derivation of the Gibbs sampler (section 1.2) and the gradient descent updating rule (section 1.3). Section 2 gives more details on the feature design and extraction. As supplementary to the paper, section 3 discloses more implementation details for reproducibility, including the word embedding training (section 3.1) and discussion on the implementation efficiency (section 3.2).
593826bcc50f90cdd3ad9ebb	In this article, we first introduce the methodology for our recent work on password-composition policies [5, 6] and password meters [8], and define the metrics we used to measure the security and usability of passwords. We then highlight key results from these studies, paying particular attention to the lessons they hold for guiding real-world password creation.
59382ac3c50f90cdd3ada057	Although many users create predictable passwords, the extent to which users realize these passwords are predictable is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between users' perceptions of the strength of specific passwords and their actual strength. In this 165-participant online study, we ask participants to rate the comparative security of carefully juxtaposed pairs of passwords, as well as the security and memorability of both existing passwords and common password-creation strategies.
59382e72c50f90cdd3ada1ca	We describe our current work in developing novel mechanisms for managing security and privacy in pervasive computing environments. More specifically, we have developed and evaluated three different applications, including a contextual instant messenger, a people finder application, and a phone-based application for access control. We also draw out some themes we have learned thus far for user-controllable security and privacy.
59382f59c50f90cdd3ada227	We describe the design of Grey, a set of software extensions that convert an off-the-shelf smartphone-class device into a tool by which its owner exercises and delegates her authority to both physical and virtual resources. We focus on the software components and user interfaces of Grey, highlighting the features of each. We also discuss an initial case study for Grey, in which we are equipping over 65 doors on two floors of office space for access control using Grey-enabled devices, for a population of roughly 150 persons.
59384680c50f90cdd3adab5e	Abstract—An electrolarynx is a device that artificially generates excitation sounds to produce electrolaryngeal (EL) speech. Although proficient laryngectomees can produce intelligible EL speech by using this device, it sounds quite unnatural due to the mechanical excitation. To address this issue, we have proposed several EL speech enhancement methods using statistical voice conversion and showed that statistical prediction of excitation parameters, such as F0 patterns, was essential to significantly improve naturalness of EL speech.

59384e0bc50f90cdd3adae69	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have recently become popular as a tool for identifying genetic variables that are responsible for increased disease susceptibility. A modern statistical method for approaching this problem is through model selection (or structure estimation) of Structured Input-Output Regression Models (SIORM) fitted on genetic and phenotypic variation data across a large number of individuals.
59384f2dc50f90cdd3adaee1	Training large machine learning (ML) models with many variables or parameters can take a long time if one employs sequential procedures even with stochastic updates. A natural solution is to turn to distributed computing on a cluster; however, naive, unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms does not usually lead to a proportional speedup and can even result in divergence, because dependencies between model elements can attenuate the computational gains from parallelization and compromise correctness of inference.

59385257c50f90cdd3adb02d	Matrix-parametrized models (MPMs) are widely used in machine learning (ML) applications. In large-scale ML problems, the parameter matrix of a MPM can grow at an unexpected rate, resulting in high communication and parameter synchronization costs. To address this issue, we offer two contributions: first, we develop a computation model for a large family of MPMs, which share the following property: the parameter update computed on each data sample is a rank-1 matrix, ie the outer product of two “sufficient factors”(SFs).
5938547ac50f90cdd3adb10d	● Pedigree analyses usually suppose that, given the genotype at all loci, and in some cases age and sex, the chance of having a particular phenotype depends only on genotype at one locus, and is independent of all other factors: genotypes at other loci, environment, genotypes and phenotypes of relatives, etc.
59385858c50f90cdd3adb2a2	We summarize the overview of our approach in Algorithm 1. The step 2–3 describe the alignment of multiple photo streams, and the step 4–6 outline the large-scale cosegmentation. We can iterate running these two major procedures until the output converges or maximum iterations reach.
5938346ac50f90cdd3ada410	ATAC is a new 1000-core multicore computing system that leverages recent advances in nanophotonics to communicate values between cores. The cores within the ATAC chip can communicate almost instantaneously given the low latency and high bandwidth properties of optical communications. This global communication infrastructure will improve performance, energy efficiency and programmability of large scale multicores.
593838afc50f90cdd3ada5bf	Systems with high dependability requirements are increasingly relying on complex on-line fault management systems to function in a wide range of scenarios. Fault management systems involve a combination of multiple steps–monitoring, data analysis, planning and execution–that are typically independently developed and optimized. We argue that it is inefficient and ineffective to improve any particular fault management step without taking into account its interactions and dependencies with the rest of the steps.
59383b0cc50f90cdd3ada6b5	概要: 従来の音声翻訳システムでは発話から合成までに生じる遅延が大きく, ニュースや講演の内容をリアルタイムで理解することが困難である. そこで, 本研究では音声翻訳システムの遅延の原因として考えられる機械翻訳モジュールの開始時間および処理時間の改善を図る. 具体的にはフレーズベース機械翻訳のフレーズテーブルを用いて, 翻訳単位を短くする方法を提案し, 翻訳の精度と同時性への影響を調査する. 実験的評価により, 翻訳開始および翻訳処理の時間が減少させることができることを確認した.
59383bdcc50f90cdd3ada709	We have attempted to devise an agent capable of learning a controller for sustained hovering insect flight. We introduce agent architectures for POMDPs that rely on a locally weighted value function approximator and an inputoutput linear dynamical system for state approximation and action selection. We discuss the computational and numerical issues introduced by our architectural decisions, survey the results of our experiments, and speculate on future directions for this work.

59385e70c50f90cdd3adb51b	While machine translation has been a long-held dream dating back to the appearance of the \nfirst computers, for many years it had not reached a level that was able to stand up to real \nuse. However, over the past ten or so years, there have been huge advances in the \ntechnology, and machine translation is finally seeing large-scale use in real situations. This paper \ndescribes 5 major elements that have contributed to these enormous steps forward in machine \ntranslation systems.
593860c5c50f90cdd3adb614	In this paper, we propose a method for avoiding digressions in discussion by detecting unnecessary utterances and having a dialogue system intervene. The detector is based on the features using word frequency and topic shifts. The performance (ie accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure) of the unnecessary utterance detector is evaluated through leave-one-dialogue-out cross-validation. In the evaluation, we find that the performance of the proposed detector is higher than that of a typical automatic summarization method.

59383f6ec50f90cdd3ada87d	1. The first is network plots of the latent variable tree learned by [1] for the stock market data, and the Chow Liu tree to give a more intuitive explanation why latent variable trees can lead to better performance. 2. The second is a more detailed representation of the tensor representation where internal nodes are allowed to be evidence variables. 3. The third is the proof of Theorem 1.
59383fe6c50f90cdd3ada8af	The observable representation exists only if there exist transformations Pi= P [Oi| Si] with rank τi:= kh×| Si| and P [O− i| Si] also has rank τi (so that P (Oi, Oi−) has rank τi). Thus, it is required that# states (Oi)≥# states (Si). This can either be achieved by either making Oi consist of a few high dimensional observations, or many smaller dimensional ones. In the case when# states (Oi)># states (Si), we need to project Pi to a lower dimensional space such that it can be inverted using a tensor ci. In this case, we define Pi:= P [Oi| Si]× Oi ci].

Let u (x, t; S) be the temperature at position x at time t when identical heat sources are attached to S (⊂ Ω). Then, the following statements hold for∀ x∈ Ω,∀ t∈[0,∞].
5938416dc50f90cdd3ada94c	We introduce a new dataset called FlickrMFC for the benchmark purpose of multiple foreground cosegmentation. They are sampled images from Flickr photostreams, each of which is taken by a single user for a specific event in a single day. Hence, a fixed number of subjects (or foregrounds) frequently occur across the photostream, but an unknown subset of them appears in every single image. We also provide hand-labeled pixel-level ground truths. The FlickrMFC consists of 14 groups, each of which contains 12∼ 20 images.

5938658fc50f90cdd3adb808	Semantic parsing (SP) is the problem of parsing a given natural language (NL) sentence into a meaning representation (MR) conducive to further processing by applications. One of the major challenges in SP stems from the fact that NL is rife with ambiguities. Previous works using statistical models along with formalisms such as combinatorial categorial grammars, synchronous context free grammars, and dependency-based compositional semantics have shown notable success in resolving these ambiguities [7, 9, 12, 11, 14].
593866a1c50f90cdd3adb879	The multi-design multi-response linear regression problem is investigated, in which design matrices are Gaussian with covariance matrices Σ (1: K)=(Σ (1),..., 1 (K)) for K linear regression tasks. Design matrices across tasks are assumed to be independent. The support union of K p-dimensional regression vectors (collected as columns of matrix B*) is recovered using l 1/l 2-regularized lasso. Sufficient and necessary conditions on sample complexity are characterized as a sharp threshold to guarantee successful recovery of the support union.
59386c75c50f90cdd3adbb29	The kernel-based nonparametric approach proposed by Nguyen, Wainwright, and Jordan is further investigated for decentralized detection. In contrast with the uniform kernel used in the previous work, a weighted kernel is proposed, where weight parameters serve to selectively incorporate sensors' information into the fusion center's decision rule based on quality of sensors' observations. Furthermore, weight parameters also serve as sensor selection parameters with nonzero parameters corresponding to sensors being selected.
59386db0c50f90cdd3adbbc7	In this paper, we propose combining augmented Lagrangian optimization with the dual decomposition method to obtain a fast algorithm for approximate MAP (maximum a posteriori) inference on factor graphs. We also show how the proposed algorithm can efficiently handle problems with (possibly global) structural constraints. The experimental results reported testify for the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach.
59386eb5c50f90cdd3adbc4d	We provide a solution for elementary science test using instructional materials. We posit that there is a hidden structure that explains the correctness of an answer given the question and instructional materials and present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs and instructional materials), and uses what it learns to answer novel elementary science questions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms several strong baselines.
5939b141c50f90cdd3ae34cc	In this poster, we present our work concerning indoor location, based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) footprints. Our location method is support on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). In this way previous footprints, with the corresponding locations are treated as cases in memory and a new footprint is used as a probe to locate it. We describe the results obtained with data gathered along two floors at our department.
5939b303c50f90cdd3ae3568	RoboSoccer is a multi-agent framework in which mul-tiple robots collaborate in an adversarial environment. RoboSoccer can be built with robots and fields of dif-ferent sizes. ln the smallest version of the game, robots cannot incorporate on-board full autonomous capa-bilities. In particular, vision processing is off-board, centralized, and connected to the individual clients that control the robots. The vision system needs to overview the complete field and to compute in real time positioning information for the moving ball and players.
5939b3ddc50f90cdd3ae35b3	The analysis and development of a novel approach to asphalt pavement modeling, able to attend the need to predict the failure according to technical and non-technical criteria in a highway, is a hard task, namely in terms of the huge amount of possible scenarios. Indeed, the current state-of-the-art for service-life prediction is at empiric and empiric–mechanistic levels, and does not provide any...
5939b640c50f90cdd3ae36be	UMOP (Jensen 2000; Jensen & Veloso 2000; Jensen, Veloso, & Bowling 2001) is a universal planning system for multi-agent and non-deterministic domains. As input UMOP takes a planning problem described in the Nondeterministic Agent Domain Language (NADL). The NADL problem is translated to a search problem in a finite transition system. The transition system is represented by a conjunctive partitioned transition relation encoded symbolically as a set of reduced ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)(Bryant 1986).
5939b713c50f90cdd3ae3723	We present CAMEO, the Camera Assisted Meeting Event Observer, which is a physical awareness system designed for use by an agent-based electronic assistant. CAMEO is used to observe formal meeting environments and infer the activities of people attending them.
5939b88dc50f90cdd3ae37c9	The Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence was held July 9-13, 2005, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The conference, which marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), received 803 submissions to the technical program. All papers were double-blind reviewed, and 150 papers were accepted for oral presentation, while 79 papers were accepted for poster presentation. The keynote address was delivered by Marvin Minsky.
5939b97ac50f90cdd3ae3834	We define the Extended Incremental Multiagent Agreement Problem with Preferences (EIMAPP). In EIMAPP, variables arise over time. For each variable, a set of distributed agents receives reward for agreeing on which option to assign to the variable. Each of the agents has an individual, privately owned preference function for choosing options. EIMAPPs reflect real world multiagent agreement problems, including multiagent meeting scheduling and task allocation. We analyze negotiation in EIMAPP theoretically.
5939db1bc50f90cdd3ae9782	The ATT-CMUnited-2000 simulator team finished in third place at Robocup-2000. It was one of only three teams to finish ahead of the previous year's champion, CMUnited-99. In controlled experiments, ATT-CMUnited-2000 beats CMUnited-99 by an average score of 2.6-0.2.
59380a4cc50f90cdd3ad92f1	Sensor based planning for rod-shaped robots is necessary for the realistic deployment of noncircular symmetric robots into unknown environments. To this end, the rod hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (rod-HGVG), introduced in this paper, is a roadmap for rod-like robots. A key feature of this roadmap is that it can be incrementally constructed using distance (range) information. This planning paradigm is an extension of previous work on sensor based planning for point robots.
593873b6c50f90cdd3adc077	Carbonell's seminal 1978 paper on the POLITICS system for automated ideological reasoning demonstrated a vision so bold that, for over two decades, almost no one has attempted to improve upon it. Here, we argue that the time is ripe for a new approach to automated ideological reasoning, and we propose a new system, CARBONELL. Recent developments in quantitative political science and statistical machine learning for text will enable the original goals of POLITICS to be satisfactorily achieved.
59387472c50f90cdd3adc0d9	For FOREST, SG, and NCE with M= 520, we project the learned word representations into two dimensions using the t-SNE tool (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) from http://homepage. tudelft. nl/19j49/t-SNE. html. We show projections of words related to the concept “good” vs.“bad” and “man” vs.“woman” in Figure 1.
5938770ec50f90cdd3adc22a	This is a full annotation of a sentence in terms of its frames/arguments. Note that this is a* partial* semantic representation: it shows a certain amount of relational meaning but doesn't encode, for instance, that “as if he had been stung” is a hypothetical used to provide imagery for the manner of motion (we infer that it must have been rapid and brought upon by a shocking stimulus).
59387769c50f90cdd3adc25e	5 Summary Table 1 summarizes the performance of our Korean-English system under various conditions. We report scores on the development set used by minimum error rate training since we did not have enough data to produce a reliable test set. Without segmentation of the eojeol, the system performs quite poorly, due largely to large numbers of OOV items in the output.
5938781dc50f90cdd3adc2ba	Recurrent neural network grammars (RNNG) are a recently proposed probabilistic generative modeling family for natural language. They show state-of-the-art language modeling and parsing performance. We investigate what information they learn, from a linguistic perspective, through various ablations to the model and the data, and by augmenting the model with an attention mechanism (GA-RNNG) to enable closer inspection. We find that explicit modeling of composition is crucial for achieving the best performance.
593878dcc50f90cdd3adc318	This paper describes University of Washington NLP's submission for the Linking Models of Lexical, Sentential and Discourse-level Semantics (LSDSem 2017) shared task—the Story Cloze Task. Our system is a linear classifier with a variety of features, including both the scores of a neural language model and style features. We report 75.2% accuracy on the task. A further discussion of our results can be found in Schwartz et al.(2017).
59387908c50f90cdd3adc32e	Few studies have demonstrated the use of mixed methods research to contextualize health topics using primary data from social media. To address this gap in the methodological literature, we present research about electronic nicotine delivery systems, using Twitter data from “World Vaping Day.” To engage with the quantitative breadth and qualitative depth of 5,149 collected tweets, we utilized a convergent parallel mixed methods framework, integrating thematic prevalence estimates with phenomenological contextualization.
593879bfc50f90cdd3adc38d	We present a shared logistic normal distribution as a Bayesian prior over probabilistic grammar weights. This approach generalizes the similar use of logistic normal distributions [3], enabling soft parameter tying during inference across different multinomials comprising the probabilistic grammar. We show that this model outperforms previous approaches on an unsupervised dependency grammar induction task.
593879ddc50f90cdd3adc399	Prior approaches to sentence compression have taken low level syntactic constraints into account in order to maintain grammaticality. We propose and successfully evaluate a more comprehensive, generalizable feature set that takes syntactic and structural relationships into account in order to sustain variable compression rates while making compressed sentences more coherent, grammatical and readable.
59387ad1c50f90cdd3adc415	We propose a fast and scalable method for semi-supervised learning of sequence models, based on anchor words and moment matching. Our method can handle hidden Markov models with feature-based log-linear emissions. Unlike other semi-supervised methods, no decoding passes are necessary on the unlabeled data and no graph needs to be constructed—only one pass is necessary to collect moment statistics. The model parameters are estimated by solving a small quadratic program for each feature.
59387b9dc50f90cdd3adc480	構文情報を考慮する機械翻訳手法である統語ベース翻訳では, 構文解析器の精度が翻訳精度に大きな影響を与えることが知られている. また, 構文解析の精度向上を図る手法の一つとして, 構文解析器の出力を学習データとして用いる構文解析器の自己学習が提案されている. しかし, 構文解析器が生成する構文木には誤りが存在することから, 自動生成された構文木が常に精度向上に寄与するわけではない. そこで本論文では, 機械翻訳における自動評価尺度を用いて, このような誤った構文木を学習データから取り除き, 自己学習の効果を向上させる手法を提案する.

59387e97c50f90cdd3adc5cf	Embodiments generally relate to machine translation. In one embodiment, a method includes receiving a sentence of a source language. The method also includes parsing the sentence into words. The method also includes determining scores for the words, where each score is associated with features of each respective word. The method also includes reordering the words based on the scores.
59387fc7c50f90cdd3adc64e	This paper presents NTT-NAIST SMT systems for English-German and German-English MT tasks of the IWSLT 2013 evaluation campaign. The systems are based on generalized minimum Bayes risk system combination of three SMT systems: forest-to-string, hierarchical phrase-based, phrasebased with pre-ordering. Individual SMT systems include data selection for domain adaptation, rescoring using recurrent neural net language models, interpolated language models, and compound word splitting (only for German-English).
59388110c50f90cdd3adc6d6	An electrolarynx is a device that artificially generates excitation sounds to produce electrolaryngeal (EL) speech. Although proficient laryngectomees can produce intelligible EL speech by using this device, it sounds quite unnatural due to the mechanical excitation. To address this issue, we have proposed several EL speech enhancement methods using statistical voice conversion and showed that statistical prediction of excitation parameters, such as F 0 patterns, was essential to significantly improve naturalness of EL speech.

59388a1bc50f90cdd3adca86	Studies of Internet censorship rely on an experimental technique called probing. From a client within each country under investigation, the experimenter attempts to access network resources that are suspected to be censored, and records what happens. The set of resources to be probed is a crucial, but often neglected, element of the experimental design.

59388efcc50f90cdd3adcc85	We consider a 2-class queueing system, operating under a generalized processor-sharing discipline. The arrival rate to the secondary queue is much smaller than that to the primary queue, while the exponentially distributed service requirements have comparable parameters. The primary queue is assumed to be heavily loaded, so the processor-sharing factor for the secondary queue is assumed to be relatively...
593891eac50f90cdd3adcdb8	We prove that a Markovian Open Queueing Network in which the service times are constant has lower average packet delay than the same network in which the service times are exponential with the same mean. The proof is elementary, generalizing a similar result of Stamoulis and Tsitsiklis by removing the requirement that the network be layered.

593899c2c50f90cdd3adcffd	Bag of feature (BoF) representations are omnipresent in machine learning; for example, an image can be described by a bag of visual features, a document might be considered as a bag of words, or a molecule can be handled as a bag of its different configurations. Set kernels (also called multi-instance or ensemble kernels; Gaertner 2002) defining the similarity of two bags as the average pairwise point similarities between the sets, are among the most widely applied tools to handle problems based on such BoF representations.

59389c6cc50f90cdd3add0bd	We study the problem of using iid samples from an unknown multivariate probability distribution $ p $ to estimate the mutual information of $ p $. This problem has recently received attention in two settings:(1) where $ p $ is assumed to be Gaussian and (2) where $ p $ is assumed only to lie in a large nonparametric smoothness class. Estimators proposed for the Gaussian case converge in high dimensions when the Gaussian assumption holds, but are brittle, failing dramatically when $ p $ is not Gaussian.

But as anyone who has used a machine translation system knows, we are not there yet. In this thesis, we address four areas in which we believe translation quality can be improved across a large number of language pairs.

5938a6fcc50f90cdd3add3ba	Latent variable models are an elegant framework for capturing rich probabilistic dependencies in many applications. However, current approaches typically parametrize these models using conditional probability tables, and learning relies predominantly on local search heuristics such as Expectation Maximization. Using tensor algebra, we propose an alternative parameterization of latent variable models (where the model structures are junction trees) that still allows for computation of marginals among observed variables.

5938aaa5c50f90cdd3add4c6	An autonomous variational inference algorithm for arbitrary graphical models requires the ability to optimize variational approximations over the space of model parameters as well as over the choice of tractable families used for the variational approximation. In this paper, we present a novel combination of graph partitioning algorithms with a generalized mean field (GMF) inference algorithm. This combination optimizes over disjoint clustering of variables and performs inference using those clusters.
5938ac87c50f90cdd3add54d	Many modern machine learning (ML) algorithms are iterative, converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data. This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms' convergent nature to improve performance, by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state. Specifically, we focus on bounded staleness, in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations outof-date.
5938ad6ec50f90cdd3add58f	Data loss: threats that cause data to be lost, including failures of the storage devices themselves, or an encompassing failure, such as a building fire. Recent updates may be more vulnerable to loss because they may not have propagated to fully protected storage (eg, they might reside in a volatile OS buffer, or might not have propagated to a remote site yet).

5938b77fc50f90cdd3add868	An embodiment of a method of cooperative caching for a distributed storage system begins with a step of requesting data from storage devices which hold the data. The method continues with a step of receiving any cached blocks and expected response times for providing non-cached blocks from the storage devices. The method concludes with a step of requesting a sufficient number of the non-cached blocks from one or more particular storage devices which provides an expectation of optimal performance.
5938b81ac50f90cdd3add894	As a technologist, working in the field of storage systems, and employed by a company that develops and sells a wide range of computer systems and components, I've learned that the biggest impediments to technology transfer---including better OS support for specific applications---are not technical, but economic. This paper summarizes some of these issues, and considers how best we might respond to them.
5938b8c0c50f90cdd3add8c1	An embodiment of a method of designing a storage system begins with a step of assigning decision variables to a range of candidate storage systems. Each of the decision variables identifies a single candidate storage system. The method concludes with a step of employing the decision variables in a mathematical program to determine which of the candidate storage systems meets availability and reliability criteria and incurs a near minimal projected cost.

A design for an interconnect fabric is obtained having an interconnect device layer. The layer is adjacent to either the set of source nodes or the set of terminal nodes. Flow sets that traverse the layer of interconnect devices are identified. A pair of the flow sets are merged thereby alleviating at least one port violation. The technique may be implemented programmatically by a design tool.

Prato, a project at HP Labs, is a prototype of a self-managing DBMS service provider that eases this burden by using economic incentives to guide automated DBMS setup and management. Prato offers customers private, virtual, DBMS appliances that can each be sized up to several hundred nodes, and made available on demand, in just a few minutes.

5938c3e9c50f90cdd3addbd1	BDDs (aBDDs) are obtained from ordinary BDDs by merging BDD nodes whose abstract values coincide. We discuss four types of abstract BDDs (called S-type, 0-type, 1-type and∨-type aBDDs) which have found applications in many CAD-related areas such as equivalence checking, variable ordering and model checking. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method.
5938c49bc50f90cdd3addc02	Computer programs are preprocessed to produce normalized or standard versions to remove obfuscation that might prevent the detection of embedded malware through comparison with standard malware signatures. The normalization process can provide an unpacking of compressed or encrypted malware, a reordering of the malware into a standard form, and the detection and removal of semantically identified nonfunctional code added to disguise the malware.
5938c58ac50f90cdd3addc45	In this work, we conduct a systematic study of loops in C programs. We describe static analyses capable of efficiently identifying definite iteration in C code. Our experiments show that over one third of loops in our benchmarks take this form. To cover further loops, we systematically weaken our definition of definite iteration and derive a family of loop classes that are heuristics for definite iteration. We then measure the occurrence of these classes on real-world C code and investigate which statements are used to express them.
5938c7f6c50f90cdd3addcf3	Social media messages' brevity and unconventional spelling pose a challenge to language identification. We introduce a hierarchical model that learns character and contextualized word-level representations for language identification. Our method performs well against strong base-lines, and can also reveal code-switching.
5938c81ec50f90cdd3addcfe	Language identification systems suffer when working with short texts or in domains with unconventional spelling, such as Twitter or other social media. These challenges are explored in a shared task for Language Identification in Code-Switched Data (LICS 2016). We apply a hierarchical neural model to this task, learning character and contextualized word-level representations to make word-level language predictions. This approach performs well on both the 2014 and 2016 versions of the shared task.
5938c845c50f90cdd3addd09	We show that discourse structure, as defined by Rhetorical Structure Theory and provided by an existing discourse parser, benefits text categorization. Our approach uses a recursive neural network and a newly proposed attention mechanism to compute a representation of the text that focuses on salient content, from the perspective of both RST and the task. Experiments consider variants of the approach and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.
5938c86ec50f90cdd3addd14	Just as programming is the traditional introduction to computer science, writing grammars by hand is an excellent introduction to many topics in computational linguistics. We present and justify a well-tested introductory activity in which teams of mixed background compete to write probabilistic context-free grammars of English. The exercise brings together symbolic, probabilistic, algorithmic, and experimental issues in a way that is accessible to novices and enjoyable.
5938c99cc50f90cdd3addd69	We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training instances.
5938c9e9c50f90cdd3addd7f	Probabilistic grammars are generative statistical models that are useful for compositional and sequential structures. We present a framework, reminiscent of structural risk minimization, for empirical risk minimization of the parameters of a fixed probabilistic grammar using the log-loss. We derive sample complexity bounds in this framework that apply both to the supervised setting and the unsupervised setting.
5938ca10c50f90cdd3addd8a	In this paper, we give a treatment to the problem of bilingual part-of-speech induction with parallel data. We demonstrate that naïve optimization of log-likelihood with joint MRFs suffers from a severe problem of local maxima, and suggest an alternative--using contrastive estimation for estimation of the parameters. Our experiments show that estimating the parameters this way, using overlapping features with joint MRFs performs better than previous work on the 1984 dataset.
5938cb2bc50f90cdd3adddd9	We describe a competitive question generation and answering project used in our undergraduate natural language processing courses. This semester-long project challenges teams of three or four students to use available NLP components (or develop their own) to construct systems that ask and answer questions about an arbitrary Wikipedia article. We describe how the project and competition were structured, the outcomes, and lessons learned.
5938cb52c50f90cdd3addde3	In this paper, we propose combining augmented Lagrangian optimization with the dual decomposition method to obtain a fast algorithm for approximate MAP (maximum a posteriori) inference on factor graphs. We also show how the proposed algorithm can efficiently handle problems with (possibly global) structural constraints. The experimental results reported testify for the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach.
5938cb75c50f90cdd3adddef	We present a Bayesian formulation for weakly-supervised learning of a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertagger with an HMM. We assume supervision in the form of a tag dictionary, and our prior encourages the use of crosslinguistically common category structures as well as transitions between tags that can combine locally according to CCG's combinators. Our prior is theoretically appealing since it is motivated by languageindependent, universal properties of the CCG formalism.
5938cbd1c50f90cdd3adde0c	Variational EM has become a popular technique in probabilistic NLP with hidden variables. Commonly, for computational tractability, we make strong independence assumptions, such as the mean-field assumption, in approximating posterior distributions over hidden variables. We show how a looser restriction on the approximate posterior, requiring it to be a mixture, can help inject prior knowledge to exploit soft constraints during the variational E-step.
5938d28ac50f90cdd3ade0cc	We introduce a framework for lightweight dependency syntax annotation. Our formalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies, permitting a simple notation and annotation workflow. Moreover, the formalism encourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would streamline the annotation process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this annotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare underspecified annotations.
5938d2d4c50f90cdd3ade0e8	Many modern parsers identify the head word of each constituent they find. This makes it possible to identify the word-to-word dependencies implicit in a parse. Some parsers, known as dependency parsers, even return these dependencies as their primary output. Why bother to identify dependencies? The typical reason is to model the fact that some word pairs are more likely than others to engage in a dependency relationship.
5938d36ec50f90cdd3ade128	We propose a Bayesian generative model of how demographic social factors influence lexical choice. We apply the method to a corpus of geo-tagged Twitter messages originating from mobile phones, cross-referenced against US Census demographic data. Our method discovers communities jointly defined by linguistic and demographic properties.
5938d453c50f90cdd3ade184	We present preliminary work on SOUR CREAM (System to Organize and Understand Recipes, Capacitating Relatively Exciting Applications Meanwhile). The aim of this project is to develop new techniques for semantic parsing by focusing on the domain of cooking recipes. This report details the MILK meaning representation language and CURD, a database of recipes annotated in the MILK language. We also detail preliminary efforts at semantic processing using this dataset.
5938d4d6c50f90cdd3ade1ba	Across many disciplines, interest is increasing in the use of computational text analysis in the service of social science questions. We survey the spectrum of current methods, which lie on two dimensions:(1) computational and statistical model complexity; and (2) domain assumptions. This comparative perspective suggests directions of research to better align new methods with the goals of social scientists.
5938d82fc50f90cdd3ade30c	In this paper, we describe the overall design for a speech translation system that aims to reduce the problems caused by language barriers in medical situations. As first steps to building a system according to this design, we describe a collection of a medical corpus, and some translation experiments performed on this corpus. As a result of the experiments, we find that the best of three modern translation systems is able to translate 33%-81% of the sentences in a way such that the main content is understandable.
5938da92c50f90cdd3ade3fe	This paper describes the Nara Institute of Science and Technology's system for the entrance exam pilot task of CLEF 2013 QA4MRE. The core of the system is a similar to the system for the main task of CLEF 2013 QA4MRE. We use minimum error rate training (MERT) to train the weights of the model and also propose a novel method for MERT with the addition of a threshold that defines the certainty with which we must answer questions. The system received a score of 22% c@ 1.
5938dc33c50f90cdd3ade49d	In this paper, we investigate the acoustic features that can be modified to control the perceptual age of a singing voice. Singers can sing expressively by controlling prosody and vocal timbre, but the varieties of voices that singers can produce are limited by physical constraints. Previous work has attempted to overcome this limitation through the use of statistical voice conversion. This technique makes it possible to convert singing voice characteristics of an arbitrary source singer into those of an arbitrary target singer.
5938cd22c50f90cdd3adde8a	We present a new algorithm for transforming dependency parse trees into phrase-structure parse trees. We cast the problem as structured prediction and learn a statistical model. Our algorithm is faster than traditional phrasestructure parsing and achieves 90.4% English parsing accuracy and 82.4% Chinese parsing accuracy, near to the state of the art on both benchmarks.
5938cd7ec50f90cdd3addeaf	We propose a shared task for question generation: the ranking of reading comprehension questions about Wikipedia articles generated by a base overgenerating system. This task focuses on domain-general issues in question generation and invites a variety of approaches, and also permits semi-automatic evaluation. We describe an initial system we developed for this task, and an annotation scheme used in the development and evaluation of our system.
5938cdd5c50f90cdd3addece	We present a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and semantic dependencies. It learns a representation of the entire algorithm state, using stack long short-term memories. Our greedy inference algorithm has linear time, including feature extraction. On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that jointly learn syntax and semantics.
5938cef8c50f90cdd3addf48	We consider the task of identifying and labeling the semantic arguments of a predicate that evokes a FrameNet frame. This task is challenging because there are only a few thousand fully annotated sentences for supervised training. Our approach augments an existing model with features derived from FrameNet and PropBank and with partially annotated exemplars from FrameNet. We observe a 4% absolute increase in F1 versus the original model.
5938cfdec50f90cdd3addfa6	We propose a Bayesian generative model of how demographic social factors influence lexical choice. We apply the method to a corpus of geo-tagged Twitter messages originating from mobile phones, cross-referenced against US Census demographic data. Our method discovers communities jointly defined by linguistic and demographic properties.
5938d023c50f90cdd3addfc0	We consider the task of generating transliterated word forms. To allow for a wide range of interacting features, we use a conditional random field (CRF) sequence labeling model. We then present two innovations: a training objective that optimizes toward any of a set of possible correct labels (since more than one transliteration is often possible for a particular input), and a k-best reranking stage to incorporate nonlocal features. This paper presents results on the Arabic-English transliteration task of the NEWS 2012 workshop.
5938d1c3c50f90cdd3ade07f	We explore Debatepedia, a communityauthored encyclopedia of sociopolitical debates, as evidence for inferring a lowdimensional, human-interpretable representation in the domain of issues and positions. We introduce a generative model positing latent topics and cross-cutting positions that gives special treatment to person mentions and opinion words. We evaluate the resulting representation's usefulness in attaching opinionated documents to arguments and its consistency with human judgments about positions.
5938d1fdc50f90cdd3ade096	To support empirical study of online privacy policies, as well as tools for users with privacy concerns, we consider the problem of aligning sections of a thousand policy documents, based on the issues they address. We apply an unsupervised HMM; in two new (and reusable) evaluations, we find the approach more effective than clustering and topic models.
5938d807c50f90cdd3ade2fc	本論文では, 形態素解析の問題を単語分割と品詞推定に分解し, それぞれの処理で点予測を用いる手法を提案する. 点予測とは, 分類器の素性として, 周囲の単語境界や品詞等の推定値を利用せずに, 周囲の文字列の情報のみを利用する方法である. 点予測を用いることで, 柔軟に言語資源を利用することができる. 特に分野適応において, 低い人的コストで, 高い分野適応性を実現できる. 提案手法の評価として, 言語資源が豊富な一般分野において, 既存手法である CRF と形態素 n-gram モデルと品詞 2-gram モデル (HMM) との解析精度の比較を行い, 同程度の精度を得た.
5938df9bc50f90cdd3ade5fa	Translation memories (TMs) are very useful tools for translating texts in narrow domains. We propose the use of paraphrases for searching TMs. By using paraphrases, we can retrieve sentences that have the same meaning as the input sentences even if they do not match exactly. The paraphrase pairs used in our system are obtained from parallel corpora and are used to retrieve sentences in a statistical framework.
5938e09cc50f90cdd3ade65b	The perceived age of a singing voice is the age of the singer as perceived by the listener, and is one of the notable characteristics that determines perceptions of a song. In this paper, we describe an investigation of acoustic features that have an effect on the perceived age, and a novel voice timbre control technique based on the perceived age for singing voice conversion (SVC). Singers can sing expressively by controlling prosody and voice timbre, but the varieties of voices that singers can produce are limited by physical constraints.
5938f443c50f90cdd3adee2a	The fundamental premise behind Moving Target Defense (MTD) is to create a dynamic and shifting system that is more difficult to attack than a static system because a constantly changing attack surface at least reduces the chance of an attacker finding and exploiting the weakness. However, MTD approaches are typically chosen without regard to other qualities of the system, such as performance or cost. This report explores the use of self-adaptive systems, in particular those based on the architecture of the running system.
5938f5cdc50f90cdd3adeecb	The Dagstuhl Artifacts Series (DARTS) publishes evaluated research data and artifacts in all areas of computer science. An artifact can be any kind of content related to computer science research, eg, experimental data, source code, virtual machines containing a complete setup, test suites, or tools.
593a4932c50f90cdd3aeb683	Dynamic self-assembled material systems constantly consume energy to maintain their spatiotemporal structures and functions. Programmable self-assembly translates information from individual parts to the collective whole. Combining dynamic and programmable self-assembly in a single platform opens up the possibilities to investigate both types of self-assembly simultaneously and to explore their synergy. This task is challenging because of the difficulty in finding suitable interactions that are both dissipative and programmable.
593a49f8c50f90cdd3aeb6c0	In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract endoscopy field, ingestible wireless capsule endoscopy is emerging as a novel, minimally invasive diagnostic technology for inspection of the GI tract and diagnosis of a wide range of diseases and pathologies. Since the development of this technology, medical device companies and many research groups have made substantial progress in converting passive capsule endoscopes to robotic active capsule endoscopes with most of the functionality of current active flexible endoscopes.
5938e4ddc50f90cdd3ade80b	This paper presents the results of the shared tasks from the 3rd workshop on Asian translation (WAT2016) including J↔ E, J↔ C scientific paper translation subtasks, C↔ J, K↔ J, E↔ J patent translation subtasks, I↔ E newswire subtasks and H↔ E, H↔ J mixed domain subtasks. For the WAT2016, 15 institutions participated in the shared tasks. About 500 translation results have been submitted to the automatic evaluation server, and selected submissions were manually evaluated.
5938e5f3c50f90cdd3ade87c	We present a pointwise approach to Japanese morphological analysis (MA) that ignores structure information during learning and tagging. Despite the lack of structure, it is able to outperform the current state-of-the-art structured approach for Japanese MA, and achieves accuracy similar to that of structured predictors using the same feature set. We also find that the method is both robust to out-of-domain data, and can be easily adapted through the use of a combination of partial annotation and active learning.

5938e7d1c50f90cdd3ade942	The heat transfer rates and pressure drop data available in the literature for the flow of water and power law non-Newtonian fluid flowing across staggered triangular tube bank are analyzed using capillary tube bundle approach. Correlations for predicting friction factor and heat transfer are proposed and compared with those based on parallel channel model.
5938e823c50f90cdd3ade960	Systems, methods, and devices are provided for estimating bilirubin levels. In one aspect, a method for estimating the level of bilirubin in a patient includes receiving image data for at least one image including a region of the patient's skin and a color calibration target. Color-balanced image data for the skin region is generated based on a subset of the image data corresponding to the color calibration target and the skin region. The bilirubin level in the patient is estimated based on the color-balanced image data for the skin region.
5938e957c50f90cdd3ade9d5	An electronic system includes: a vibration broadcast module configured to provide a vibration; a sensor query module, coupled to the vibration broadcast module, with a motion sensor and a sound sensor configured to detect the vibration; and an operation module, coupled to the sensor query module, configured to invoke an operation based on the vibration detected.
5938f060c50f90cdd3adeca1	Fault prediction models usually employ software metrics which were previously shown to be a strong predictor for defects, eg, SLOC. However, metrics are usually defined on a microlevel (method, class, package), and should therefore be aggregated in order to provide insights in the evolution at the macro-level (system). In addition to traditional aggregation techniques such as the mean, median, or sum, recently econometric aggregation techniques, such as the Gini, Theil, and Hoover indices have been proposed.
5938f23dc50f90cdd3aded5b	The term big data arose under the explosive increase of global data as a technology that is able to store and process big and varied volumes of data, providing both enterprises and science with deep insights over its clients/experiments. Cloud computing provides a reliable, fault-tolerant, available and scalable environment to harbour big data distributed management systems. Within the context of this paper we present an overview of both technologies and cases of success when integrating big data and cloud frameworks.
5938f29fc50f90cdd3aded82	Reuse of software entities such as components or web services raise composition issues since, most of the time, they present mismatching behavioural interfaces. Here, we particularly focus on systems for which the number of transactions is unbounded, and unknown in advance. This is typical in pervasive systems where a new client may show up at any moment to request or access a specific service. Hence,...
5938f314c50f90cdd3adedb0	Resumen. Self-adaptive software systems are those able to manage changing operating conditions dynamically and autonomously. Currently, most proposals in this field rely on an explicit representation of the components and goals of the system. This approach is suitable for closed systems, where constituent components are well known at design time. However, there are many situations in which software systems are open, and new components or services may dynamically join or leave the context of the system at any given moment.

5938fa8dc50f90cdd3adf0ad	Adaptation of complex service-based systems is one of the most challenging research problems for the Future Internet. A considerable effort has been dedicated in recent years to address this problem. However, there are still several important issues that call for concrete solutions. In this paper, we present a set of research challenges for muti-layer and mixed-initiative adaptation and monitoring that may guide the research in this area for the next 5-10 years.
5938fbc5c50f90cdd3adf124	In this paper we outline an approach to the formalization of Web Service composition using WSBPEL (formerly BPEL4WS). Complementing current specification by adding protocol information, and making use of process algebra to model both Web Service and business process dynamic behaviour, we highlight key issues regarding the analysis of Web Service compatibility in the context of a business process managing their interaction.
5938fc34c50f90cdd3adf14f	We propose a technique for the synthesis of safety controllers for switched systems using multi-scale abstractions. To this end we build on a recent notion of multi-scale discrete abstractions for incrementally stable switched systems. These abstractions are defined on a sequence of embedded lattices approximating the state-space, the finer ones being used only in a restricted area where fast switching is needed. This makes it possible to deal with fast switching while keeping the number of states in the abstraction at a reasonable level.
5938fd64c50f90cdd3adf1c5	This paper briefly describes the design of a dynamic adaptation management framework which exploits the concepts provided by Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), in particular Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). The framework uses reflection and adaptation techniques in order to support COTS composition and evolution by tackling issues related to signature and protocol interoperability. This provides a basic infrastructure for a non-intrusive, semi-automatic approach for syntactical and behavioural adaptation.
5938fea5c50f90cdd3adf247	Physical cash is vulnerable to rising threats, such as large-scale, government-mandated forgeries, that digital cash may protect against more effectively. We study mechanisms to combine physical cash with digital cash to remove their respective shortcomings and obtain their combined advantages. We discuss initial mechanisms and examine their cost and benefit trade-offs.
5938fec6c50f90cdd3adf256	This paper investigate security of graphical authentication tokens against educated guess attacks. Results of two user studies indicate that, if we use original photos as authentication tokens, the authentication tokens are vulnerable to educated guess attacks. The results also demonstrate that we can mitigate the vulnerability using distorted pictures.
59390048c50f90cdd3adf2ea	In this article, we first introduce the methodology for our recent work on password-composition policies [5, 6] and password meters [8], and define the metrics we used to measure the security and usability of passwords. We then highlight key results from these studies, paying particular attention to the lessons they hold for guiding real-world password creation.
5939013bc50f90cdd3adf34b	This paper discusses and evaluates two novel multisensory user authentication mechanisms aimed at preventing observation attacks. These mechanisms improve the usability of our previous work by reducing authentication times, and are more suitable for portable and mobile devices.
5939018bc50f90cdd3adf368	Abstract—We take the position that audit mechanisms are essential for privacy protection in healthcare environments. Although audits are used in practice and commercial tools that provide assistance for audits are emerging, we currently lack rigorous models and definitions of properties that can guide the design of appropriate audit mechanisms. We report on our recent result that presents a principled learning-theoretic approach to audits with the goal of stimulating discussion and additional research on this problem.
593902f9c50f90cdd3adf3f9	In this paper, we build on existing literature and on a dialog with several decision-making partners (eg, CISOs) to propose a simple methodology to quantitatively assess the value of security. We use this methodology to provide quantitative data gathered from three case studies of real organizations. The vastly different results we obtain across the three organizations considered emphasize the dependence between the security investments and the nature of the organization implementing them.
593904e3c50f90cdd3adf4bb	Although many users create predictable passwords, the extent to which users realize these passwords are predictable is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between users' perceptions of the strength of specific passwords and their actual strength. In this 165-participant online study, we ask participants to rate the comparative security of carefully juxtaposed pairs of passwords, as well as the security and memorability of both existing passwords and common password-creation strategies.
5939055cc50f90cdd3adf4e9	This paper presents a formal, quantitative evaluation of the impact of bounded-rational security decision-making subject to limited information and externalities. We investigate a mixed economy of an individual rational expert and several naıve near-sighted agents. We further model three canonical types of negative externalities (weakest-link, best shot and total effort), and study the impact of two information regimes on the threat level agents are facing.
5939069bc50f90cdd3adf562	Striping is a resource aggregation technique that can improve application performance for a multihomed host by utilizing multiple interfaces. In this position paper, we argue in favor of decoupling striping primitives from all of the traditional layers of the networking protocol stack, and instead resurrecting the session layer for striping. Session layer striping indeed allows applications to take advantage of multihoming, while avoiding most of the deployability issues traditionally linked with modiflying application layer code.
59390e91c50f90cdd3adf88c	The M/G/s queueing system is the oldest and most classical example of multiserver systems. Such multiserver systems are commonplace in a wide range of applications, ranging from call centers to manufacturing systems to computer systems, because they are cost-effective and their serving capacity can be easily scaled up or down.
59390ed7c50f90cdd3adf8a7	We consider the M/G/k/staggered-setup, where idle servers are turned off to save cost, necessitating a setup time for turning a server back on; however, at most one server may be in setup mode at any time. We show that, for exponentially distributed setup times, the response time of an M/G/k/staggered-setup approximately decomposes into the sum of the response time for an M/G/k and the setup time, where the approximation is nearly exact. This generalizes a prior decomposition result for an M/M/k/staggered-setup.
593910d4c50f90cdd3adf96c	Memory schedulers in multicore systems should carefully schedule memory requests from different threads to ensure high system performance and fair, fast progress of each thread. No existing memory scheduler provides both the highest system performance and highest fairness. Thread Cluster Memory scheduling is a new algorithm that achieves the best of both worlds by differentiating latency-sensitive threads from bandwidth-sensitive ones and employing different scheduling policies for each.

5939115ac50f90cdd3adf9a5	Dynamic capacity provisioning is a well studied approach to handling gradual changes in data center load. However, abrupt spikes in load are still problematic in that the work in the system rises very quickly during the setup time needed to turn on additional capacity. Performance can be severely affected even if it takes only 5 seconds to bring additional capacity online. In this paper, we propose SOFTScale, an approach to handling load spikes in multi-tier data centers without having to over-provision resources.
59391256c50f90cdd3adfa0c	Everyone loves a large caching tier in their multitier cloud-based web service because it both alleviates database load and provides lower request latencies. Even when load drops severely, administrators are reluctant to scale down their caching tier. This paper makes the case that (i) scaling down the caching tier is viable with respect to performance, and (ii) the savings are potentially huge; eg, a 4x drop in load can result in 90% savings in the caching tier size.
59391358c50f90cdd3adfa72	We compare the overall mean response time (aka sojourn time) of the processor sharing (PS) and feedback (FB) queues under an M/GI/1 system. We show that FB outperforms PS under service distributions having decreasing failure rates; whereas PS outperforms FB under service distributions having increasing failure rates.
5939162ec50f90cdd3adfb8c	Server farms today often over-provision resources to handle peak demand, resulting in an excessive waste of power. Ideally, server farm capacity should be dynamically adjusted based on the incoming demand. However, the unpredictable and time-varying nature of customer demands makes it very difficult to efficiently scale capacity in server farms. The problem is further exacerbated by the large setup time needed to increase capacity, which can adversely impact response times as well as utilize additional power.
593916c9c50f90cdd3adfbcd	Approximating general distributions by phase-type (PH) distributions is a popular technique in queueing analysis, since the Markovian property of PH distributions often allows analytical tractability. This paper proposes an algorithm for mapping a general distribution G to a PH distribution where the goal is to find a PH distribution which matches the first three moments of G. Since efficiency of the algorithm is of primary importance, we first define a particular subset of the PH distributions, which we refer to as EC distributions.
593918c4c50f90cdd3adfc92	It is common to evaluate scheduling policies based on their mean response times. Another important, but sometimes opposing, performance metric is a scheduling policy's fairness. For example, a policy that biases towards small job sizes so as to minimize mean response time may end up being unfair to large job sizes. In this paper we define three types of unfairness and demonstrate large classes of scheduling policies that fall into each type. We end with a discussion on which jobs are the ones being treated unfairly.
593919d2c50f90cdd3adfcf8	Workload generators may be classified as based on a closed system model, where new job arrivals are only triggered by job completions (followed by think time), or an open system model, where new jobs arrive independently of job completions. In general, system designers pay little attention to whether a workload generator is closed or open.

59391bdbc50f90cdd3adfdca	We now discuss how accumulated platform information (Section 2) can benefit a local user. Unfortunately, these measurements cannot be used to directly provide information to local software; ie, it does not make sense for higher-privileged software to use these measurements to convey information to less-privileged software, since the less-privileged software must already trust the higher-privileged software.
59391c05c50f90cdd3adfddd	Trust in any system needs a foundation or a root of trust. Here, we discuss the roots of trust that have been proposed or deployed. Typically, the root of trust is based on the secrecy of a private key that is embedded in hardware; the corresponding public key is certified by the hardware's manufacturer. As we discuss, some systems further rely on a piece of code that must execute in the early boot process for their root of trust. We also discuss schemes where the root of trust is established by the properties of the physical hardware itself.
59391c8bc50f90cdd3adfe13	When it comes to bootstrapping trust in computers, there appear to be significant limitations on the types of guarantees that can be offered against software and hardware attacks. We summarize these limitations below to alert practitioners to the dangers and to inspire more research in these areas.
59391cb6c50f90cdd3adfe22	The Trusted Computing Group is actually a successor organization (formed in 2003) to the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA). Balacheff et al. document the design of the v1. 1b13 TPM as it emerged from the TCPA era [17]. Note that the v1. 1b TPM does not include any support for dynamic root of trust (Section 5.2), and indeed, the only platform change required to support v1. 1b was BIOS support for the Core Root of Trust for Measurement (CRTM).
59391d1dc50f90cdd3adfe4a	Section 2 described mechanisms for accumulating measurements of software state. In this section, we treat the issue of conveying these measurement chains to an external entity in an authentic manner. We refer to this process as attestation, though some works use the phrase outbound authentication. We also discuss privacy concerns and mitigation strategies that arise when sharing this information with third parties.
59391d3cc50f90cdd3adfe57	Here we introduce a variety of open-source software projects that are highly relevant to bootstrapping trust. At the time of this writing many interesting software packages are available, including a full Linux distribution and several LiveCDs that facilitate experimentation without modifying anything on one's hard drive. These software packages are an excellent starting place for gaining a deeper understanding of the capabilities of existing hardware and software to bootstrap trust.
59391d64c50f90cdd3adfe66	Knowing what code is executing on a platform does not necessarily translate into knowing whether that code can be trusted. In this section, we elaborate on this problem (5.1) and then review solutions that fall into two broad categories: solutions that provide only the identity of security-relevant code (5.2), and those that convey higher-level information (5.3).
59391e40c50f90cdd3adfeb9	The Workshop on Language Support for Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETShop'13) aims at bringing together researchers from the areas of security, programming languages, compiler construction, and program verification to exchange ideas and research results to improve the practicality of state of the art cryptographic privacy-enhancing technologies.
59391ecec50f90cdd3adfef2	An access system is described herein which allows an application module to access a user-owned resource based on an indication of a user's intent to interact with the user-owned resource. For example, the application module can provide an application user interface which embeds a gadget associated with a particular user-owned resource. The access system can interpret the user's interaction with the gadget as conferring implicit permission to the application module to access the user-owned resource associated with the gadget.
59391ef0c50f90cdd3adff00	Described is a technology by which the identity of a person (eg, a customer in a commercial transaction) is determinable without active identification effort, via biometric data is obtained without action by the person. Machine processing of the biometric data over a set of possible persons, determined from secondary proximity sensing, is used to determine or assist in determining the identity of the person.
59391fabc50f90cdd3adff4d	High-performance cryptographic code often relies on complex hand-tuned assembly language that is customized for individual hardware platforms. Such code is difficult to understand or analyze. We introduce a new programming language and tool called Vale that supports flexible, automated verification of high-performance assembly code. The Vale tool transforms annotated assembly language into an abstract syntax tree (AST), while also generating proofs about the AST that are verified via an SMT solver.

59392199c50f90cdd3ae0012	Creating trustworthy systems requires advances on many fronts, including programming languages, operating systems, network protocols, and definitions of security. More fundamentally, both computers and users must be able to make accurate, informed trust decisions. After all, even if software improves, users must be able to determine which systems employ the new, improved software. In particular, users must be able to judge whether a system (local or remote) should be trusted before handing over sensitive data.
5939220ec50f90cdd3ae0040	Physical cash is vulnerable to rising threats, such as large-scale, government-mandated forgeries, that digital cash may protect against more effectively. We study mechanisms to combine physical cash with digital cash to remove their respective shortcomings and obtain their combined advantages. We discuss initial mechanisms and examine their cost and benefit trade-offs.
59392442c50f90cdd3ae011e	The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) is an organization that promotes open standards to help strengthen computing platforms against software-based attacks [1]. The TCG issued a specification for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)[4], which is a dedicated security chip designed to enhance software security. The background on the TPM necessary to understand sealed storage is presented below, along with an example of how sealed storage might be used by an application.
5939246fc50f90cdd3ae0131	We envision a future where Web, mobile, and desktop applications are delivered as isolated, complete software stacks to a minimal, secure client host. This shift imbues app vendors with full autonomy to maintain their apps' integrity. Achieving this goal requires shifting complex behavior out of the client platform and into the vendors' isolated apps. We ported rich, interactive POSIX apps, such as Gimp and Inkscape, to a spartan host platform. We describe this effort in sufficient detail to support reproducibility.
59392649c50f90cdd3ae01f2	The area of proof-based verified computation (outsourced computation built atop probabilistically checkable proofs and cryptographic machinery) has lately seen renewed interest. Although recent work has made great strides in reducing the overhead of naive applications of the theory, these schemes still cannot be considered practical. A core issue is that the work for the server is immense, in general; it is practical only for hand-compiled computations that can be expressed in special forms. This paper addresses that problem.
593927c4c50f90cdd3ae0282	Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (eg, to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (eg, to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data).
59392910c50f90cdd3ae0303	We introduce and formalize the notion of Verifiable Computation, which enables a computationally weak client to “outsource” the computation of a function F on various dynamically-chosen inputs x1,..., xk to one or more workers. The workers return the result of the function evaluation, eg, yi= F (xi), as well as a proof that the computation of F was carried out correctly on the given value xi. The primary constraint is that the verification of the proof should require substantially less computational effort than computing F (xi) from scratch.
59392ce9c50f90cdd3ae0486	A provably secure protocol for remote authentication is presented. Only public information is stored at the verifying host that makes our scheme resistant to server compromise. We use one time signatures coupled with offline transcripts for synchronization. Due to sole usage of fast cryptographic hash functions, our method is appropriate for low cost user authentication. Our construction improves over the previously proposed technique of Mitchell to overcome its problem of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
5939316bc50f90cdd3ae0796	Cloud services provide a powerful resource to which weak clients may outsource their computation. While tremendously useful, they come with their own security challenges. One of the fundamental issues in cloud computation is: how does a client efficiently verify the correctness of computation performed on an untrusted server? Furthermore, how can the client be assured that the server learns nothing about its private inputs? In recent years, a number of proposals have been made for constructing verifiable computation protocols.
5939330bc50f90cdd3ae0836	We consider the question of designing concurrently self-composable protocols in the plain model. We first focus on the minimal setting where there is a party P 1 which might interact with several other parties in any unbounded (polynomial) number of concurrent sessions. P 1 holds a single input x which it uses in all the concurrent sessions. An analogy is a server interacting with various clients at the same time. In this “single input” setting, we show that many (or even most) functionalities can be securely realized in the plain model.
593933b8c50f90cdd3ae087d	In this work, we present the first definitions and constructions for functional encryption supporting randomized functionalities. The setting of randomized functionalities require us to revisit functional encryption definitions by, for the first time, explicitly adding security requirements for dishonest encryptors, to ensure that they cannot improperly tamper with the randomness that will be used for computing outputs. Our constructions are built using indistinguishability obfuscation.

59393aeec50f90cdd3ae0b59	This paper introduces the open-source Graphite distributed parallel multicore simulator infrastructure. Graphite is designed from the ground up for exploration of future multicore processors containing dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of cores. It provides high performance for fast design space exploration and software development for future processors. Several techniques are used to achieve this performance including: direct execution, multi-machine distribution, analytical modeling, and lax synchronization.

59473addc50f90cdd3b437f2	The main purpose of the KeY system is to ensure program correctness wrt a formal specification on the level of source code. However, a flawed (?) compiler may invalidate correctness properties that have been formally verified for the program's sourcecode. Hence, we additionally need to guarantee the correctness of the compilation result wrt its source code.
594772ddc50f90cdd3b44d6c	In existing systems, the off-chip memory interface allows the memory controller to perform only read or write operations. Therefore, to perform any operation, the processor must first read the source data and then write the result back to memory after performing the operation. This approach consumes high latency, bandwidth, and energy for operations that work on a large amount of data. Several works have proposed techniques to process data near memory by adding a small amount of compute logic closer to the main memory chips.

5947fc92c50f90cdd3b48c11	While exoskeleton assistance strategies have been explored for decades, devices that can reduce the metabolic cost of walking are relatively new [1]. Many of the current strategies use autonomous hardware and controllers specific to the hardware rather than the subject. Our lab uses an emulator system with lightweight end-effectors [2] and off-board motors and control hardware [3]. With this hardware, we can test a wide variety of control strategies over the course of a single experiment and can customize the assistance to the user.
59485727c50f90cdd3b4da8e	Abstract—As video cameras proliferate in the Internet of Things, the ability to scalably capture and search that data becomes important. Scalability can be achieved by performing video analytics on cloudlets at the edge of the Internet, and only shipping extracted index information and meta-data to the cloud. This paper describes a technique called just-in-time indexing that extends such an architecture to support interactive content-based retrospective search of cloudlet data for predicates that were not part of the original indexing strategy.

593943b4c50f90cdd3ae0ecf	A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.
593945b4c50f90cdd3ae0f97	Here, a separation theorem about Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA), a generalization of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is proven. According to the theorem, ISA estimation can be executed in two steps under certain conditions. In the first step, 1-dimensional ICA estimation is executed. In the second step, optimal permutation of the ICA elements is searched for. We shall show that elliptically symmetric sources, among others, satisfy the conditions of the theorem.
59394833c50f90cdd3ae109b	We studied user behaviors when the cursor is directed by a head in a simple control task. We used an intelligent writing tool called Dasher. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were applied to separate behavioral patterns. We found that similar interpretations can be given to the hidden states upon learning. It is argued that the recognition of such general application specific behavioral patterns should be of help for adaptive human-computer interfaces.
59394915c50f90cdd3ae10f1	In this paper, we present two new communication-efficient methods for distributed minimization of an average of functions. The first algorithm is an inexact variant of the DANE algorithm that allows any local algorithm to return an approximate solution to a local subproblem. We show that such a strategy does not affect the theoretical guarantees of DANE significantly. In fact, our approach can be viewed as a robustification strategy since the method is substantially better behaved than DANE on data partition arising in practice.
59394a32c50f90cdd3ae115f	This paper studies active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes.
59394b01c50f90cdd3ae11b6	Structured sparse coding and the related structured dictionary learning problems are novel research areas in machine learning. In this paper we present a new application of structured dictionary learning for collaborative filtering based recommender systems. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the presented method outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors and has several advantages over approaches that do not put structured constraints on the dictionary elements.
59394bedc50f90cdd3ae1216	Identification of mixed independent subspaces is thought to suffer from combinatorial explosion of two kinds: the minimization of mutual information between the estimated subspaces and the search for the optimal number and dimensions of the subspaces. Here we show that independent autoregressive process analysis, under certain conditions, can avoid this problem using a two-phase estimation process. We illustrate the solution by computer demonstration.
59394c5cc50f90cdd3ae1245	In this paper we propose new nonparametric estimators for a family of conditional mutual information and divergences. Our estimators are easy to compute; they only use simple k nearest neighbor based statistics. We prove that the proposed conditional information and divergence estimators are consistent under certain conditions, and demonstrate their consistency and applicability by numerical experiments on simulated and on real data as well.
59394d15c50f90cdd3ae128c	Anticipating future events is a crucial function of the central nervous system and can be modelled by Kalman filter-like mechanisms, which are optimal for predicting linear dynamical systems. Connectionist representation of such mechanisms with Hebbian learning rules has not yet been derived. We show that the recursive prediction error method offers a solution that can be mapped onto the entorhinal–hippocampal loop in a biologically plausible way. Model predictions are provided.
59394eeec50f90cdd3ae133f	An important task in exploring and analyzing real-world data sets is to detect unusual and interesting phenomena. In this paper, we study the group anomaly detection problem. Unlike traditional anomaly detection research that focuses on data points, our goal is to discover anomalous aggregated behaviors of groups of points. For this purpose, we propose the Flexible Genre Model (FGM). FGM is designed to characterize data groups at both the point level and the group level so as to detect various types of group anomalies.
59394f5cc50f90cdd3ae136b	We treat the problem of searching for hidden multi-dimensional independent auto-regressive processes. First, we transform the problem to Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA). Our main contribution concerns ISA. We show that under certain conditions, ISA is equivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem. For the solution of this optimization we apply the cross-entropy method. Numerical simulations indicate that the cross-entropy method can provide considerable improvements over other state-of-the-art methods.
59394fb3c50f90cdd3ae1390	A novel algorithm called independent subspace analysis (ISA) is introduced to estimate independent subspaces. The algorithm solves the ISA problem by estimating multi-dimensional differential entropies. Two variants are examined, both of them utilize distances between the k-nearest neighbors of the sample points. Numerical simulations demonstrate the usefulness of the algorithms.

59497bedc50f90cdd3b573a7	Smart Cyber--Physical Systems (sCPS) are modern CPS systems that are engineered to seamlessly integrate a large number of computation and physical components; they need to control entities in their environment in a smart and collective way to achieve a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. At the same time, these systems are supposed to be safe and secure, deal with environment dynamicity and uncertainty, cope with external threats, and optimize their behavior to achieve the best possible outcome.
594a5327c50f90cdd3b5f39e	Cloud computing has emerged as a dominant computing platform for the foreseeable future, resulting in an ongoing disruption to the way we build and deploy software. This disruption offers a rare opportunity to integrate new approaches to computer security. The aggregating effect of cloud computing and the role of cloud providers as trust anchors can significantly benefit computing security.
594b34bfc50f90cdd3b69e76	We study the problem of interactive learning of a classifier from\\emph {noisy} labeling and pairwise comparison oracles with near-optimal label complexity. The comparison oracle answers which instance in the given two instances is more likely to be positive, and learning from both oracles has multiple applications ranging from the handwriting recognition to the recommendation system. However, much remains unknown concerning to what extent the comparison oracle helps to improve the label complexity.
594b747fc50f90cdd3b6c282	The prevalence of impaction of the mandibular second molar (M2) is low. However, the common complications are harmful to the masticatory function, the dentition integrity as well as the adjacent tooth. We presented a case of the deeply impacted M2 that underwent first surgical explosion and then orthodontic extrusion and eventually erupted into excellent position. This case illustrated the importance of combined orthodontic-surgical approach to establish the optimal treatment plan.
59395caec50f90cdd3ae18b3	We propose a family of statistical models for social network evolution over time, which represents an extension of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). Many of the methods for ERGMs are readily adapted for these models, including MCMC maximum likelihood estimation algorithms. We discuss models of this type and give examples, as well as a demonstration of their use for hypothesis testing and classification.
59395f20c50f90cdd3ae19a9	We propose a new algorithm for approximate MAP inference on factor graphs, by combining augmented Lagrangian optimization with the dual decomposition method. Each slave subproblem is given a quadratic penalty, which pushes toward faster consensus than in previous subgradient approaches. Our algorithm is provably convergent, parallelizable, and suitable for fine decompositions of the graph. We show how it can efficiently handle problems with (possibly global) structural constraints via simple sort operations.
59395fc7c50f90cdd3ae19ec	To understand the alterations of Rb tumor suppressor gene and the relationship between defects in the Rb and p53 pathways in human esophageal carcinogenesis, we examined the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Rb gene and immunohistochemical staining of pRb protein in 56 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma specimens and related the results to the p53 gene alterations. Using four introgenic polymorphic markers as probes, we observed LOH of the Rb gene in 30 of the 55 informative tumor samples.
59396138c50f90cdd3ae1a7c	Motivation: Many complex disease syndromes such as asthma consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes, raising a new technical challenge in identifying genetic variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. Although a causal genetic variation may influence a group of highly correlated traits jointly, most of the previous association analyses considered each phenotype separately, or combined results from a set of single-phenotype analyses.
59396500c50f90cdd3ae1bfd	We report on the successful application of feature selection methods to a classification problem in molecular biology involving only 72 data points in a 7130 dimensional space. Our approach is a hybrid of filter and wrapper approaches to feature selection. We make use of a sequence of simple filters, culminating in Koller and Sahami's (1996) Markov Blanket filter, to decide on particular feature subsets for each subset cardinality. We compare between the resulting subset cardinalities using cross validation.
59395678c50f90cdd3ae1642	We present a series of prototype devices that use real-time input to fabricate physical form: Interactive Fabrication. Our work maps out the problem space of real-time control for digital fabrication devices, and examines where alternative interfaces for digital fabrication are relevant. We conclude by reflecting upon the potential of interactive fabrication and outline a number of considerations for future research in this area.
5939576fc50f90cdd3ae169f	Motivation: As many complex disease and expression phenotypes are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular networks underlying gene regulation resulted from interdependent genome variations, association mapping of causal QTLs or expression quantitative trait loci must consider both additive and epistatic effects of multiple candidate genotypes. This problem poses a significant challenge to contemporary genome-wide-association (GWA) mapping technologies because of its computational complexity.
594b7638c50f90cdd3b6c381	In this paper, the low cycle fatigue (LCF) behavior of Q345b steel was experimentally investigated in fully reversed cyclic axial configurations at room temperature. The strain range of 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.7% at constant strain rate of 0.005 s-1 was adopted. Cyclic stress-strain curve and strain life relationship were analyzed according to the Ramberg-Osgood relationship and Coffin-Manson relationship respectively. Suitable parameters were obtained showing good agreements with the experimental fatigue data.
594b9befc50f90cdd3b6d8f0	In order to obtain structural dynamic response, a new step-by-step integration method was presented. Thismethod was introduced by quadratic Lagrangian interpolation of the nodal displacements within local time domain. Single parameters θ was varied to obtain good stability and accuracy. This method is characterized with good stability, quadric precision, self-starting and simple numerical format. Compared with the methods of Newmark, Wilson, and precise integration at different θ, this method is more accurate and reliable.

Resulting performance is measured and, in response, the operating conditions are maintained or changed in order to optimize performance. By repeatedly examining the performance of the computer system under different conditions and making adjustments to the system in response, optimal performance can be maintained despite changes in workload.

5939697cc50f90cdd3ae1dc5	A method for enforcing system performance guarantees. The method includes receiving one or more requests for access to a target system, determining at least one performance related function to apply to the one or more requests, and forwarding the one or more requests to the target system in accordance with the at least one performance related function. The at least one performance related function may be determined based on at least one previously input specification and type of the target system.
59396a37c50f90cdd3ae1e0f	Data storage devices of an enterprise system are tested to determine whether the enterprise system is optimally configured. Each data storage device is tested to determine whether it can satisfy a performance requirement for an assigned group of n workloads. A group of n inequalities are generated, and only up to n of the inequalities may be evaluated to determine whether the device satisfies the performance requirement for the assigned group of workloads. The inequalities are based on a phased, correlated model of I/O activity.
59396b9bc50f90cdd3ae1e97	External-memory versioned dictionaries are fundamental to file systems, databases and many other algorithms. The ubiquitous data structure is the copy-onwrite (CoW) B-tree. Unfortunately, it doesn't inherit the B-tree's optimality properties; it has poor space utilization, cannot offer fast updates, and relies on random IO to scale. We describe the 'stratified B-tree', which is the first versioned dictionary offering fast updates and an optimal tradeoff between space, query and update costs.
59396bf4c50f90cdd3ae1eb9	Processors are getting faster quickly, and messagepassing interconnects for multicomputers are doing the same, thanks to developments in Gb/s links and lowlatency switching fabrics. But published papers about state-of-the art multicomputers continue to discuss application-to-application message times that are typically measured in hundreds of microseconds. It seems that moving bits back and forth between processors and interconnects continues to be a performance bottleneck.
59396cb7c50f90cdd3ae1f0a	Understanding the I/O system behavior of computer systems is a necessary prelude to improving their I/O performance. For example, an understanding of the sizes of working sets, and how they change with time, can provide insights into the value of caching data at various levels of the complete system, from disk drives up to and including host main memories. A previous study of ours [Ruemmler93] was largely concerned with dynamic access characteristics and write traffic of three HP-UX systems over a two-month period.
59396d9dc50f90cdd3ae1f67	Careful simulation-based evaluation plays an important role in the design of file and disk systems. We describe here a particular approach to such evaluations that combines techniques in workload synthesis, file system modeling, and detailed disk behavior modeling. Together, these make feasible the detailed simulation of I/O hardware and file system software. In particular, using the techniques described here is likely to make comparative file system studies more accurate.

59579b4ec50f90cdd3baeac4	This work evaluates the applicability of currently available research tools to the problem of cross lingual QA. We establish a task baseline by combining a cross lingual IR system with a monolingual QA system in a very short amount of time. A higher precision strategy involves applying the monolingual QA system to an automatically translated question, assumed to be correct. A higher coverage strategy consists of a term weighted proximity measure with varied query expansion, tuned for each individual question type.

Each agent is based on a sophisticated model of cognition, ie, Soar. Using Radar-Soar we demonstrate how insight into organimtional (and so social) behavior can be gained using computational models that take a mew-approach to organizations..

ATT-CMUnited-2000 builds upon these successful implementations, but also makes makes many improvements. This paper gives an overview of the CMUnited-99 software and outlines our planned changes for ATT-CMUnited-2000.
5939ada6c50f90cdd3ae338f	Planning means constructing a course of actions to achieve a speci ed set of goals when starting from an initial situation. For example, determining a sequence of actions (a plan) for transporting goods from an initial location to some destination is a typical planning problem in the transportation domain. Many planning problems are of practical interest. The classical generative planning process consists mainly of a search through the space of possible operators to solve a given problem. For most practical problems this search is intractable.

The system, designed for deployment in robot architectures, leverages a knowledge base framework for common-sense reasoning through the integration with the symbolic and sub-symbolic structures of a cognitive architecture. Methodological and functional aspects are illustrated, together with an overview of the results obtained in a synthetic simulation experiment.
59580decc50f90cdd3bb1d2e	During collaborative learning, computer-supported or otherwise, students balance task-oriented goals with the interpersonal goals of relationship-building; these goals may conflict, negatively impacting learning. In peer tutoring, for instance, tutors may avoid providing feedback to their partners to avoid the face-threat to their tutee. In this paper, we explore how the interpersonal closeness between tutor and tutee impacts tutors' use of indirectness with feedback and instructions, and the impact those moves have on tutees' problem-solving.
59581aebc50f90cdd3bb2225	Abstract—In this correspondence, our goal is to develop a visual tracking algorithm that is able to track moving objects in the presence of illumination variations in the scene, and that is robust to occlusions. We treat the illumination and motion (xy translation and scale) parameters as the unknown “state” sequence. The observation is the entire image and the observation model allows for occasional occlusions (modeled as outliers). The nonlinearity and multimodality of the observation model necessitates the use of a particle filter (PF).
593970aac50f90cdd3ae2096	Processors are rapidly getting faster, and message-passing multicomputer interconnections are doing the same, thanks to recent developments in Gb/s links and lowlatency packet switches. But the cost of passing messages between applications also includes the overhead of crossing interfaces between the operating system (OS), a device driver, and the hardware, which can be orders of magnitude more than the cost of moving a message's bits across the wires.
5939726ac50f90cdd3ae214b	Resource usage in computer systems is often bursty: periods of high utilization alternate with periods when there is little external load. If work can be delayed from the busy periods to the lessbusy ones, resource contention during the busy periods can be reduced, and perceived system performance can be improved. The low-utilization periods can also be exploited for other purposes—for example, eagerly performing work that might be needed in the future, or shutting down parts of a system to conserve power, reduce wear, or lower thermal load.
593972b3c50f90cdd3ae216a	Modern high-end disk arrays often have several gigabytes of cache RAM. Unfortunately, most array caches use management policies which duplicate the same data blocks at both the client and array levels of the cache hierarchy: they are inclusive. Thus, the aggregate cache behaves as if it was only as big as the larger of the client and array caches, instead of as large as the sum of the two. Inclusiveness is wasteful: cache RAM is expensive.
593975f0c50f90cdd3ae22ab	During the last decades, embedded systems have become increasingly important in highly safety-critical areas such as power plants, medical equipment, cars, and aeroplanes. The automotive and avionics domains are prominent examples of classical engineering disciplines where conflicts between costs, short product cycles and legal requirements concerning dependability, robustness, security, carbon footprint and spatial demands have become a pressing problem.
5939765dc50f90cdd3ae22d8	A general criterion for the undecidabily of sub-classical firstorder logics and important fragments thereof is established. It is applied, among others, to Urquart's (original version of) C and the closely related logic C∗. In addition, hypersequent systems for (first-order) C and C∗ are introduced and shown to enjoy cut-elimination.
59397744c50f90cdd3ae2335	We define a hypersequent calculus for Gödel logic enhanced with (fuzzy) quantifiers over propositional variables. We prove soundness, completeness and cut-elimination for this calculus and provide a detailed investigation of the so-called Takeuti-Titani rule which expresses density of the ordering of truth values. Since this rule is critical from the point of view of proof search we characterize a fragment of the logic for which it can be eliminated.
5942b359c50f90cdd3b1f54d	Fifty six million, six hundred eighty seven thousand, and forty. A big number, to be sure. This is the number of possible semantic analyses for an average sized sentence in the Mikrokosmos Machine Translation project. Complex sentences have gone past the trillions. If every combination could be accurately judged in one thousandth of a second, it would still take almost a day to analyze the average sentence. And you can forget about the hard ones. And yet, understanding natural language sentences is intuitively not an exponential a air.
59433f7fc50f90cdd3b24fec	Abstract—As video cameras proliferate in the Internet of Things, the ability to scalably capture and search that data becomes important. Scalability can be achieved by performing video analytics on cloudlets at the edge of the Internet, and only shipping extracted index information and meta-data to the cloud. This paper describes a technique called just-in-time indexing that extends such an architecture to support interactive content-based retrospective search of cloudlet data for predicates that were not part of the original indexing strategy.

59590c16c50f90cdd3bb8fd3	This artifact is intended to demonstrate the module system of the Wyvern programming language and consists of a Linux virtual machine with a snapshot of the Wyvern programming language's codebase. The Wyvern codebase contains a test suite that corresponds to the code examples in the paper accompanying the artifact. In addition, the artifact contains a document describing how to compile and run Wyvern programs.
59590c5ac50f90cdd3bb8ff4	Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a new programming paradigm whose goal is to more cleanly modularize crosscutting concerns such as logging, synchronization, and event notification which would otherwise be scattered throughout the system and tangled with functional code. However, while AOP languages provide promising ways to separate crosscutting concerns, they can also break conventional encapsulation mechanisms, making it difficult to reason about code without the aid of external tools.
59397c0bc50f90cdd3ae251d	A propositional problem is a problem whose instances are defined by Boolean formulas. Using quantifier free logical reductions, we give a sufficient condition under which a large class of propositional problems becomes exponentially harder than their ordinary encodings. This result extends former upgrading results which hold only for representation by Boolean circuits. It follows that all succinct circuit problems proved complete by Papadimitriou (1994) remain complete under representation by Boolean formulas.
59397e35c50f90cdd3ae25f6	The parameterized verification of concurrent algorithms and protocols has been addressed by a variety of recent methods. Experience shows that there is a trade-off between techniques which are widely applicable but depend on nontrivial human guidance, and fully automated approaches which are tailored for narrow classes of applications. In this spectrum, we propose a new framework based on environment abstraction which exhibits a large degree of automation and can be easily adjusted to different fields of application.
59397ee0c50f90cdd3ae2627	We investigate interpolation properties of many-valued propositional logics related to continuous t-norms. In case of failure of interpolation, we characterize the minimal interpolating extensions of the languages. For finite-valued logics, we count the number of interpolating extensions by Fibonacci sequences.
59397f96c50f90cdd3ae265a	The research on systems of logic programming with modules has followed two mainstreams, programming-in-the-large, where compositional operators are provided for combining separate and independent modules, and programming-in-the-small, which aims at enhancing logic programming with new logical connectives.
5939801cc50f90cdd3ae267f	For processing compiled code, model checkers require accurate model extraction from binaries. We present our fully configurable binary analysis platform Jakstab, which resolves indirect branches by multiple rounds of disassembly interleaved with dataflow analysis. We demonstrate that this iterative disassembling strategy achieves better results than the state-of-the-art tool IDA Pro.
59592313c50f90cdd3bb9b5b	Extracting topographic features from elevation maps has traditionally been studied in two research areas: in robotics, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) route planning and self-localization,[1 11 and in cartography, the automation of the map making process [6, 10, 141. Recently, Seemuller [141 presented a method for producing drainage networks from terrain elevation data. In his method, he determined drainage points by finding grids located at a local minimum in elevation for the horizontal or vertical direction in a 3 x 3 neighborhood.
59596e7fc50f90cdd3bbb861	In the era of social media, a large number of user-generated videos are uploaded to the Internet every day, capturing events all over the world. Reconstructing the event truth based on information mined from these videos has been an emerging challenging task. Temporal alignment of videos “in the wild” which capture different moments at different positions with different perspectives is the critical step. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to synchronize videos. Our system utilizes clustered audio-signatures to align video pairs.
59598868c50f90cdd3bbc24b	Research has generated deep insights into computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), but the cycle of impact on practice is relatively lengthy and slow. In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ. Developing learning analytics to support CSCL thus offers the opportunity to make our research actionable in an immediate way by using data collected on collaborative processes in-progress to inform their future trajectories.
593981ddc50f90cdd3ae2701	We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate computer-generated reading comprehension questions about Wikipedia articles. Such application-specific ratings can be used to train statistical rankers to improve systems' final output, or to evaluate technologies that generate natural language. We discuss the question rating scheme we developed, assess the quality of the ratings that we gathered through Amazon Mechanical Turk, and show evidence that these ratings can be used to improve question generation.
59398333c50f90cdd3ae2761	While developing a suite of tools for statistical machine translation research, we recognized the need for a visualization tool that would allow researchers to examine and evaluate specific word correspondences generated by a translation system. We developed Cairo to fill this need. Cairo is a free, open-source, portable, user-friendly, GUI-driven program written in Java that provides a visual representation of word correspondences between bilingual pairs of sentences, as well as relevant translation model parameters.
59398479c50f90cdd3ae27bd	We introduce recurrent neural network grammars, probabilistic models of sentences with explicit phrase structure. We explain efficient inference procedures that allow application to both parsing and language modeling. Experiments show that they provide better parsing in English than any single previously published supervised generative model and better language modeling than state-of-the-art sequential RNNs in English and Chinese.
5939870ec50f90cdd3ae2877	We address the problem of selecting a point from a unit simplex, uniformly at random. This problem is important, for instance, when random multinomial probability distributions are required. We show that a previously proposed algorithm is incorrect, and demonstrate a corrected algorithm.
593987ecc50f90cdd3ae28b5	We present two latent variable models for learning character types, or personas, in film, in which a persona is defined as a set of mixtures over latent lexical classes. These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.
5959e232c50f90cdd3bbe4b7	Calculations of the cleavage strength σmax and of the shear strength τmax of ideally perfect crystals have been reviewed by Kelly (1966), and Tyson (1966) has carried out some accurate calculations using a computer. We have used these calculations in an attempt to predict the modes of failure at the tip of a crack.
5959e6e3c50f90cdd3bbe685	Summary The breaking strength of a real solid is not determined directly by the interatomic forces but by the properties of the imperfections that the solid contains. To be very strong a solid must resist both pltlstic yielding and brittle cracking. One material cannot normally resist both types of failure. Strong metals are designed to resist plastic yielding. Modern strong composite materials can be devised, in which brittle substances are used and a fibrous microstructure designed to arrest crack propagation.

595a21f8c50f90cdd3bbfd20	In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems:...
595a31ffc50f90cdd3bc0343	In the initial stages of deformation a mosaic structure is found within the deformed grains of the metal and the size of the mosaics reaches a lower limiting value, dependent on the particular metal. At heavy deformations these metals spontaneously recrystallize. The effects upon the mosaic structure of annealing at low temperatures and of recovery at room temperature have been studied. Some evidence is presented concerning the nature of recrystallization nuclei.
59398a8ec50f90cdd3ae2972	In this paper we aim to model the relationship between the text of a political blog post and the comment volume—that is, the total amount of response—that a post will receive. We seek to accurately identify which posts will attract a high-volume response, and also to gain insight about the community of readers and their interests. We design and evaluate variations on a latentvariable topic model that links text to comment volume.
59398b3cc50f90cdd3ae29a2	We address the challenge of automatically generating questions from reading materials for educational practice and assessment. Our approach is to overgenerate questions, then rank them. We use manually written rules to perform a sequence of general purpose syntactic transformations (eg, subject-auxiliary inversion) to turn declarative sentences into questions. These questions are then ranked by a logistic regression model trained on a small, tailored dataset consisting of labeled output from our system.
59398b9fc50f90cdd3ae29be	We propose a new algorithm for approximate MAP inference on factor graphs, by combining augmented Lagrangian optimization with the dual decomposition method. Each slave subproblem is given a quadratic penalty, which pushes toward faster consensus than in previous subgradient approaches. Our algorithm is provably convergent, parallelizable, and suitable for fine decompositions of the graph. We show how it can efficiently handle problems with (possibly global) structural constraints via simple sort operations.
59398c73c50f90cdd3ae29f9	Weighted deduction with aggregation is a powerful theoretical formalism that encompasses many NLP algorithms. This paper proposes a declarative specification language, Dyna; gives general agenda-based algorithms for computing weights and gradients; briefly discusses Dyna-to-Dyna program transformations; and shows that a first implementation of a Dyna-to-C++ compiler produces code that is efficient enough for real NLP research, though still several times slower than hand-crafted code.
59398cf7c50f90cdd3ae2a1f	We present fast, accurate, direct nonprojective dependency parsers with thirdorder features. Our approach uses AD3, an accelerated dual decomposition algorithm which we extend to handle specialized head automata and sequential head bigram models. Experiments in fourteen languages yield parsing speeds competitive to projective parsers, with state-ofthe-art accuracies for the largest datasets (English, Czech, and German).
59398de2c50f90cdd3ae2a61	We consider the problem of predicting a movie's opening weekend revenue. Previous work on this problem has used metadata about a movie---eg, its genre, MPAA rating, and cast---with very limited work making use of text about the movie. In this paper, we use the text of film critics' reviews from several sources to predict opening weekend revenue. We describe a new dataset pairing movie reviews with metadata and revenue data, and show that review text can substitute for metadata, and even improve over it, for prediction.
59398e94c50f90cdd3ae2a91	We present a simple log-linear reparameterization of IBM Model 2 that overcomes problems arising from Model 1's strong assumptions and Model 2's overparameterization. Efficient inference, likelihood evaluation, and parameter estimation algorithms are provided. Training the model is consistently ten times faster than Model 4. On three large-scale translation tasks, systems built using our alignment model outperform IBM Model 4.
59398fa9c50f90cdd3ae2ae2	We address the problem of part-of-speech tagging for English data from the popular micro-blogging service Twitter. We develop a tagset, annotate data, develop features, and report tagging results nearing 90% accuracy. The data and tools have been made available to the research community with the goal of enabling richer text analysis of Twitter and related social media data sets.
595a3438c50f90cdd3bc0426	The shape, number and arrangement of spots are studied on electron diffraction photographs of beaten gold foil. Various disturbing effects, including preferred orientation and refraction, on the deduction of particle size by spot counts are considered. After allowance for these a particle size of 1500 Å±50 is obtained.
595a3988c50f90cdd3bc0622	Correspondence 1529 configurations (i) and (iii) are possible. To distinguish between these two possibilities the specimen is mounted on a wedge-shaped holder which when inverted holds the specimen at an angle to the beam of about 45, the axis of tilt being made to lie approximately in the plane of the loop (fig. 7). Figure 4 shows the tilted view which eliminates configuration (iii). The loop is therefore of interstitial type.
595a3a72c50f90cdd3bc067b	Measurements of the strain-time curve have been made on silver specimens containing 40 per cent by volume of aligned tungsten wires at temperatures between 400° C and 600° C. The wires greatly reduce the rate of creep of the matrix. The rate of creep of composites containing discontinuous wires appears to be governed by the rate of creep of the matrix under the action of the shear stresses which arise close to the fibre-matrix interface.
595a3ce7c50f90cdd3bc076c	Recent work has shown that substructures are formed within the grains of a cold-worked polycrystalline metal. In this paper, methods are described by which the density of the excess dislocations of one sign in the boundaries between the particles can be found from data obtained from X-ray diffraction photographs. The methods may be extended to give estimates of the excess and total dislocation densities within the particles and the densities in annealed metals.
595a4419c50f90cdd3bc0a30	The gerrymandering problem is a worldwide problem which sets great threat to democracy and justice in district based elections. Thanks to partisan redistricting commissions, district boundaries are often manipulated to benefit incumbents. Since an independent commission is hard to come by, the possibility of impartially generating districts with a computer is explored in this thesis. We have developed an algorithm to randomly produce legal redistricting schemes for Pennsylvania.

593997d4c50f90cdd3ae2d10	This paper presents an algorithm that improves previous efforts to incorporate ecological models of foraging into automating exoplanetary exploration. The new budgeting strategy is an improvement over previous approaches in that it attempts to exhaust its sampling budget while exploring. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the budgeting algorithm is also a better approach for small budget sizes thank more traditional approaches based on principles from the design of experiments.
5939982ec50f90cdd3ae2d2b	Improvements in navigation autonomy present new opportunities to exploit kilometer-scale autonomous traverses. Here we review field tests of two specific new mission scenarios.

The Zoë platform investigates onboard science data understanding for intelligent, adaptive data collection in a surficial mapping task.
59399e53c50f90cdd3ae2ee5	All robotic systems require some form of motion control in order to build interesting behaviors. This is even more essential for multi-agent, highly-dynamic environments, such as robotic soccer. We present the motion control system used by CMUnited-98, the small-size league champion at RoboCup'98. We present the details of our motion vcontrol algorithm, and describe how its features help to build interesting and robust behaviors. We will also briefly compare our system to other motion control techniques.
5939a0e2c50f90cdd3ae2f99	This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition. The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednault's ADL [10] for propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP [6] for actions. Our hope is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.

5939a230c50f90cdd3ae2ff9	In this paper we present general theoretical models to improve the coordination between team members. We apply these models for passing, a coordination problem in soccer, and demonstrate the usefulness of these models. For the improvement of the team a trainer has been used to extract good passing behavior out of a set of games. The trainer improves this behavior and gives advice for the agents to improve its coordination.
595b14bfc50f90cdd3bc7c8a	There is a strong need for advances in the fields of image indexing and retrieval and visual query \nlanguages for multimedia databases.

Such data typically occupies a very broad domain, has been recorded in challenging conditions, with cheap hardware and a focus on the visual modality, and may have been post-processed or edited.
595bf55ac50f90cdd3bd13a7	We discuss nonparametric density estimation and regression for astrophysics problems. In particular, we show how to compute nonparametric confidence intervals for the location and size of peaks of a function. We illustrate these ideas with recent data on the Cosmic Microwave Background. We also briefly discuss nonparametric Bayesian inference.
594485e0c50f90cdd3b30334	Objective: Plan aggressive trajectories in densely cluttered environments via a computationally tractable algorithm, resulting in a complete methodology that yields optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories. Challenges: Generating feasible and safe trajectories in cluttered environments is computationally expensive due to the need to consider a large number of obstacles.
5945107ac50f90cdd3b34619	While exoskeleton assistance strategies have been explored for decades, devices that can reduce the metabolic cost of walking are relatively new [1]. Many of the current strategies use autonomous hardware and controllers specific to the hardware rather than the subject. Our lab uses an emulator system with lightweight end-effectors [2] and off-board motors and control hardware [3]. With this hardware, we can test a wide variety of control strategies over the course of a single experiment and can customize the assistance to the user.
595c0f4bc50f90cdd3bd22c8	Background De novo loss-of-function (dnLoF) mutations are found twofold more often in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) probands than their unaffected siblings. Multiple independent dnLoF mutations in the same gene implicate the gene in risk and hence provide a systematic, albeit arduous, path forward for ASD genetics. It is likely that using additional non-genetic data will enhance the ability to identify ASD genes.
595c213ac50f90cdd3bd2d38	Robot software systems tend to be complex. This complexity is due, in large part, to the need to control diverse sensors and actuators in real time, in the face of significant uncertainty and noise. Robot systems must work to achieve tasks while monitoring for, and reacting to, unexpected situations. Doing all this concurrently and asynchronously adds immensely to system complexity. The use of a well-conceived architecture, together with programming tools that support the architecture, can often help to manage that complexity.
595c2f45c50f90cdd3bd3567	The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class.
595c4401c50f90cdd3bd415f	An automated or autonomous vehicle obtains measurements from at least a first tire sensor, where the measurements reflect a grip state and/or grip margin. The tire sensor information be synchronized with location information, identifying a location where the tire sensor information was obtained.
595c442cc50f90cdd3bd4179	We empirically explore the application of (adaptations of) these algorithms to the kidney exchange problem, where patients with end-stage renal failure swap willing but incompatible donors. We show on both generated data and on real data from the first 169 match runs of the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange that even a very small number of non-adaptive edge queries per vertex results in large gains in expected successful matches.
595c442cc50f90cdd3bd417a	A computer system operates to determine a traction value for each of a plurality of regions of a road network. The computer system identifies a region of the road network for which the traction value is known. The computer system may direct a vehicle to operate over a region of the road network where the traction value is known, in order to obtain sensor data that is indicative of a traction capability of the vehicle.
595c444fc50f90cdd3bd418d	A computer system maintains, for a given geographic region, a data structure that identifies a traction value for each of a plurality of locations of a road network within a geographic region. At least of a start or destination location is determined for the trip. The computer system may plan the trip, including selecting at least one of a route or a vehicle to use for the trip, based on the traction values of one or more of the plurality of locations.
595c446bc50f90cdd3bd41a0	A computer system operates to determine a traction value for each of a plurality of regions of the road network. A region of the road network for which the traction value is unknown is identified. A vehicle is directed to operate over the region of the road network to obtain additional data that is indicative of a current traction value.
595c4498c50f90cdd3bd41bb	A vehicle determines an expected traction value for a region of a road segment on which the vehicle is approaching.

595c44b9c50f90cdd3bd41cf	A system and method to control a vehicle, provides for directing light onto a region of a road surface on which the vehicle is moving. A variation in a characteristic of a reflection of the directed light is determined. Accumulated precipitation is detected on at least the region of the road based on the determined variation.
595c48d7c50f90cdd3bd4436	Recall that we write n for the representation of the integer n in ML (and, in particular, 0= 0, 1= 1, etc.).

595c9512c50f90cdd3bd7097	Processor architectures with large instruction windows have been proposed to expose more instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and increase performance. Some of the proposed architectures replace a re-order buffer (ROB) with a check-pointing mechanism and an out-of-order release of processor resources. Check-pointing, however, leads to an imprecise processor state recovery on mis-predicted branches...
595cac9dc50f90cdd3bd7e54	We empirically explore the application of (adaptations of) these algorithms to the kidney exchange problem, where patients with end-stage renal failure swap willing but incompatible donors. We show on both generated data and on real data from the first 169 match runs of the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange that even a very small number of non-adaptive edge queries per vertex results in large gains in expected successful matches.

The method includes the steps of acquiring an object from a plurality of mixed objects at an input area, perceiving identifying indicia in connection with the object, assigning an intermediate station to a destination location for the object responsive to the identifying indicia in connection with the object, and moving the acquired object toward the intermediate station.
595cb9a1c50f90cdd3bd85ee	This short paper summarizes a game-theoretic model of human partial adaptation to the robot. We model the human as following a best-response strategy to the robot action, based on theor own, possibly distorted, reward function. The model allows the robot to take informative actions, in order to teach the human its capabilities.
594b4303c50f90cdd3b6a52a	In this article, by the semi-group theory, fractional calculus, stochastic analysis theory and the fixed-point technique, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of mild solutions and the approximate controllability of Caputo fractional neutral stochastic differential inclusions with state-dependent delay (under the assumption that the corresponding linear system is approximately controllable). An example is provided to illustrate the abstract results.
5960d5dac50f90cdd3c08212	Titanium and Titanium alloy can be used as medical implants and its corrision resistance to human body fluid should be studied. The ultrasonic fatigue test method has been used to investigate the gigacycle fatigue properties of commercial titanium alloy TC4 dipped into physiological saline solution for 24 h prior to testing. The results show that the physiological saline solution treatment hardly influences the ultrasonic fatigue life of TC4. The fractography pictures indicate the fracture to be transcrystalline plastic.

59611645c50f90cdd3c098e4	In order to apply recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) more effectively, the physical and mechanical proper-ties of recycled aggregates (RA) from quake-stricken area were tested. The mechanical properties and the strength variation against time of RAC with different RA replacement ratios were studied based on mixing design of different RAC. The results showed that the performance of RAs is different from NAs, such as higher porosity, 3.5 times high-er water absorption, 10% lower density and acceptable strength and surface texture.
595cfbdac50f90cdd3bdafa6	This paper presents an extension of the Additive Factors Model to predict learning for students by accounting for aspects of collaboration.

595cfc98c50f90cdd3bdb057	In this article, we first introduce the methodology for our recent work on password-composition policies [5, 6] and password meters [8], and define the metrics we used to measure the security and usability of passwords. We then highlight key results from these studies, paying particular attention to the lessons they hold for guiding real-world password creation.
595d057bc50f90cdd3bdb619	We present a hybrid system for reasoning over contextual and spatial elements of environments. The system, designed for deployment in robot architectures, leverages a knowledge base framework for common-sense reasoning through the integration with the symbolic and sub-symbolic structures of a cognitive architecture. Methodological and functional aspects are illustrated, together with an overview of the results obtained in a synthetic simulation experiment.
595d1b96c50f90cdd3bdd60c	During collaborative learning, computer-supported or otherwise, students balance task-oriented goals with the interpersonal goals of relationship-building; these goals may conflict, negatively impacting learning. In peer tutoring, for instance, tutors may avoid providing feedback to their partners to avoid the face-threat to their tutee. In this paper, we explore how the interpersonal closeness between tutor and tutee impacts tutors' use of indirectness with feedback and instructions, and the impact those moves have on tutees' problem-solving.
595d3147c50f90cdd3bde814	The message passing systems of parallel supercomputers typically bundle a rich set of services into their send and receive primitives. These services include the basic data transfer service, as well as message-level synchronization, flow control, selective receives, and buffer management. While this rich functionality greatly simplifies the job of the message passing programmer, it adds to communication overheads. Further, if the message passing program is generated by a parallelizing compiler, many of these services are not needed.

595e52b2c50f90cdd3bf4338	• Implement a PRM planner for a multi-link (at least four) robot arm. The arm can be a simple planar arm (which will simplify the graphics), or a 3D arm. The arm can be composed of line segments (which will make collision checking easier) rather than finite volume links. All you need to do is write code to detect the intersection between line segments and polygons. If you want, you can use collision checking software that is available on the web.

595e7157c50f90cdd3bf5fa1	This special issue comes amidst persistent and recently reignited debates about how and when to structure learning and problem-solving activities (Kirschner et al. 2006; Tobias and Duffy 2009). At the heart of the work reported in this special issue lies the incommensurability between learning and performance; that is, conditions that maximize performance in the short term may not necessarily be the ones that maximize learning in the long term (Schmidt and Bjork 1992). Two possibilities for designing instruction emerge.

595e747fc50f90cdd3bf6254	We introduce Socio-cultural Cognitive Mapping (SCM), a method to characterize populations based on shared attributes, placing these actors on a spatial representation. We introduce the technique, taking the reader through an overview of the algorithm. We conclude with an example use-case of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. In the Hatfield-McCoy case, the SCM process clearly delineates members of the opposing clans as well as gender.
595e962dc50f90cdd3bf7e12	A distributed asynchronous system in the shared memory model consists of a set of processes that communicate by accessing the shared memory. In this work, we study the totally anonymous shared memory model of asynchronous distributed computing. In this model processes are totally anonymous (they do not have unique names and all execute the same protocol) and non faulty; the registers can be atomically read and written by all processes. We also assume that shared registers are initialized to some known values.
595e9a91c50f90cdd3bf81d1	In this paper we describe a practical approach to processor selection for embedded computer vision applications.

595f4986c50f90cdd3bfd9f7	We prove a new structural result for symmetric submodular functions. We use that result to obtain an efficient algorithm for approximately learning such functions in the passive, supervised learning setting. We also complement this result with a nearly matching lower bound. Our work provides the first results for learning a large class of non-monotone submodular functions under general distributions.
595f8983c50f90cdd3bffc48	We introduce Salmon, a new method for quantifying transcript abundance from RNA-seq reads that is highly-accurate and very fast. Salmon is the first transcriptome-wide quantifier to model and correct for fragment GC content bias, which we demonstrate substantially improves the accuracy of abundance estimates and the reliability of subsequent differential expression analysis compared to existing methods that do not account for these biases. Salmon achieves its speed and accuracy by combining a new∗ rob. patro@ cs.
595f8b04c50f90cdd3bffd36	Existing methods for quantifying transcript abundance require a fundamental compromise: either use high quality read alignments and experiment-specific models or sacrifice them for speed. We introduce Salmon, a quantification method that overcomes this restriction by combining a novel 'lightweight'alignment procedure with a streaming parallel inference algorithm and a feature-rich bias model. These innovations yield both exceptional accuracy and order-of-magnitude speed benefits over traditional alignment-based methods.

59605cf6c50f90cdd3c053b6	The effect of the sand layer position in layered soil profile on the phreatic evaporation rate was researched through the laboratory simulating soil columns indoor. The mechanism was analyzed and the quantitative relationship between the evaporation rate and the sand layer position was discussed. The results showed that the sandy soil in layered soil profile can stimulate or obstacle the water movement as compared to the uniform loam column with 50cm depth of water table, this was mainly determined by the position of the sand layer.

It is closely similar to both C. montana and C. gracilifolia in having one or several flowers together with leaves arising from axillary buds of old branches, four spreading sepals, glabrous stamens and linear filaments, but differs from them in the usually 2-pinnate leaves with nine leaflets (vs. always ternate or ternate to 1-pinnate with three to five leaflets).
5960bb85c50f90cdd3c07859	The method of using directly regression analysis to deal with dam measured data is easily disturbed by noises. In the paper a new method is proposed, where the measurement data are first denoised by the wavelet, and then the denoised signals are disposed by the one variant linear regression analysis. Simulation results show that, compared with using one variant linear regression direct analysis, our method can get more accurate unknown coefficients.
5960c37cc50f90cdd3c07b47	The mechanical properties of basalt fiber reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) with fiber dosage of 0, 2 and 4 kg/m3 were tested. The result showed that the highest density of RAC is obtained when the fiber dosage is 2 kg/m3. When the fiber dosage is less than 2 kg/m3, the tensile strength has the tendency of degradation. The mechanical performance of RAC with 50% recycled coarse aggregate increases greatly when the fiber dosage is 4 kg/m3.

59c2c4bec50f90cdd3fa38ce	The act of revising is an important aspect of academic writing. Although revision is crucial for eliminating writing errors and producing high-quality texts, research on writing expertise shows that novices rarely engage in revision activities. Providing information on writing errors by means of peer feedback has become a popular method in writing instruction. However, despite its popularity, students have difficulties in leveraging the potential of peer feedback: feedback uptake is low and students engage in little revision.
59c2c96cc50f90cdd3fa3b14	Abstract—In open-ended tasks where a program's behavior cannot be specified in advance, exploratory programming is a key practice in which programmers actively experiment with different possibilities using code. Exploratory programming is highly relevant today to a variety of professional and end-user programmer domains, including prototyping, learning through play, digital art, and data science. However, prior research has largely lacked clarity on what exploratory programming is, and what behaviors are characteristic of this practice.

Besides the orthorhombic Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 as the major phase, BITW-yCr ceramics also contain the cubic Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 as the second phase which was formed due to the doping effect of WO 3, but its formation could be depressed by the addition of less Cr 2 O 3.
59c4d229c50f90cdd3fb6f55	ABSTRACT. Through our own results and from literatures it is observed that the micro plasticity in the gigacycle fatigue induced more than dislocations sliding. Sometime, phase transformation, refining of the grain, twinning, and instability of the yield point, occur even when the loading is small during a very high number of cycles. In high carbon content and in high strength steel, there is a transformation of the microstructure starting from a defect, in relation with the stress concentration and the stress field.

59c544d2c50f90cdd3fb9367	A cluster tree provides a highly-interpretable summary of a density function by representing the hierarchy of its high-density clusters. It is estimated using the empirical tree, which is the cluster tree constructed from a density estimator. This paper addresses the basic question of quantifying our uncertainty by assessing the statistical significance of features of an empirical cluster tree. We first study a variety of metrics that can be used to compare different trees, analyze their properties and assess their suitability for inference.
59c5453fc50f90cdd3fb9390	MANUSCRIPT IN PROGRESS We investigate the asymptotic consistency of causal inference procedures in the framework of directed acyclic graphs (DAG's) as developed by Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines (SGS) and Pearl and Verma (PV). We show that there exist “point—wise consistent” but not “uniformly consistent” procedures. These results have implications for making inferences based on ﬁnite sample sizes and for construct-ing valid conﬁdence intervals for causal effects.

We fit the model on a set of realistic mock spectra and we find that accurate predictions of the continuum are obtained.
59c56ce1c50f90cdd3fb9fb7	The bootstrap is a method for estimating standard errors and computing confidence intervals. Let T n= g (X 1,…, X n) be a statistic, that is, T n is any function of the data. Suppose we want to know VF (T n), the variance of T n. We have written VF to emphasize that the variance usually depends on the unknown distribution function F.
59c56e17c50f90cdd3fba00b	The incredible variety of galaxy shapes cannot be summarized by human defined discrete classes of shapes without causing a possibly large loss of information. Dictionary learning and sparse coding allow us to reduce the high dimensional space of shapes into a manageable low dimensional continuous vector space. Statistical inference can be done in the reduced space via probability distribution estimation and manifold estimation.
59c56f1ec50f90cdd3fba051	The most important aspect of probability theory concerns the behavior of sequences of random variables. This part of probability is called large sample theory, or limit theory, or asymptotic theory. The basic question is this: what can we say about the limiting behavior of a sequence of random variables X 1, X 2, X 3,...? Since statistics and data mining are all about gathering data, we will naturally be interested in what happens as we gather more and more data.
59c56fe5c50f90cdd3fba08a	Saarela et al. are concerned with integrating propensity scores into a Bayesian framework. Some of us have previously written (Robins and Ritov, 1997; Robins and Wasserman, 2000; http://normaldeviate. wordpress. com/2012/08/28/robins-and-wasserman-respond-to-a-nobelprize-winner/; posted 28 Aug 2012, accessed 1 Oct 2014) about this topic, every time making much the same argument. Here we present a simplified version that captures the main points.
59c57172c50f90cdd3fba0f1	A filament is a high density, connected region in a point cloud. There are several methods for estimating filaments but these methods do not provide any measure of uncertainty. We give a definition for the uncertainty of estimated filaments and we study statistical properties of the estimated filaments. We show how to estimate the uncertainty measures and we construct confidence sets based on a bootstrapping technique. We apply our methods to astronomy data and earthquake data.
59c57190c50f90cdd3fba0fa	We present a nonparametric method for selecting informative features in high-dimensional clustering problems. We start with a screening step that uses a test for multimodality. Then we apply kernel density estimation and mode clustering to the selected features. The output of the method consists of a list of relevant features, and cluster assignments. We provide explicit bounds on the error rate of the resulting clustering. In addition, we provide the first error bounds on mode based clustering.

5999e37dc50f90cdd3e2a89b	Understanding smartphone users is fundamental for creating better smartphones, improving the smartphone usage experience, and generating generalizable and reproducible research. However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users.

599aca66c50f90cdd3e34549	Disclosed herein is a composite comprising a conductive elastomer and an isolating elastomer. When a current is passed through the conductive elastomer, its tensile modulus decreases as the elastomer heats from internal Joule heating, changing the rigidity of the composite. When the current is no longer present, the elastomer cools and the rigidity of the composite returns to its original state.
599aca8cc50f90cdd3e34558	Disclosed herein is a composite comprising an elastomer with an embedded network of liquid metal inclusions. The composite retains similar flexibility to that of an elastomer but exhibits electrical and thermal properties that differ from the properties of a homogeneous elastomer. The composite has applications for wearable devices and other soft matter electronics, among others.
599b28d2c50f90cdd3e372b8	We first initialize the topic mixtures (θ,∆) and topic-word distributions (φ) of the model using latent Dirichlet allocation. 1 In each iteration, we sampled the latent variables a, b, ψ, θ,∆, χ, and π in turn using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hastings, 1970). We discarded samples from the first 1,500 iterations (burn-in) and keeping every 10th subsequent sample to compute the posterior mean. In total, we performed 3,000 iterations over the data.

The authors aim to examine the interaction between patients' health conditions and treatment approaches, and learn the most common pathways of care to inform better patient engagement and outcomes in healthcare practices.
59c574edc50f90cdd3fba1e2	Persistent homology is a method for probing topological properties of point clouds and functions. The method involves tracking the birth and death of topological features as one varies a tuning parameter. Features with short lifetimes are informally considered to be “topological noise,” and those with a long lifetime are considered to be “topological signal.” In this paper, we bring some statistical ideas to persistent homology. In particular, we derive confidence sets that allow us to separate topological signal from topological noise.
59c596a9c50f90cdd3fbaa7a	Density mode clustering is a nonparametric clustering method. The clusters are the basins of attraction of the modes of a density estimator. We study the risk of mode-based clustering. We show that the clustering risk over the cluster cores---the regions where the density is high---is very small even in high dimensions. And under a low noise condition, the overall cluster risk is small even beyond the cores, in high dimensions.
59c596f3c50f90cdd3fbaa8c	Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can broadly be described as a collection of data analysis methods that find structure in data. This includes: clustering, manifold estimation, nonlinear dimension reduction, mode estimation, ridge estimation and persistent homology. This paper reviews some of these methods.
59c59d95c50f90cdd3fbac44	We study the plug-in estimator for density level sets under Hausdorff loss. We derive asymptotic theory for this estimator, and based on this theory, we develop two bootstrap confidence regions for level sets. We introduce a new technique for visualizing density level sets, even in multidimensions, which is easy to interpret and efficient to compute. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
59c5a1c1c50f90cdd3fbad55	The large sample theory of estimators for density modes is well understood. In this paper we consider density ridges, which are a higher-dimensional extension of modes. Modes correspond to zero-dimensional, local high-density regions in point clouds. Density ridges correspond to $ s $-dimensional, local high-density regions in point clouds. We establish three main results. First we show that under appropriate regularity conditions, the local variation of the estimated ridge can be approximated by an empirical process.
599ca73ac50f90cdd3e44a30	With the increasing ubiquity of email and web related technologies in supporting and documenting tasks there arises a need to summarize a user's interactions and activities over a period of time. We describe a learningbased system for generating reports based on a mix of text and event data. The report drafting system is part of a learning cognitive assistant, implemented using web technologies. The system incorporates several stages of processing, including aggregation, template-filling and importance ranking.

The method includes forming an opening through an etch layer and to a barrier layer, expanding the opening in the etch layer at the barrier layer, filling the opening with a material, removing the barrier layer from the material in the opening, and removing the etch layer from the material in the opening.
59627851c50f90cdd3c10448	We develop the first polynomial-time algorithm for co-training of homogeneous linear separators under\\em weak dependence, a relaxation of the condition of independence given the label. Our algorithm learns from purely unlabeled data, except for a single labeled example to break symmetry of the two classes, and works for any data distribution having an inverse-polynomial margin and with center of mass at the origin.
596312eec50f90cdd3c11825	Distributed applications are difficult to program reliably and securely. Dependently typed functional languages promise to prevent broad classes of errors and vulnerabilities, and to enable program verification to proceed side-by-side with development. However, as recursion, effects, and rich libraries are added, using types to reason about programs, specifications, and proofs becomes challenging. We present F⋆, a full-fledged design and implementation of a new dependently typed language for secure distributed programming.
59632ad1c50f90cdd3c11b2b	SML is a language for describing complex ﬁnite state hardware controllers. It provides many of the standard control structures found in modern programming languages. The state tables produced by the SML compiler can be used as input to a temporal logic model checker that can automatically determine whether u speciﬁcation in the logic CTI. is satisﬁed. We describe extensions to SML for the design of modular controllers. These extensions allnw a compositional approach to model checking which can substantially reduce its complexity.

Backchannels may provide a partial answer to this question, possibly in combination with some other events, such as gaze behaviors of the interlocutors. We look at some patterns in multi-party interaction relating features of backchannel behaviours to aspects of the partipation framework.
59a9e3a3c50f90cdd3ea44ea	Abstract—We built an instrumented screwdriver stage to detect categories of failures not previously documented and to record their sensor information for future prediction. Our data collection process was arduous, relying on manual resets and data labeling, but the low incidence of failure in the operation required a large number of runs. Furthermore, the data collection process itself damaged the screws and affected the results. We intend to design another collection process with more automation to gather more and better data.

596c3fe9c50f90cdd3c9bfb0	In the simplified models of evolution discussed in Section 1.3, we consider individuals belonging to a single species–ie, sharing the same genetic encoding, and reproducing with each other. We assume this species evolves in isolation, in an almost unchanging environment. In nature, species live in the niches afforded by other species, modifying themselves and the environment and being affected by such modifications.

While previous research has shown that bacterial motion is non-ergodic, we demonstrate that, besides the non-ergodicity, the bacterial swimming dynamics is multi-fractal in nature.

This paper explores how robotic chairs might negotiate passage in shared spaces with people, using motion as an expressive cue. The user study evaluates the efficacy of three gestures at convincing a busy participant to let it by. This within-participants study consisted of three subsequent trials, in which a person is completing a puzzle on a standing desk and a robotic chair approaches to squeeze by. The measure was whether participants moved out of the robot's way or not.

This work analyzes the ability of thermal imaging to detect hazardous, low-density regolith in shadowed regions on the lunar poles. A series of simulations was conducted to estimate the surface temperature of lunar regolith as a function of density in polar craters.

Each Zi is divided into M/α blocks of size α× β and Zi 0, α counts the number of blocks of which at least one element is non-zero. α and β need to be chosen such that D and M are perfectly divisible. Definition 1. If any valid solution {ˆD, ˆZ} to the objective in Equation 1 is ambiguous only up to a M× M block permutation matrix Pα and a block-diagonal invertible weighting matrix Λα such that ˆD= DPαΛα, and ˆZ= Λ− 1 α PT α Z, we say X has a unique BSDL.

59af255ec50f90cdd3ed455d	Abstract—Many data center applications are latency-sensitive. Monitoring continuously the network latency and reacting to congestion on a network path is important to ensure that the applications performance does not suffer penalties. We show how to use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to infer network latency and packet loss in data centers, and we conduct network latency and packet loss measurements in data centers from different cloud providers, using PTPd, an open-source software implementation of PTP.

59afd517c50f90cdd3edc111	The ACL 2014 Workshop on Language Technologies and Computational Social Science was held on June 26, 2014 in Baltimore, following the 52nd annual meeting of the ACL. The workshop's goal was to increase the visibility of computational social science—in which automated techniques are applied to massive datasets to answer scientific questions about society—for ACL researchers and to help build connections between language technologists and social scientists.
59afd539c50f90cdd3edc342	This paper describes the construction of a computational representation of a social network of corporations in the United States. Applying tools from natural language processing and machine learning to a corpus of publicly available press releases, we have extracted a network of more than 1.7 million connections. We describe the methods used, preliminary analysis, and a visualization tool enabling further exploration.
59b01a5ec50f90cdd3ede248	We present an unsupervised model for the discovery and clustering of latent “personas”(characterizations of entities). Our model simultaneously clusters documents featuring similar collections of personas. We evaluate this model on a collection of news articles about immigration, showing that personas help predict the coarse-grained framing annotations in the Media Frames Corpus. We also introduce automated model selection as a fair and robust form of feature evaluation.
59b01cafc50f90cdd3ede353	We describe a research activity carried out during January–April 2014, seeking to increase engagement between the natural language processing research community and social science scholars. In this activity, participants were offered a corpus of text relevant to the 2007–8 financial crisis and an open-ended prompt. Their responses took the form of a short paper and an optional demonstration, to which a panel of judges will respond with the goal of identifying efforts with the greatest potential for future interdisciplinary collaboration.
59b03fadc50f90cdd3edf2ff	The attendees of the workshop considered information retrieval research in the areas of retrieval models, cross-language retrieval, Web search, user modeling, filtering, TDT, classification, summarization, question answering, metasearch, distributed retrieval, multimedia retrieval, information extraction, as well as testbed requirements for future work. The potential use of language modeling techniques in these areas was also discussed.
59b04c25c50f90cdd3edf897	Management decisions underpinning availability of ecosystem services and the organisms that provide them in agroecosystems, such as pollinators and pollination services, have emerged as a foremost consideration for both conservation and crop production goals. There is growing evidence that innovative management practices can support diverse pollinators and increase crop pollination. However, there is also considerable debate regarding factors that support adoption of these innovative practices.
59b07df4c50f90cdd3ee0ed6	Abstract—We built an instrumented screwdriver stage to detect categories of failures not previously documented and to record their sensor information for future prediction. Our data collection process was arduous, relying on manual resets and data labeling, but the low incidence of failure in the operation required a large number of runs. Furthermore, the data collection process itself damaged the screws and affected the results. We intend to design another collection process with more automation to gather more and better data.
5984517ec50f90cdd3d8a70e	Reading comprehension (RC), aiming to understand natural texts and answer questions therein, is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the RC problem on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Observing from the training set that most correct answers are centered around constituents in the parse tree, we design a constituent-centric neural architecture where the generation of candidate answers and their representation learning are both based on constituents and guided by the parse tree.
59845e21c50f90cdd3d8adcf	We demonstrate a CMOS-MEMS resonant demodulator for use in a nanoWatt-power RF wake-up sensor.“Near-zero” power operation is enabled through voltage step-up and frequency keying in passive MEMS elements. The integrated MEMS demodulator minimizes parasitic capacitance to maximize gain and performs high-Q filtering to prevent false triggering due to interference signal feedthrough. High-frequency testing of a demodulator with a minimum transduction gap size of 400 nm agrees with device models.

59b0bc05c50f90cdd3ee2a83	We describe a new dependency parser for English tweets, TWEEBOPARSER. The parser builds on several contributions: new syntactic annotations for a corpus of tweets (TWEEBANK), with conventions informed by the domain; adaptations to a statistical parsing algorithm; and a new approach to exploiting out-of-domain Penn Treebank data. Our experiments show that the parser achieves over 80% unlabeled attachment accuracy on our new, high-quality test set and measure the benefit of our contributions.

59b16f95c50f90cdd3eebde7	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Since there are many mission-critical DOD requirements for ultra-dependable systems, most of which must, by their nature, be distributed, it is essential to establish a development process that makes routine the design/construction of systems with an almost arbitrarily specified dependability1 and supports analysis of the costbenefit trade-offs for obtaining this level of dependability.
59b26948c50f90cdd3ef5c06	Ni-base superalloys are used under sever conditions like a high temperature or sever corrosive environment because of their superior properties on corrosion, creep, static strength at high temperatures and so on. Therefore, many studies on creep and fatigue properties of the alloy have been carried out, eg Brown and Hicks [1]. Recently, it is very important to know the fatigue properties in long life region, because machines and structures are used for long-term from the point of view of environmental and economical demands.

598952bdc50f90cdd3dbc24e	Fatigue behaviour of AISI 310 stainless steel has been investigated up to very high cycles. The fatigue crack initiation sites were found at the surface of the material. Persistent slip bands developed at the surface of the specimens led to the crack initiation. At lower stress levels, shallow persistent slip bands were found at the surface of the specimens, and the fatigue limit was obtained.

59b2a313c50f90cdd3ef72b1	This paper presents an experimental research on timber columns with externally bonded fibre reinforced polymer sheets, which consist of aramid fibre reinforced polymer, carbon fibre reinforced polymer and basalt fibre reinforced polymer. This is to provide a strengthening solution to upgrade the structural behaviour and load carrying capacities of such columns under the influence of fractured wood texture. In total, 14 columns were constructed and tested, consisting of 8 circular timber columns and 6 square ones.
59b2a3abc50f90cdd3ef72e7	In order to comparatively assess near-neutral pH stress corrosion cracking (NNpH-SCC) resistance of pipeline steels with different strength, constant load tests in NS4 solution purged with 5% CO 2–N 2 gas mixture were conducted on American Petroleum Institute (API) grade X70, X80 and X100 pipeline steels. Experimental results show that pit cracks appeared on the surface of X70 steel and non-pit cracks appeared on X100 steel. However, for X80 steel both pit cracks and non-pit cracks were observed, but pit cracks dominated.

The submission is a system combination which combines seven different statistical machine translation systems provided by the different groups.
59b3e7d8c50f90cdd3f03af5	We propose to score phrase translation pairs for statistical machine translation using term weight based models. These models employ tf. idf to encode the weights of content and non-content words in phrase translation pairs. The translation probability is then modeled by similarity functions defined in a vector space. Two similarity functions are compared. Using these models in a statistical machine translation task shows significant improvements.

59b54901c50f90cdd3f0d6e2	We describe a method for using abstraction to reduce the complexity of temporal logic model checking. The basis of this method is a way of constructing an abstract model of a program without ever examining the corresponding unabstracted model. We show how this abstract model can be used to verify properties of the original program. We have implemented a system based on these techniques, and we demonstrate their practicality using a number of examples, including a pipelined ALU circuit with over 101300 states.
59898fedc50f90cdd3dbd8d3	Fatigue properties of age-hardened Al alloy 2017-T4 under ultrasonic loading frequency (20 kHz) were investigated and compared with the results under conventional loading of rotating bending (50 Hz). The growth of a crack retarded at about 500 µm in surface length under ultrasonic loading, while at about 20 µm under rotating bending. Although striations being a typical fracture mechanism were observed under conventional loading, most of fracture surface was covered with many facets under ultrasonic loading.
5989afd1c50f90cdd3dbe693	Carbon-manganese steel is often applied in components of pipes in nuclear plant. Ultrasonic fatigue tests following low cycle fatigue (LCF) cycles damaged are used to study the strength of very high cycle fatigure (VHCF). The comparison of test results of simple VHCF and cumulative fatigue (LCF plus VHCF) shows that LCF load influences the following VHCF strength. Continuum damage mechanics model is extended to VHCF region. The effect of LCF load on VHCF is studied by an improved cumulative damage model.

59bec473c50f90cdd3f7001e	Abstract—In open-ended tasks where a program's behavior cannot be specified in advance, exploratory programming is a key practice in which programmers actively experiment with different possibilities using code. Exploratory programming is highly relevant today to a variety of professional and end-user programmer domains, including prototyping, learning through play, digital art, and data science. However, prior research has largely lacked clarity on what exploratory programming is, and what behaviors are characteristic of this practice.
59bf2022c50f90cdd3f74dc0	The emergence of extremely energy-efficient processor architectures creates the potential for computing and sensing systems that operate entirely using energy extracted from their environment. Such energy-harvesting systems can use energy from radio waves [Sample et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2011a], solar energy [Lee et al. 2012; Zac Manchester 2015], and other environmental sources. An energy-harvesting system operates only intermittently when energy is available in the environment and experiences a power failure otherwise.
59bf6263c50f90cdd3f7b2a7	Varied sources of error contribute to the challenge of facial action unit detection. Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else; a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples.
59bf9622c50f90cdd3f7de73	In this library, the COBWEB and COBWEB/3 algorithms are implemented. These systems accept a stream of instances, which are represented as dictionaries of attributes and values (where values can be nominal for COBWEB and either numeric or nominal for COBWEB/3), and learns a concept hierarchy. The resulting hierarchy can be used for clustering and prediction.
598a2a06c50f90cdd3dc2cef	Nowadays, cancer is one of the most fatal threatens to human health. By utilizing the differences of cell environment between cancer cells and their normal counterparts as assembly-disassembly triggers, various smart drug nanocarriers have been designed to fight the cancer. Nevertheless, most of them are still not robust enough. One important reason is that they merely focus on a single stimulus. Thus, in order to achieve a better therapeutic effect, constructing multi responsive polymers is of great significance.

The process of bulge removal should leave only the red edges remaining, yielding an Eulerian path in the resulting graph.
5998accbc50f90cdd3e1d10a	Abstract—We consider the problem of planning a collisionfree path for a high-dimensional robot. Specifically, we suggest a planning framework where a motion-planning algorithm can obtain guidance from a user. In contrast to existing approaches, we suggest to seek user guidance only when the planner identifies that it is in a local minimum, namely, when it ceases to make significant progress towards the goal. User guidance is given in the form of an intermediate configuration q which, in turn, is used to bias the planner to go through q.

5999a64bc50f90cdd3e28859	Transaction-level modeling with SystemC has been very successful in describing the behavior of embedded systems by providing high-level executable models, in which many of them have inherent probabilistic behaviors, eg, random data and unreliable components. It is thus crucial to have both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the probabilities of system properties.
5999a798c50f90cdd3e28927	This paper describes PSCV, a runtime verification tool for a class of SystemC models which have inherent probabilistic characteristics.

The various features of the tool including automatic monitor generation for producing execution traces of the model-under-verification, mechanism for automatically instrumenting the model, and the interaction with statistical model checker are presented.
59c47d1cc50f90cdd3fb2a77	Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells will have variations in their gene expression, copy numbers, and mutation even when coming from a single tumor. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells is of paramount importance for unmasking the underlying the tumor heterogeneity. However extracting features from the single cell genomic data coherent with the underlying biology is computationally challenging, given the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data.

Arguments are presented here suggesting that simplicity has little place in discussions of modeling; instead, the concept of flexibility should be substituted. When comparing two models one should...
59c549bbc50f90cdd3fb9533	We have considered several point estimators such as the maximum likelihood estimator, the method of moments estimator, and the posterior mean. In fact, there are many other ways to generate estimators. How do we choose among them? The answer is found in decision theory which is a formal theory for comparing statistical procedures.
59c54a66c50f90cdd3fb9573	Undirected graphs are an alternative to directed graphs for representing independence relations. Since both directed and undirected graphs are used in practice, it is a good idea to be facile with both. The main difference between the two is that the rules for reading independence relations from the graph are different.
59c54d78c50f90cdd3fb9691	We find the minimax rate of convergence in Hausdorff distance for estimating a manifold M of dimension d embedded in RD given a noisy sample from the manifold. We assume that the manifold satisfies a smoothness condition and that the noise distribution has compact support. We show that the optimal rate of convergence is n− 2/(2+ d). Thus, the minimax rate depends only on the dimension of the manifold, not on the dimension of the space in which M is embedded.
59c54dfcc50f90cdd3fb96c2	We find the minimax rate of convergence in Hausdorff distance for estimating a manifold M of dimension d embedded in RD given a noisy sample from the manifold.

Advances were also made on the new research area of resource-constrained statistical estimation.
59c56980c50f90cdd3fb9ecd	Suppose we want to know if exposure to asbestos is associated with lung disease. We take some rats and randomly divide them into two groups. We expose one group to asbestos and leave the second group unexposed. Then we compare the disease rate in the two groups. Consider the following two hypotheses: The Null Hypothesis: The disease rate is the same in the two groups. The Alternative Hypothesis: The disease rate is not the same in the two groups.
cscw18social	Eye tracking is a compelling tool for revealing people's spatial-temporal distribution of visual attention. But quality eye tracking hardware is expensive and can only be used with one person at a time. Further, webcam eye tracking systems have significant limitations on head movement and lighting conditions that result in significant data loss and inaccuracies. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a new approach that harnesses the crowd to understand allocation of visual attention. In our approach, crowdsourcing participants use mouse clicks to self-report the positions and trajectory for the following valuable eye tracking measures: first gaze, last gaze and all gazes. We validate our crowdsourcing approach with a user study, which demonstrated good accuracy when compared to a real eye tracker. We then deployed our prototype, GazeCrowd, in a crowdsourcing setting, and showed that it accurately generated gaze heatmaps and trajectory maps. Such an approach will allow designers to evaluate and refine their visual design without requiring the use of limited/expensive eye trackers.
cscw18towards	A growing number of large collaborative idea generation platforms promise that by generating ideas together, people can create better ideas than any would have alone. But how might these platforms best leverage the number and diversity of contributors to help each contributor generate even better ideas? Prior research suggests that seeing particularly creative or diverse ideas from others can inspire you, but few scalable mechanisms exist to assess diversity. We contribute a new scalable crowd-powered method for evaluating the diversity of sets of ideas. The method relies on similarity comparisons (is idea A more similar to B or C) generated by non-experts to create an abstract spatial idea map. Our validation study reveals that human raters agree with the estimates of dissimilarity derived from our idea map as much or more than they agree with each other. People seeing the diverse sets of examples from our idea map generate more diverse ideas than those seeing randomly selected examples. Our results also corroborate findings from prior research showing that people presented with creative examples generated more creative ideas than those who saw a set of random examples. We see this work as a step toward building more effective online systems for supporting large scale collective ideation.
cscw18girls	Social identities carry widely agreed upon meanings, called stereotypes, that have important effects on social processes. In the present work, we develop a method to extract the stereotypes of Twitter users. Our method is grounded in two distinct strands of theory, one that represents stereotypes as identities' affective meanings and the other that represents stereotypes as semantic relationships between identities. After validating our approach via a prediction task, we apply the model to a dataset of 45 thousand Twitter users who actively tweeted about the Michael Brown and Eric Garner tragedies. Our work provides unique insights into the stereotypes of these users, as well as providing a way of quantifying stereotypes that blends existing sociological and psychological theory in a novel, parsimonious way.
cscw18ideahound	One main challenge in large creative online communities is helping their members find inspirational ideas from a large pool of ideas. A high-level approach to address this challenge is to create a synthesis of emerging solution space that can be used to provide participants with creative and diverse inspirational ideas of others. Existing approaches to generate the synthesis of solution space either require community members to engage in tasks that detract from the main activity of generating ideas or depend on external crowd workers to help organize the ideas. We built IDEAHOUND a collaborative idea generation system that demonstrates an alternative “organic” human computation approach, where community members (rather than external crowds) contribute feedback about ideas as a byproduct of an activity that naturally integrates into the ideation process. This feedback in turn helps the community identify diverse inspirational ideas that can prompt community members to generate more high-quality and diverse ideas.

However, standard touch interactions, such as dragging to move content, do not scale well to large surfaces and were not designed to support collaboration, such as passing an object around. This paper introduces CoReach, a set of collaborative gestures that combine input from multiple users in order to manipulate content, facilitate data exchange and support communication. We conducted an observational study to inform the design of CoReach, and a controlled study showing that it reduced physical fatigue and facilitated collaboration when compared with traditional multi-touch gestures. A final study assessed the value of also allowing input through a handheld tablet to manipulate content from a distance.
cscw18what	Recent research has demonstrated that (a) groups can be characterized by a collective intelligence (CI) factor that measures their ability to perform together on a wide range of different tasks, and (b) this factor can predict groups' performance on other tasks in the future. The current study examines whether these results translate into the world of teams in competitive online video games where self-organized, time-pressured, and intense collaboration occurs purely online. In this study of teams playing the online game League of Legends, we find that CI does, indeed, predict the competitive performance of teams controlling for the amount of time played as a team. We also find that CI is positively correlated with the presence of a female team member and with the team members' average social perceptiveness. Finally, unlike in prior studies, tacit coordination in this setting plays a larger role than verbal communication.
cscw18acomparison	A significant challenge for crowdsourcing has been increasing worker engagement and output quality. We explore the effects of social, learning, and financial strategies, and their combinations, on increasing worker retention across tasks and change in the quality of worker output. Through three experiments, we show that 1) using these strategies together increased workers' engagement and the quality of their work; 2) a social strategy was most effective for increasing engagement; 3) a learning strategy was most effective in improving quality. The findings of this paper provide strategies for harnessing the crowd to perform complex tasks, as well as insight into crowd workers' motivation.
cscw18when	Many people appropriate social media and online communities in their pursuit of personal health goals, such as healthy eating or increased physical activity. However, people struggle with impression management, and with reaching the right audiences when they share health information on these platforms. Instagram, a popular photo-based social media platform, has attracted many people who post and share their food photos. We aim to inform the design of tools to support healthy behaviors by understanding how people appropriate Instagram to track and share food data, the benefits they obtain from doing so, and the challenges they encounter. We interviewed 16 women who consistently record and share what they eat on Instagram. Participants tracked to support themselves and others in their pursuit of healthy eating goals. They sought social support for their own tracking and healthy behaviors and strove to provide that support for others. People adapted their personal tracking practices to better receive and give this support. Applying these results to the design of health tracking tools has the potential to help people better access social support.
cscw18discrete	As a central element within the RAS/ERK pathway, the serine/threonine kinase BRAF plays a key role in development and homeostasis and represents the most frequently mutated kinase in tumors. Consequently, it has emerged as an important therapeutic target in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the BRAF activation cycle still raises many mechanistic questions as illustrated by the paradoxical action and side effects of RAF inhibitors. By applying SEC-PCP-SILAC, we analyzed protein-protein interactions of hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) and wild-type BRAF (BRAF(WT)). We identified two macromolecular, cytosolic BRAF complexes of distinct molecular composition and phosphorylation status. Hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) resides in large complexes of higher molecular mass and activity, while BRAF(WT) is confined to smaller, slightly less active complexes. However, expression of oncogenic K-Ras(G12V), either by itself or in combination with RAF dimer promoting inhibitors, induces the incorporation of BRAF(WT) into large, active complexes, whereas pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V)(600E) has the opposite effect. Thus, the quaternary structure of BRAF complexes is shaped by its activation status, the conformation of its kinase domain, and clinically relevant inhibitors. 
cscw18assessment	Security requirements analysis depends on how well-trained analysts perceive security risk, understand the impact of various vulnerabilities, and mitigate threats. When systems are composed of multiple machines, configurations, and software components that interact with each other, risk perception must account for the composition of security requirements. In this paper, we report on how changes to security requirements affect analysts risk perceptions and their decisions about how to modify the requirements to reach adequate security levels. We conducted two user surveys of 174 participants wherein participants assess security levels across 64 factorial vignettes. We analyzed the survey results using multi-level modeling to test for the effect of security requirements composition on participants' overall security adequacy ratings and on their ratings of individual requirements. We accompanied this analysis with grounded analysis of elicited requirements aimed at lowering the security risk. Our results suggest that requirements composition affects experts' adequacy ratings on security requirements. In addition, we identified three categories of requirements modifications, called refinements, replacements and reinforcements, and we measured how these categories compare with overall perceived security risk. Finally, we discuss the future impact of our work in security requirements assessment practice.
