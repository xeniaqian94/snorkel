"Sharing scientific data, software, and instruments is becoming increasingly common as science moves toward large-scale, distributed collaborations",Background,SMZ5P2JC
Sharing these resources requires extra work to make them generally useful,Background,SMZ5P2JC
"Although we know much about the extra work associated with sharing data,",Background,SMZ5P2JC
"we know little about the work associated with sharing contributions to software, even though software is of vital importance to nearly every scientific result",Purpose,SMZ5P2JC
"This paper presents a qualitative, interview-based study of the extra work that developers and end users of scientific software undertake",Method,SMZ5P2JC
"Our findings indicate that they conduct a rich set of extra work around community management, code maintenance, education and training, developer-user interaction, and foreseeing user needs",Findings,SMZ5P2JC
"We identify several conditions under which they are likely to do this work, as well as design principles that can facilitate it",Findings,SMZ5P2JC
"Crowd feedback systems offer designers an emerging approach for improving their designs,",Background,T4S3K5ZT
but there is little empirical evidence of the benefit of these systems,Purpose,T4S3K5ZT
This paper reports the results of a study of using a crowd feedback system to iterate on visual designs,Purpose,T4S3K5ZT
Users in an introductory visual design course created initial designs satisfying a design brief and received crowd feedback on the designs,Method,T4S3K5ZT
Users revised the designs and the system was used to generate feedback again,Method,T4S3K5ZT
This format enabled us to detect the changes between the initial and revised designs and how the feedback related to those changes,Method,T4S3K5ZT
"Further, we analyzed the value of crowd feedback by comparing it with expert evaluation and feedback generated via free-form prompts",Method,T4S3K5ZT
"In a variety of peer production settings, from Wikipedia to open source software development to crowdsourcing, individuals may encounter, edit, or review the work of unknown others",Background,T8P7HT8E
Typically this is done without much context to the person 's past behavior or performance,Background,T8P7HT8E
"To understand how exposure to an unknown individual 's activity history influences attitudes and behaviors,",Purpose,T8P7HT8E
"we conducted an online experiment on Mechanical Turk varying the content, quality, and presentation of information about another Turker 's work history",Method,T8P7HT8E
"Surprisingly, negative work history did not lead to negative outcomes, but in contrast, a positive work history led to positive initial impressions that persisted in the face of contrary information",Findings,T8P7HT8E
"When personalities clash, teams operate less effectively",Background,T9IJMSRB
Personality differences affect face-to-face collaboration and may lower trust in virtual teams,Background,T9IJMSRB
"For relatively short-lived assignments, like those of online crowdsourcing, personality matching could provide a simple, scalable strategy for effective team formation",Purpose,T9IJMSRB
"However, it is not clear how ( or if ) personality differences affect teamwork in this novel context where the workforce is more transient and diverse",Purpose,T9IJMSRB
This study examines how personality compatibility in crowd teams affects performance and individual perceptions,Purpose,T9IJMSRB
"Using the DISC personality test, we composed 14 five-person teams ( N=70 ) with either a harmonious coverage of personalities ( balanced ) or a surplus of leader-type personalities ( imbalanced )",Method,T9IJMSRB
Results show that balancing for personality leads to significantly better performance on a collaborative task,Findings,T9IJMSRB
Balanced teams exhibited less conflict and their members reported higher levels of satisfaction and acceptance,Findings,T9IJMSRB
We present the first formal study of crowdworkers who have disabilities,Purpose,UQ4WC79E
via in-depth open-ended interviews of 17 people ( disabled crowdworkers and job coaches for people with disabilities ) and a survey of 631 adults with disabilities,Method,UQ4WC79E
"Our findings establish that people with a variety of disabilities currently participate in the crowd labor marketplace, despite challenges such as crowdsourcing workflow designs that inadvertently prohibit participation by, and may negatively affect the worker reputations of, people with disabilities",Findings,UQ4WC79E
"Despite such challenges, we find that crowdwork potentially offers different opportunities for people with disabilities relative to the normative office environment, such as job flexibility and lack of a need to rely on public transit",Findings,UQ4WC79E
"Increasingly, the advice people receive on the Internet is socially transparent in the sense that it displays contextual information about the advice-givers or their actions",Background,VM7EP4IA
We hypothesize that activity transparency -seeing an advice giver 's process while creating his or her recommendations - will increase advice taking,Purpose,VM7EP4IA
We report three experiments,Method,VM7EP4IA
testing the effect of activity transparency on taking mediocre advice,Purpose,VM7EP4IA
We found that the presence of a web history increased the likelihood of following a financial advisor 's advice and reduced participant earnings ( Exp,Findings,VM7EP4IA
"1 ) , especially when the web history implied greater task focus ( Exp",Findings,VM7EP4IA
"2, 3 )",Findings,VM7EP4IA
Social networking sites ( SNSs ) offer users a platform to build and maintain social connections,Background,XGBBFQWX
"Understanding when people feel comfortable sharing information about themselves on SNSs is critical to a good user experience, because self-disclosure helps maintain friendships and increase relationship closeness",Background,XGBBFQWX
This observational research develops a machine learning model to measure self-disclosure in SNSs and uses it to understand the contexts where it is higher or lower,Purpose,XGBBFQWX
"Features include emotional valence, social distance between the poster and people mentioned in the post, the language similarity between the post and the community and post topic",Mechanism,XGBBFQWX
"To validate the model and advance our understanding about online self-disclosure,",Purpose,XGBBFQWX
"we applied it to de-identified, aggregated status updates from Facebook users",Method,XGBBFQWX
Participatory sensing systems ( PSS ) require frequent injection of information that has a short shelf-life,Background,XSJ9KCBQ
The use of crowds to gather information for PSS is therefore particularly challenging,Background,XSJ9KCBQ
"In this study, we explore the impact of two policies on user contributions",Purpose,XSJ9KCBQ
A quid-pro-quo policy exchanges contributions from users for access to critical information in the system,Purpose,XSJ9KCBQ
A request policy simply reminds the user that information is needed to make the system function well,Purpose,XSJ9KCBQ
Prior research has shown that request for help in crowdsourced system is an effective mechanism to increase contributions,Background,XSJ9KCBQ
"During a large-scale experimental study within a publicly deployed, crowdsourced, transit information system, we analyzed metrics associated with frequency of contribution and commitment to long-term use over a 10-month period",Method,XSJ9KCBQ
"Our results confirmed that quid-pro-quo led to more contribution, but at a cost of faster departure from the study",Findings,XSJ9KCBQ
"When a participant was simply requested to contribute, but could still access community-generated data if they ignored a request, was largely ineffective and was statistically similar to the control condition where no request for contribution occurred",Findings,XSJ9KCBQ
Expert feedback is valuable but hard to obtain for many designers,Background,Z56T9MF4
"Online crowds can provide fast and affordable feedback, but workers may lack relevant domain knowledge and experience",Purpose,Z56T9MF4
Can expert rubrics address this issue and help novices provide expert-level feedback ?,Purpose,Z56T9MF4
"To evaluate this, we conducted an experiment with a 2x2 factorial design",Method,Z56T9MF4
"Student designers received feedback on a visual design from both experts and novices, who produced feedback using either an expert rubric or no rubric",Method,Z56T9MF4
We found that rubrics helped novice workers provide feedback that was rated nearly as valuable as expert feedback,Findings,Z56T9MF4
A follow-up analysis on writing style,Method,Z56T9MF4
"showed that student designers found feedback most helpful when it was emotionally positive and specific, and that a rubric increased the occurrence of these characteristics in feedback",Findings,Z56T9MF4
"The analysis also found that expertise correlated with longer critiques, but not the other favorable characteristics",Findings,Z56T9MF4

A novel method of using task fingerprinting,Mechanism,msa_1019651698
"to predict outcome measures such quality , errors , and the likelihood of cheating , particularly as applied to crowd sourced tasks",Purpose,msa_1019651698
The technique focuses on the way workers work rather than the products they produce,Mechanism,msa_1019651698
The technique captures behavioral traces from online crowd workers and uses them to build predictive models of task performance,Mechanism,msa_1019651698

Fast Fourier transform algorithms on large data sets achieve poor performance on various platforms because of the inefficient strided memory access patterns,Background,msa_1046360519
These inefficient access patterns need to be reshaped to achieve high performance implementations,Purpose,msa_1046360519
In this paper,Mechanism,msa_1046360519

Languages for music audio processing typically offer a large assortment of unit generators,Background,msa_105909713
"There is great duplication among different language implementations , as each language must implement many of the same ( or nearly the same ) unit generators",Background,msa_105909713
Csound has a large library of unit generators and could be a useful source of reusable unit generators for other languages or for direct use in applications,Purpose,msa_105909713
"In this study , we consider how Csound unit generators can be exposed to direct access by other audio processing languages",Purpose,msa_105909713
"Using Aura as an example , we modified Csound to allow efficient , dynamic allocation of individual unit generators without using the Csound compiler or writing Csound instruments",Mechanism,msa_105909713
We then extended Aura using automatic code generation so that Csound unit generators can be accessed in the normal way from within Aura,Mechanism,msa_105909713

"After comparing interview invitations for a Muslim versus a Christian candidate , and a gay versus a straight candidate ,",Method,msa_1119948448
"we find no difference in callback rates for the gay candidate compared to the straight candidate , but a 13 % lower callback rate for the Muslim candidate compared to the Christian candidate",Findings,msa_1119948448
"While the difference is not significant at the national level , it exhibits significant and robust heterogeneity in bias at the local level , compatible with existing theories of discrimination",Findings,msa_1119948448
"In particular , employers in Republican areas exhibit significant bias both against the Muslim candidate , and in favor of the Christian candidate",Findings,msa_1119948448

Simultaneously reverse engineering a collection of condition-specific gene networks from gene expression microarray data to uncover dynamic mechanisms is a key challenge in systems biology,Background,msa_114893815
"However , existing methods for this task are very sensitive to variations in the size of the microarray samples across different biological conditions ( which we term sample size heterogeneity in network reconstruction ) , and can potentially produce misleading results that can lead to incorrect biological interpretation",Purpose,msa_114893815

"Just like microarray measurements across conditions must undergo proper normalization on their magnitudes before entering subsequent analysis , we argue that networks across conditions also need to be normalized on their density when they are constructed , and we provide an algorithm that allows such normalization to be facilitated while estimating the networks",Mechanism,msa_114893815
We show the quantitative advantages of our approach,Findings,msa_114893815
on synthetic and real data,Method,msa_114893815
Our analysis of a hematopoietic stem cell dataset,Method,msa_114893815
We study the envy-free allocation of indivisible goods between two players,Purpose,msa_1158186897
Our novel setting includes an option to sell each good for a fraction of the minimum value any player has for the good,Mechanism,msa_1158186897
To rigorously quantify the efficiency gain from selling,Purpose,msa_1158186897
", we reason about the price of envy-freeness of allocations of sellable goods -- the ratio between the maximum social welfare and the social welfare of the best envy-free allocation",Mechanism,msa_1158186897
Some crowdsourcing platforms ask workers to express their opinions by approving a set of k good alternatives,Background,msa_1170623329
"It seems that the only reasonable way to aggregate these k-approval votes is the approval voting rule , which simply counts the number of times each alternative was approved",Purpose,msa_1170623329
We challenge this assertion,Purpose,msa_1170623329
"by proposing a probabilistic framework of noisy voting , and asking whether approval voting yields an alternative that is most likely to be the best alternative , given k-approval votes",Mechanism,msa_1170623329
"While the answer is generally positive , our theoretical and empirical",Method,msa_1170623329
Personal photos are enjoying explosive growth with the popularity of photo-taking devices and social media,Background,msa_1172683934
"The vast amount of online photos largely exhibit users ' interests , emotion and opinions",Background,msa_1172683934
"Mining user interests from personal photos can boost a number of utilities , such as advertising , interest based community detection and photo recommendation",Purpose,msa_1172683934
"In this paper , we study the problem of user interests mining from personal photos",Purpose,msa_1172683934
We propose a User Image Latent Space Model,Mechanism,msa_1172683934
to jointly model user interests and image contents,Purpose,msa_1172683934
User interests are modeled as latent factors and each user is assumed to have a distribution over them,Mechanism,msa_1172683934
"By inferring the latent factors and users ' distributions , we can discover what the users are interested in",Mechanism,msa_1172683934
"We model image contents with a four-level hierarchical structure where the layers correspond to themes , semantic regions , visual words and pixels respectively",Mechanism,msa_1172683934
Users ' latent interests are embedded in the theme layer,Mechanism,msa_1172683934
"Given image contents , users ' interests can be discovered by doing posterior inference",Mechanism,msa_1172683934
We use variational inference to approximate the posteriors of latent variables and learn model parameters,Mechanism,msa_1172683934
Experiments on 180K Flickr photos,Method,msa_1172683934
We introduce the simultaneous model,Mechanism,msa_1174549238
"for cake cutting ( the fair allocation of a divisible good ) , in which agents simultaneously send messages containing a sketch of their preferences over the cake",Purpose,msa_1174549238
"Motivated by applications to crowdsourcing ,",Background,msa_1181125918
we study voting rules that output a correct ranking of alternatives by quality from a large collection of noisy input rankings,Purpose,msa_1181125918
"We seek voting rules that are supremely robust to noise , in the sense of being correct in the face of any `` reasonable '' type of noise",Purpose,msa_1181125918
Classic social choice theory assumes that votes are independent ( but possibly conditioned on an underlying objective ground truth ),Background,msa_1185823071
"This assumption is unrealistic in settings where the voters are connected via an underlying social network structure , as social interactions lead to correlated votes",Purpose,msa_1185823071
We establish a general framework -- based on random utility theory --,Mechanism,msa_1185823071
for ranked voting,Purpose,msa_1185823071
"on a social network with arbitrarily many alternatives ( in contrast to previous work , which is restricted to two alternatives )",Mechanism,msa_1185823071
"We identify a family of voting rules which , without knowledge of the social network structure , are guaranteed",Mechanism,msa_1185823071
to recover the ground truth,Purpose,msa_1185823071
Limited lookahead has been studied for decades in perfect-information games,Background,msa_1190832478
This paper initiates a new direction via two simultaneous deviation points : generalization to imperfect-information games and a game-theoretic approach,Purpose,msa_1190832478
"The question of how one should act when facing an opponent whose lookahead is limited is studied along multiple axes : lookahead depth , whether the opponent ( s ) , too , have imperfect information , and how they break ties",Purpose,msa_1190832478
"We characterize the hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium or an optimal commitment strategy for either player , showing that in some of these variations the problem can be solved in polynomial time while in others it is PPAD-hard or NP-hard",Mechanism,msa_1190832478
We proceed to design algorithms,Mechanism,msa_1190832478
for computing optimal commitment strategies,Purpose,msa_1190832478
"for when the opponent breaks ties 1 ) favorably , 2 ) according to a fixed rule , or 3 ) adversarially",Mechanism,msa_1190832478
The impact of limited lookahead is then investigated experimentally,Method,msa_1190832478
"The limited-lookahead player often obtains the value of the game if she knows the expected values of nodes in the game tree for some equilibrium , but we prove this is not sufficient in general",Findings,msa_1190832478
"Finally , we study the impact of noise in those estimates and different lookahead depths",Method,msa_1190832478
We present an efficient algorithm,Mechanism,msa_1193543942
for solving a linear system arising from the 1-Laplacian corresponding to a collapsible simplicial complex with a known collapsing sequence,Purpose,msa_1193543942
"We study the paradigmatic fair division problem of fairly allocating a divisible good among agents with heterogeneous preferences , commonly known as cake cutting",Method,msa_1201606221
Classic cake cutting protocols are susceptible to manipulation,Purpose,msa_1201606221
Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness ? To address this question,Purpose,msa_1201606221
"we adopt a novel algorithmic approach , proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model",Mechanism,msa_1201606221
This disclosure relates to a three-dimensional ( 3D ) integrated circuit ( 3DIC ) memory chip including computational logic-in-memory ( LiM ),Mechanism,msa_1205012267
for performing accelerated data processing,Purpose,msa_1205012267
An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user 's password can mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses,Background,msa_1237159827
This offline attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password,Background,msa_1237159827
Key-stretching techniques like hash iteration and memory hard functions have been proposed to mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify,Background,msa_1237159827
"However , these techniques also increase costs for a legitimate authentication server",Purpose,msa_1237159827
We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model,Mechanism,msa_1237159827
which captures the essential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline attacker,Purpose,msa_1237159827
"In the game the defender first commits to a key-stretching mechanism , and the offline attacker responds in a manner that optimizes his utility ( expected reward minus expected guessing costs )",Mechanism,msa_1237159827
"We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash ( CASH ) , a randomized key-stretching mechanism",Mechanism,msa_1237159827
that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be cracked by a rational offline attacker,Purpose,msa_1237159827
without increasing amortized authentication costs for the legitimate authentication server,Mechanism,msa_1237159827
"CASH is motivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will typically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password , while an offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses",Mechanism,msa_1237159827
By using randomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a correct password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an incorrect password,Mechanism,msa_1237159827
Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the quality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the fraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack,Mechanism,msa_1237159827
We provide an efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the defender,Mechanism,msa_1237159827
"Finally , we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale password frequency datasets",Method,msa_1237159827

"A key challenge in solving extensive-form games is dealing with large , or even infinite , action spaces",Background,msa_1439783155
"In games of imperfect information , the leading approach is to find a Nash equilibrium in a smaller abstract version of the game that includes only a few actions at each decision point , and then map the solution back to the original game",Background,msa_1439783155
"However , it is difficult to know which actions should be included in the abstraction without first solving the game , and it is infeasible to solve the game without first abstracting it",Purpose,msa_1439783155
We introduce a method that combines abstraction with equilibrium finding by enabling actions to be added to the abstraction at run time,Mechanism,msa_1439783155
"This allows an agent to begin learning with a coarse abstraction , and then to strategically insert actions at points that the strategy computed in the current abstraction deems important",Mechanism,msa_1439783155
The algorithm can quickly add actions to the abstraction while provably not having to restart the equilibrium finding,Mechanism,msa_1439783155
It enables anytime convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the full game even in infinite games,Mechanism,msa_1439783155

"Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range or hierarchical dependency among many variables , and have been widely applied in different areas of computer science and statistics",Background,msa_1488098960
"However , existing methods for parameter estimation , inference , and structure learning mainly rely on the Gaussian or discrete assumptions , which are restrictive under many applications",Purpose,msa_1488098960
"In this paper , we propose new nonparametric methods based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions",Mechanism,msa_1488098960

"One common problem plaguing crowdsourcing tasks is tuning the set of worker responses : Depending on task requirements , requesters may want a large set of rich and varied worker responses ( typically in subjective evaluation tasks ) or a more convergent response-set ( typically for more objective tasks such as fact-checking )",Purpose,msa_1488442210
"This problem is especially salient in tasks that combine workers responses to present a single output : Divergence in these settings could either add richness and complexity to the unified answer , or noise",Purpose,msa_1488442210

Active learning has shown to reduce the number of exper- iments needed to obtain high-confidence drug-target predictions,Background,msa_1491410911
"How- ever , in order to actually save experiments using active learning , it is crucial to have a method to evaluate the quality of the current pre- diction and decide when to stop the experimentation process",Background,msa_1491410911

"While audio classification is widely used in other research areas such as music information retrieval and bioacoustics , its application to vehicle sounds is rare",Purpose,msa_1496124465
"Therefore , we investigate predicting the state of a vehicle using audio features in a classification task",Mechanism,msa_1496124465

Training large machine learning ( ML ) models with many variables or parameters can take a long time if one employs sequential procedures even with stochastic updates,Background,msa_1497213868
"A natural solution is to turn to distributed computing on a cluster ; however , naive , unstructured parallelization of ML algorithms does not usually lead to a proportional speedup and can even result in divergence , because dependencies between model elements can attenuate the computational gains from parallelization and compromise correctness of inference",Purpose,msa_1497213868
"Recent efforts toward this issue have benefited from exploiting the static , a priori block structures residing in ML algorithms",Purpose,msa_1497213868
"In this paper , we take this path further",Purpose,msa_1497213868
"by exploring the dynamic block structures and workloads therein present during ML program execution , which offers new opportunities for improving convergence , correctness , and load balancing in distributed ML",Method,msa_1497213868

"By carefully reordering the operations , and exploiting the sparsity of real world tensors , HaTen2 dramatically reduces the intermediate data , and the number of jobs",Mechanism,msa_1574504252

Building information models ( BIMs ) provide opportunities to serve as an information repository to store and deliver as-built information,Background,msa_1581272063
"Since a building is not always constructed exactly as the design information specifies , there will be discrepancies between a BIM created in the design phase ( called as-designed BIM ) and the as-built conditions",Background,msa_1581272063
Point clouds captured by laser scans can be used as a reference to update an as-designed BIM into an as-built BIM ( i,Background,msa_1581272063
", the BIM that captures the as-built information )",Background,msa_1581272063
Occlusions and construction progress prevent a laser scan performed at a single point in time to capture a complete view of building components,Background,msa_1581272063
Progressively scanning a building during the construction phase and combining the progressively captured point cloud data together can provide the geometric information missing in the point cloud data captured previously,Background,msa_1581272063
"However , combining all point cloud data will result in large file sizes and might not always guarantee additional building component information",Purpose,msa_1581272063
This paper provides the details of an approach developed,Mechanism,msa_1581272063
"Both SAT and # SAT can represent difficult problems in seemingly dissimilar areas such as planning , verification , and probabilistic inference",Background,msa_1582388266
"Here , we examine an expressive new language , # SAT , that generalizes both of these languages",Purpose,msa_1582388266
"# SAT problems require counting the number of satisfiable formulas in a concisely-describable set of existentially-quantified , propositional formulas",Background,msa_1582388266
"We characterize the expressiveness and worst-case difficulty of # SAT by proving it is complete for the complexity class # PNP [ 1 ] , and relating this class to more familiar complexity classes",Mechanism,msa_1582388266
We also experiment with three new general-purpose # SAT solvers on a battery of problem distributions including a simple logistics domain,Method,msa_1582388266
Classic cake cutting protocols -- which fairly allocate a divisible good among agents with heterogeneous preferences -- are susceptible to manipulation,Background,msa_1583010304
Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness ? To answer this question,Purpose,msa_1583010304
"we adopt a novel algorithmic approach , proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model",Mechanism,msa_1583010304
"Specifically , we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose ( GCC ) protocols -- which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols -- is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria",Mechanism,msa_1583010304
"Moreover , we observe that the ( approximate ) equilibria of proportional protocols -- which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake -- must be ( approximately ) proportional , and design a GCC protocol where all Nash equilibrium outcomes satisfy the stronger fairness notion of envy-freeness",Mechanism,msa_1583010304
"Finally , we show that under an obliviousness restriction , which still allows the computation of approximately envy-free allocations ,",Method,msa_1583010304
The paper introduces a method by which,Mechanism,msa_1585226355
to design the topology of a distributed sensor network that is minimal with respect to a communication cost function,Purpose,msa_1585226355
"In the scenario considered , sensor nodes communicate with each other within a graph structure to update their data according to linear dynamics using neighbor node data",Mechanism,msa_1585226355
A subset of sensors can also report their state to a central location,Mechanism,msa_1585226355
One physical interpretation of this situation would be a set of spatially distributed wireless sensors which can communicate with other sensors within range to update data and can possibly connect to a network backbone,Mechanism,msa_1585226355
The costs would then be related to transmission energy,Mechanism,msa_1585226355
"The objective is to recover the vector of initial sensor measurements from the backbone outputs over time , which requires that the dynamics of the overall networked system be observable",Mechanism,msa_1585226355
The topology of the network is then determined by the nonzero elements of the optimal observable dynamics,Mechanism,msa_1585226355
"The following text contributes an efficient algorithm for designing the optimal observable dynamics and the network topology for a given set of sensors and cost function ,",Mechanism,msa_1585226355
The Bayesian paradigm has provided a useful conceptual theory for understanding perceptual computation in the brain,Background,msa_1595026169
"While the detailed neural mechanisms of Bayesian inference are not fully understood , recent computational and neurophysiological works have illuminated the underlying computational principles and representational architecture",Background,msa_1595026169
"The fundamental insights are that the visual system is organized as a modular hierarchy to encode an internal model of the world , and that perception is realized by statistical inference based on such internal model",Background,msa_1595026169
"In this paper , we will discuss and analyze the varieties of representational schemes of these internal models and how they might be used to perform learning and inference",Purpose,msa_1595026169
We will argue for a unified theoretical framework,Mechanism,msa_1595026169
"In this paper , we present the design and evaluation of a platform",Mechanism,msa_1595208394
that can be used for time synchronization and indoor positioning of mobile devices,Purpose,msa_1595208394
The platform uses the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival ( TDOA ) of multiple ultrasonic chirps broadcast from a network of beacons placed throughout the environment to find an initial location as well as synchronize a receivers clock with the infrastructure,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
These chirps encode identification data and ranging information that can be used to compute the receivers location,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
"Once the clocks have been synchronized , the system can continue performing localization directly using Time-of-Flight ( TOF ) ranging as opposed to TDOA",Mechanism,msa_1595208394
This provides similar position accuracy with fewer beacons ( for tens of minutes ) until the mobile device clock drifts enough that a TDOA signal is once again required,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
Our hardware platform uses RF-based time synchronization to distribute clock synchronization from a subset of infrastructure beacons connected to a GPS source,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
Mobile devices use a novel time synchronization technique leverages the continuously free-running audio sampling subsystem of a smartphone to synchronize with global time,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
"Once synchronized , each device can determine an accurate proximity from as little as one beacon using TOF measurements",Mechanism,msa_1595208394
This significantly decreases the number of beacons required to cover an indoor space and improves performance in the face of obstructions,Mechanism,msa_1595208394
We show through experiments,Method,msa_1595208394
Document clustering and topic modeling are two closely related tasks which can mutually benefit each other,Background,msa_1598801360
Topic modeling can project documents into a topic space which facilitates effective document clustering,Background,msa_1598801360
Cluster labels discovered by document clustering can be incorporated into topic models to extract local topics specific to each cluster and global topics shared by all clusters,Background,msa_1598801360
"In this paper , we propose a multi-grain clustering topic model ( MGCTM ) which integrates document clustering and topic modeling",Mechanism,msa_1598801360
into a unified framework and jointly performs the two tasks to achieve the overall best performance,Purpose,msa_1598801360
Our model tightly couples two components : a mixture component used for discovering latent groups in document collection and a topic model component used for mining multi-grain topics including local topics specific to each cluster and global topics shared across clusters,Mechanism,msa_1598801360
We employ variational inference to approximate the posterior of hidden variables and learn model parameters,Mechanism,msa_1598801360
Experiments on two datasets,Method,msa_1598801360
"In the United States , over three billion dollars are spent due to office equipment being left on when not in use during the weekend and at night",Background,msa_1599060194
There is very little incentive for office workers to save energy because utility bills are not directly their responsibility,Purpose,msa_1599060194
Our goal is to find ways to reduce the negative impact of this pervasive phenomenon,Purpose,msa_1599060194
by applying persuasive technologies,Mechanism,msa_1599060194
to create awareness and encourage office workers towards more environmentally sustainable behavior,Purpose,msa_1599060194
"To this end , we conducted a literature review to investigate the persuasive methods appropriate to the field of building controls",Method,msa_1599060194
We then proceeded to develop `` dashboard-controllers '',Mechanism,msa_1599060194
that enable office workers to control energy-using components,Purpose,msa_1599060194

"Differential game logic ( dG L ) is a logic for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid games , i",Background,msa_1602537577
", games that combine discrete , continuous , and adversarial dynamics",Background,msa_1602537577
"Unlike hybrid systems , hybrid games allow choices in the system dynamics to be resolved adversarially by different players with different objectives",Background,msa_1602537577
The logic dG L can be used,Mechanism,msa_1602537577
"to study the existence of winning strategies for such hybrid games ,",Purpose,msa_1602537577
", ways of resolving the players choices in some way so that he wins by achieving his objective for all choices of the opponent",Mechanism,msa_1602537577
"Hybrid games are determined , i",Mechanism,msa_1602537577
", from each state , one player has a winning strategy , yet computing their winning regions may take transfinitely many steps",Mechanism,msa_1602537577
"The logic dG L , nevertheless , has a sound and complete axiomatization relative to any expressive logic",Mechanism,msa_1602537577
Separating axioms are identified that distinguish hybrid games from hybrid systems,Mechanism,msa_1602537577
"Finally , dG L is proved to be strictly more expressive than the corresponding logic of hybrid systems",Findings,msa_1602537577
"In this paper , we examine the emerging copycat issue in the mobile apps market",Purpose,msa_160458139
"Using machine learning techniques on large-scale unstructured data ,",Mechanism,msa_160458139
we detect two types of copycats ( deceptive and non-deceptive ),Findings,msa_160458139
"from 10,100 action game apps from iOS App Store over five years",Method,msa_160458139
"Based on our detected copycats , we model the key drivers of mobile app copycats as well as their major impacts",Mechanism,msa_160458139
"Protocols for tasks such as authentication , electronic voting , and secure multiparty computation ensure desirable security properties if agents follow their prescribed programs",Background,msa_1605885448
"However , if some agents deviate from their prescribed programs and a security property is violated , it is important to hold agents accountable by determining which deviations actually caused the violation",Purpose,msa_1605885448
"Motivated by these applications , we initiate a formal study of program actions as actual causes",Purpose,msa_1605885448
"Specifically , we define in an interacting program model what it means for a set of program actions to be an actual cause of a violation",Mechanism,msa_1605885448
We present a sound technique,Mechanism,msa_1605885448
for establishing program actions as actual causes,Purpose,msa_1605885448
We demonstrate the value of this formalism in two ways,Mechanism,msa_1605885448
"First , we prove that violations of a specific class of safety properties always have an actual cause",Findings,msa_1605885448
"Thus , our definition applies to relevant security properties",Background,msa_1605885448
"Privacy has become a significant concern in modern society as personal information about individuals is increasingly collected , used , and shared , often using digital technologies , by a wide range of organizations",Background,msa_1608104707

This article provides an overview of a body of work on formalizing and enforcing privacy policies,Purpose,msa_1608104707
We formalize privacy policies that prescribe and proscribe flows of personal information as well as those that place restrictions on the purposes for which a governed entity may use personal information,Mechanism,msa_1608104707
"Recognizing that traditional preventive access control and information flow control mechanisms are inadequate for enforcing such privacy policies , we develop principled accountability mechanisms that seek to encourage policy-compliant behavior by detecting policy violations , assigning blame , and punishing violators",Mechanism,msa_1608104707

"When building large-scale machine learning ( ML ) programs , such as massive topic models or deep neural networks with up to trillions of parameters and training examples , one usually assumes that such massive tasks can only be attempted with industrial-sized clusters with thousands of nodes , which are out of reach for most practitioners and academic researchers",Purpose,msa_1609010894
"We consider this challenge in the context of topic modeling on web-scale corpora ,",Purpose,msa_1609010894

"Our major contributions include : 1 ) a new , highly-efficient O ( 1 ) Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm , whose running cost is ( surprisingly ) agnostic of model size , and empirically converges nearly an order of magnitude more quickly than current state-of-the-art Gibbs samplers ; 2 ) a model-scheduling scheme to handle the big model challenge , where each worker machine schedules the fetch/use of sub-models as needed , resulting in a frugal use of limited memory capacity and network bandwidth ; 3 ) a differential data-structure for model storage , which uses separate data structures for high- and low-frequency words to allow extremely large models to fit in memory , while maintaining high inference speed",Mechanism,msa_1609010894

"In distributed ML applications , shared parameters are usually replicated among computing nodes to minimize network overhead",Background,msa_1619486754
"Therefore , proper consistency model must be carefully chosen to ensure algorithm 's correctness and provide high throughput",Background,msa_1619486754
Existing consistency models used in general-purpose databases and modern distributed ML systems are either too loose to guarantee correctness of the ML algorithms or too strict and thus fail to fully exploit the computing power of the underlying distributed system,Background,msa_1619486754
Many ML algorithms fall into the category of \emph { iterative convergent algorithms } which start from a randomly chosen initial point and converge to optima by repeating iteratively a set of procedures,Background,msa_1619486754
We 've found that many such algorithms are to a bounded amount of inconsistency and still converge correctly,Purpose,msa_1619486754
This property allows distributed ML to relax strict consistency models to improve system performance while theoretically guarantees algorithmic correctness,Purpose,msa_1619486754
"In this paper , we present several relaxed consistency models",Mechanism,msa_1619486754
for asynchronous parallel computation and,Purpose,msa_1619486754
theoretically prove their algorithmic correctness,Method,msa_1619486754
The proposed consistency models are implemented in a distributed parameter server,Mechanism,msa_1619486754
Modern organizations ( e,Background,msa_1636310606
", hospitals , social networks , government agencies ) rely heavily on audit to detect and punish insiders who inappropriately access and disclose confidential information",Background,msa_1636310606
"Recent work on audit games models the strategic interaction between an auditor with a single audit resource and auditees as a Stackelberg game , augmenting associated well-studied security games with a configurable punishment parameter",Purpose,msa_1636310606
We significantly generalize this audit game model,Mechanism,msa_1636310606
to account for multiple audit resources,Purpose,msa_1636310606
"where each resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations , thus",Mechanism,msa_1636310606
enabling application to practical auditing scenarios,Purpose,msa_1636310606
We provide an FPTAS that computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex optimization problem,Mechanism,msa_1636310606
The main technical novelty is in the design and correctness proof of an optimization transformation that enables the construction of this FPTAS,Mechanism,msa_1636310606
"In addition , we experimentally demonstrate",Method,msa_1636310606
"To partly address people 's concerns over web tracking , Google has created the Ad Settings webpage to provide information about and some choice over the profiles Google creates on users",Background,msa_1648303880
"We present AdFisher , an automated tool",Mechanism,msa_1648303880
"that explores how user behaviors , Google 's ads , and Ad Settings interact",Purpose,msa_1648303880
AdFisher can run browser-based experiments and analyze data using machine learning and significance tests,Mechanism,msa_1648303880
Our tool uses a rigorous experimental design and statistical analysis to ensure the statistical soundness of our results,Mechanism,msa_1648303880
"We use AdFisher to find that the Ad Settings was opaque about some features of a user 's profile , that it does provide some choice on ads , and that these choices can lead to seemingly discriminatory ads",Mechanism,msa_1648303880
"In particular , we found that visiting webpages associated with substance abuse changed the ads shown but not the settings page",Findings,msa_1648303880
We also found that setting the gender to female resulted in getting fewer instances of an ad related to high paying jobs than setting it to male,Findings,msa_1648303880
"We can not determine who caused these findings due to our limited visibility into the ad ecosystem , which includes Google , advertisers , websites , and users",Findings,msa_1648303880
We introduce quantitative usability and security models,Mechanism,msa_1652517948
to guide the design of password management schemes systematic strate- gies to help users create and remember multiple passwords,Purpose,msa_1652517948
In the same way that security proofs in cryptography are based on complexity- theoretic assumptions ( e,Mechanism,msa_1652517948
", hardness of factoring and discrete loga- rithm ) , we quantify usability by introducing usability assumptions",Mechanism,msa_1652517948
"I n particular , password management relies on assumptions about human memory , e",Mechanism,msa_1652517948
", that a user who follows a particular rehearsal schedule will successfully maintain the corresponding memory",Mechanism,msa_1652517948
These assumptions are informed by research in cognitive science and can be tested empirically,Mechanism,msa_1652517948
"Given rehearsal requirements and a user 's visitation schedule for each account , we use the total number of extra rehearsals that the user would have to do to remember all of his passwords as a measure of the usability of the password scheme",Mechanism,msa_1652517948
Our usability model leads us to a key observa- tion :,Mechanism,msa_1652517948
"password reuse benefits users not only by reducing the number of passwords that the user has to memorize , but more importantly by in- creasing the natural rehearsal rate for each password",Findings,msa_1652517948
We also present a security model which accounts,Mechanism,msa_1652517948
for the complexity of password man- agement,Purpose,msa_1652517948
"with multiple accounts and associated threats , including online , offline , and plaintext password leak attacks",Mechanism,msa_1652517948
Observing that current pass- word management schemes are either insecure or unusable,Purpose,msa_1652517948
Many important applications fall into the broad class of iterative convergent algorithms,Background,msa_1652793671
Parallel implementations of these algorithms are naturally expressed using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel ( BSP ) model of computation,Background,msa_1652793671
"However , implementations using BSP are plagued by the straggler problem , where every transient slowdown of any given thread can delay all other threads",Purpose,msa_1652793671
This paper presents the Stale Synchronous Parallel ( SSP ) model as a generalization of BSP,Mechanism,msa_1652793671
"that preserves many of its advantages , while avoiding the straggler problem",Purpose,msa_1652793671
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ( DCIS ) is a precursor lesion of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ( IDC ) of the breast,Background,msa_1654482962
Investigating its temporal progression could provide fundamental new insights for the development of better diagnostic tools to predict which cases of DCIS will progress to IDC,Background,msa_1654482962
We investigate the problem of reconstructing a plausible progression from single-cell sampled data of an individual with synchronous DCIS and IDC,Purpose,msa_1654482962
"Specifically , by using a number of assumptions derived from the observation of cellular atypia occurring in IDC , we design a possible predictive model using integer linear programming ( ILP )",Mechanism,msa_1654482962
Computational experiments carried out on a preexisting data set of 13 patients with simultaneous DCIS and IDC,Method,msa_1654482962
show that the corresponding predicted progression models are classifiable into categories having specific evolutionary characteristics,Findings,msa_1654482962
"A variety of problems in computing , service , and manufacturing systems can be modeled via infinite repeating Markov chains with an infinite number of levels and a finite number of phases",Background,msa_1666218092
"Many such chains are quasi-birth-death processes with transitions that are skip-free in level , in that one can only transition between consecutive levels , and unidirectional in phase , in that one can only transition from lower-numbered phases to higher-numbered phases",Purpose,msa_1666218092
"We present a procedure , which we call Clearing Analysis on Phases ( CAP ) ,",Mechanism,msa_1666218092
for determining the limiting probabilities of such Markov chains exactly,Purpose,msa_1666218092
"In this paper we consider strong Nash equilibria , in mixed strategies , for finite games",Purpose,msa_1667857601
Any strong Nash equilibrium outcome is Pareto efficient for each coalition,Background,msa_1667857601
"First , we analyze the two -- player setting",Method,msa_1667857601
"Our main result , in its simplest form , states that if a game has a strong Nash equilibrium with full support ( that is , both players randomize among all pure strategies ) , then the game is strictly competitive",Findings,msa_1667857601
In order to get our result,Purpose,msa_1667857601
"Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes such as image , textual , and multi-view feature vectors on nodes , rather than simple univariate nodal attributes",Background,msa_167498579
"The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data , neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied",Purpose,msa_167498579
"In this paper , we propose a new principled framework",Mechanism,msa_167498579
for estimating multi-attribute graphs,Purpose,msa_167498579
"Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature , our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features",Mechanism,msa_167498579
"Computationally , we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure",Mechanism,msa_167498579
"Theoretically , we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery",Mechanism,msa_167498579
Extensive simulation studies,Method,msa_167498579
"Proceedings : AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015 ; April 18-22 , 2015 ; Philadelphia , PA Intratumor heterogeneity has long been a confounding factor in interpreting cancer genomic data , but has also been useful in reconstructing progression processes based on variation between clonal populations in single tumors",Background,msa_1678667688
We previously developed a strategy of applying computational deconvolution algorithms to gene expression or DNA copy number data to reconstruct models of progression of cell populations from bulk tumor samples,Background,msa_1678667688
"Many tools have since been proposed for similar deconvolution analysis , but all are limited by the computational difficulty of unambiguously distinguishing small cell populations and variants from noise in genomic assays",Purpose,msa_1678667688
We present a novel approach,Mechanism,msa_1678667688
to infer tumor progression pathways from deconvolved genomic data,Purpose,msa_1678667688
"designed to leverage the fact that tumors that partition into subtypes with similar evolutionary trajectories would be expected to lead to a mathematical substructure in the genomic data , known as a simplicial complex , which can be modeled computationally",Mechanism,msa_1678667688
to better deconvolve cell populations across tumor types,Purpose,msa_1678667688
We have developed a computational pipeline,Mechanism,msa_1678667688
to perform tumor deconvolution,Purpose,msa_1678667688
while taking into consideration this kind of mathematical structure,Mechanism,msa_1678667688
"The pipeline clusters tumors to identify genetically distinct subgroups , fits mixture models to these subgroups , and uses overlap between them to infer a refined deconvolution of major cellular populations and possible pathways of progression between them",Mechanism,msa_1678667688
We apply our methods to a set of RNASeq data from the TCGA breast cancer data set and to synthetic data modeling distinct scenarios of tumor progression,Method,msa_1678667688
We first compare our methods on the synthetic data to our earlier work and to a comparative Gaussian mixture model,Method,msa_1678667688
All methods perform comparably on unstructured data but the new method substantially outperforms the others on data consistent with simple scenarios for tumor progression along multiple discrete subtypes,Findings,msa_1678667688
"The novel method , however , shows lower tolerance for noisy data than a Gaussian mixture model",Findings,msa_1678667688
Application to the TCGA RNASeq data,Method,msa_1678667688
"showed our method could partition tumors into discrete subcategories associated with HER2+ , ER/PR+ , and triple-negative status and could exploit the resulting substructure of the data to deconvolve tumor data and infer progression models reflecting partial sharing of progression states between subtypes",Findings,msa_1678667688
Gene enrichment analysis,Method,msa_1678667688
showed association of deconvolved cell populations with a variety of gene functional categories suggestive of distinct progression mechanisms of the subtypes,Findings,msa_1678667688

"Signals and datasets that arise in physical and engineering applications , as well as social , genetics , biomolecular , and many other domains , are becoming increasingly larger and more complex",Background,msa_1698699930
"In contrast to traditional time and image signals , data in these domains are supported by arbitrary graphs",Background,msa_1698699930
Signal processing on graphs extends concepts and techniques from traditional signal processing to data indexed by generic graphs,Background,msa_1698699930
"This paper studies the concepts of low and high frequencies on graphs , and low- , high- and band-pass graph signals and graph filters",Purpose,msa_1698699930
"In traditional signal processing , these concepts are easily defined because of a natural frequency ordering that has a physical interpretation",Background,msa_1698699930
"For signals residing on graphs , in general , there is no obvious frequency ordering",Background,msa_1698699930
We propose a definition of total variation,Mechanism,msa_1698699930
for graph signals,Purpose,msa_1698699930
"that naturally leads to a frequency ordering on graphs and defines low- , high- , and band-pass graph signals and filters",Mechanism,msa_1698699930
"Block tridiagonal matrices arise in applied mathematics , physics , and signal processing",Background,msa_1699271484
"Many applications require knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of block tridiagonal matrices , which can be prohibitively expensive for large matrix sizes",Background,msa_1699271484
"In this paper , we address the problem of the eigendecomposition of block tridiagonal matrices",Purpose,msa_1699271484
by studying a connection between their eigenvalues and zeros of appropriate matrix polynomials,Mechanism,msa_1699271484
"We use this connection with matrix polynomials to derive a closed-form expression for the eigenvectors of block tridiagonal matrices , which eliminates the need for their direct calculation and can lead to a faster calculation of eigenvalues",Mechanism,msa_1699271484
We also demonstrate with an example,Method,msa_1699271484
We aim to detect complex events in long Internet videos that may last for hours,Purpose,msa_1706000851
A major challenge in this setting is that only a few shots in a long video are relevant to the event of interest while others are irrelevant or even misleading,Purpose,msa_1706000851
"Instead of indifferently pooling the shots , we first define a novel notion of semantic saliency that assesses the relevance of each shot with the event of interest",Mechanism,msa_1706000851
We then prioritize the shots according to their saliency scores since shots that are semantically more salient are expected to contribute more to the final event detector,Mechanism,msa_1706000851
"Next , we propose a new isotonic regularizer that is able to exploit the semantic ordering information",Mechanism,msa_1706000851
The resulting nearly-isotonic SVM classifier exhibits higher discriminative power,Mechanism,msa_1706000851
"Computationally , we develop an efficient implementation using the proximal gradient algorithm , and we prove new , closed-form proximal steps",Mechanism,msa_1706000851
We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world video datasets,Method,msa_1706000851
We present faster algorithms,Mechanism,msa_1711138509
"for approximate maximum flow in undirected graphs with good separator structures ,",Purpose,msa_1711138509
"such as bounded genus , minor free , and geometric graphs",Mechanism,msa_1711138509
"Given such a graph with n vertices , m edges along with a recursive n-vertex separator structure , our algorithm finds an 1 -- e approximate maximum flow in time O ( m6/5poly ( e -- 1 ) ) , ignoring poly-logarithmic terms",Mechanism,msa_1711138509
Similar speedups are also achieved for separable graphs with larger size separators albeit with larger run times,Mechanism,msa_1711138509
These bounds also apply to image problems in two and three dimensions,Mechanism,msa_1711138509
"Key to our algorithm is an intermediate problem that we term grouped L2 flow , which exists between maximum flows and electrical flows",Mechanism,msa_1711138509
Our algorithm also makes use of spectral vertex sparsifiers in order to remove vertices while preserving the energy dissipation of electrical flows,Mechanism,msa_1711138509

The cake cutting problem models the fair division of a heterogeneous good between multiple agents,Background,msa_1729959974
Previous work assumes that each agent derives value only from its own piece,Background,msa_1729959974
"However , agents may also care about the pieces assigned to other agents ; such externalities naturally arise in fair division settings",Purpose,msa_1729959974

"to capture externalities , and generalize the classical fairness notions of proportionality and envyfreeness",Purpose,msa_1729959974
"If Alice has double the friends of Bob , will she also have dou- ble the phone-calls ( or wall-postings , or tweets ) ?",Purpose,msa_17409017

Kidney exchange provides a life-saving alternative to long waiting lists for patients in need of a new kidney,Background,msa_1775553015

we formally adapt a recently introduced measure of the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency -- -the price of fairness -- -to the standard kidney exchange model,Mechanism,msa_1775553015

"Abstract : Privacy policies in sectors as diverse as Web services , finance and healthcare often place restrictions on the purposes for which a governed entity may use personal information",Background,msa_179215925
"Thus , automated methods for enforcing privacy policies require a semantics of purpose restrictions to determine whether a governed agent used information for a purpose",Purpose,msa_179215925
We provide such a semantics,Purpose,msa_179215925
using a formalism based on planning,Mechanism,msa_179215925
"We model planning using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes ( POMDPs ) , which supports an explicit model of information",Mechanism,msa_179215925
We argue that information use is for a purpose if and only if the information is used while planning to optimize the satisfaction of that purpose under the POMDP model,Mechanism,msa_179215925
"We determine information use by simulating ignorance of the information prohibited by the purpose restriction , which we relate to noninterference",Mechanism,msa_179215925
We use this semantics to develop a sound audit algorithm,Mechanism,msa_179215925
"We present power low rank ensembles ( PLRE ) , a flexible framework",Mechanism,msa_1804883388
for n-gram language modeling,Purpose,msa_1804883388
where ensembles of low rank matrices and tensors are used to obtain smoothed probability estimates of words in context,Mechanism,msa_1804883388
"Our method can be understood as a generalization of ngram modeling to non-integer n , and includes standard techniques such as absolute discounting and Kneser-Ney smoothing as special cases",Mechanism,msa_1804883388
We find large deviations rates for consensus-based distributed inference for directed networks,Purpose,msa_1809903287
"When the topology is deterministic , we establish the large deviations principle and find exactly the corresponding rate function , equal at all nodes",Findings,msa_1809903287
We show that the dependence of the rate function on the stochastic weight matrix associated with the network is fully captured by its left eigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvalue,Findings,msa_1809903287
"Further , when the sensors observations are Gaussian , the rate function admits a closed-form expression",Findings,msa_1809903287
"Motivated by these observations , we formulate the optimal network design problem of",Mechanism,msa_1809903287
finding the left eigenvector that achieves the highest value of the rate function,Purpose,msa_1809903287
", for a given target accuracy",Mechanism,msa_1809903287
This eigenvector therefore minimizes the time that the inference algorithm needs to reach the desired accuracy,Mechanism,msa_1809903287
"For Gaussian observations ,",Method,msa_1809903287
"we show that the network design problem can be formulated as a semidefinite ( convex ) program , and hence can be solved efficiently",Findings,msa_1809903287
"When observations are identically distributed across agents ,",Method,msa_1809903287
the system exhibits an interesting property : the graph of the rate function always lies between the graphs of the rate function of an isolated node and the rate function of a fusion center that has access to all observations,Findings,msa_1809903287
"We prove that this fundamental property holds even when the topology and the associated system matrices change randomly over time , with arbitrary distribution",Findings,msa_1809903287
"Due to the generality of its assumptions , the latter result requires more subtle techniques than the standard large deviations tools ,",Mechanism,msa_1809903287
"In this paper , we explore how the contextual ambiguity of a search can affect a keyword 's performance",Purpose,msa_18143179
We propose,Mechanism,msa_18143179
an automatic way of categorizing keywords and examining keyword contextual ambiguity,Purpose,msa_18143179
based on topic models from machine learning and computational linguistics,Mechanism,msa_18143179
"We quantify the effect of contextual ambiguity on keyword click-through performance using a hierarchical Bayesian model ,",Mechanism,msa_18143179
"and validate our study using a novel dataset from a major search engine containing information on click activities for 12,790 keywords across multiple categories from over 4",Method,msa_18143179
6 million impressions,Method,msa_18143179
"We find that consumer click behaviors vary significantly across keywords , and keyword category and contextual ambiguity significantly affect such variation",Findings,msa_18143179
"Specifically , higher contextual ambiguity can lead to higher click-through rate ( CTR ) on top-positioned ads , but the CTR tends to decay faster with position",Findings,msa_18143179
We analyze the problem of regression when both input covariates and output responses are functions from a nonparametric function class,Purpose,msa_1814438592
"Function to function regression ( FFR ) covers a large range of interesting applications including timeseries prediction problems , and also more general tasks like studying a mapping between two separate types of distributions",Background,msa_1814438592
"However , previous nonparametric estimators for FFR type problems scale badly computationally with the number of input/output pairs in a data-set",Purpose,msa_1814438592
Given the complexity of a mapping between general functions it may be necessary to consider large datasets in order to achieve a low estimation risk,Purpose,msa_1814438592
"To address this issue ,",Purpose,msa_1814438592
"we develop a novel scalable nonparametric estimator , the Triple-Basis Estimator ( 3BE ) , which is capable of operating over data-sets with many instances",Mechanism,msa_1814438592
"To the best of our knowledge , the 3BE is the first nonparametric FFR estimator that can scale to massive data-sets",Mechanism,msa_1814438592
We analyze the 3BEs risk and derive an upperbound rate,Method,msa_1814438592
"Furthermore , we show an improvement of several orders of magnitude in terms of prediction speed and a reduction in error over previous estimators",Findings,msa_1814438592
An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them without relying on a fully trusted computer,Background,msa_1817409002
We propose several candidate authentication protocols,Mechanism,msa_1817409002
for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer,Purpose,msa_1817409002
-- - a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality,Mechanism,msa_1817409002
Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $ C_i\in [ n ] ^k $,Mechanism,msa_1817409002
The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $ \sigma : [ n ] \rightarrow\mathbb { Z } _d $ and authenticates by computing responses $ f ( \sigma ( C_i ) ) $ to a sequence of public challenges where $ f : \mathbb { Z } _d^k\rightarrow\mathbb { Z } _d $ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate,Mechanism,msa_1817409002
"We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $ m=\tilde { \Omega } ( n^ { s ( f ) } ) $ challenge-response pairs to recover $ \sigma $ , for a security parameter $ s ( f ) $ that depends on two key properties of $ f $",Mechanism,msa_1817409002
"To obtain our results , we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $ f $ and $ \sigma $",Mechanism,msa_1817409002
"Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $ f $ ( not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate ) , and generalize recent results of Feldman et al",Mechanism,msa_1817409002
"As an application , we propose a family of human computable password functions $ f_ { k_1 , k_2 } $ in which the user needs to perform $ 2k_1+2k_2+1 $ primitive operations ( e",Method,msa_1817409002
", adding two digits or remembering $ \sigma ( i ) $ ) , and we show that $ s ( f ) 0 \min\ { k_1+1 , ( k_2+1 ) /2\ } $",Method,msa_1817409002
We study security games with multiple defenders,Purpose,msa_1818018820
"To achieve maximum security , defenders must perfectly synchronize their randomized allocations of resources",Background,msa_1818018820
"However , in real-life scenarios ( such as protection of the port of Boston ) this is not the case",Purpose,msa_1818018820
"Our goal is to quantify the loss incurred by miscoordination between defenders , both theoretically and empirically",Purpose,msa_1818018820
We introduce two notions,Mechanism,msa_1818018820
that capture this loss,Purpose,msa_1818018820
"under different assumptions : the price of miscoordination , and the price of sequential commitment",Mechanism,msa_1818018820
"Generally speaking , our theoretical bounds",Method,msa_1818018820
"indicate that the loss may be extremely high in the worst case ,",Findings,msa_1818018820
while our simulations,Method,msa_1818018820
"In real world industrial applications of topic modeling , the ability to capture gigantic conceptual space by learning an ultra-high dimensional topical representation , i",Background,msa_1822248432
", the so-called `` big model '' , is becoming the next desideratum after enthusiasms on `` big data '' , especially for fine-grained downstream tasks such as online advertising , where good performances are usually achieved by regression-based predictors built on millions if not billions of input features",Background,msa_1822248432
"The conventional data-parallel approach for training gigantic topic models turns out to be rather inefficient in utilizing the power of parallelism , due to the heavy dependency on a centralized image of `` model ''",Purpose,msa_1822248432
"Big model size also poses another challenge on the storage , where available model size is bounded by the smallest RAM of nodes",Purpose,msa_1822248432
"To address these issues ,",Purpose,msa_1822248432
"we explore another type of parallelism , namely model-parallelism ,",Mechanism,msa_1822248432
which enables training of disjoint blocks of a big topic model in parallel,Purpose,msa_1822248432
"By integrating data-parallelism with model-parallelism , we show that dependencies between distributed elements can be handled seamlessly , achieving not only faster convergence but also an ability to tackle significantly bigger model size",Mechanism,msa_1822248432
"We describe an architecture for model-parallel inference of LDA , and present a variant of collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm tailored for it",Mechanism,msa_1822248432
Experimental results,Method,msa_1822248432
"The proliferation of mobile devices that are capable of estimating their position , has lead to the emergence of a new class of social networks , namely location-based social networks ( LBSNs for short )",Background,msa_182499956
The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing,Background,msa_182499956
"While the latter can be realized through continuous tracking of a user 's whereabouts from the service provider , the majority of LBSNs allow users to voluntarily share their location , through check-ins",Purpose,msa_182499956
LBSNs provide incentives to users to perform check-ins,Purpose,msa_182499956

"The computational characterization of game-theoretic solution concepts is a central topic in artificial intelligence , with the aim of developing computationally efficient tools for finding optimal ways to behave in strategic interactions",Background,msa_1826503513
The central solution concept in game theory is Nash equilibrium ( NE ),Background,msa_1826503513
"However , it fails to capture the possibility that agents can form coalitions ( even in the 2-agent case )",Background,msa_1826503513
Strong Nash equilibrium ( SNE ) refines NE to this setting,Background,msa_1826503513
It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number of agents is constant,Background,msa_1826503513
"This hardness is solely due to the existence of mixed-strategy SNEs , given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy SNEs is trivially in P",Background,msa_1826503513
"Our central result is that , in order for a game to have at least one non-pure-strategy SNE , the agents ' payoffs restricted to the agents ' supports must , in the case of 2 agents , lie on the same line , and , in the case of n agents , lie on an ( n - 1 ) -dimensional hyperplane",Purpose,msa_1826503513

"Many modern machine learning ( ML ) algorithms are iterative , converging on a final solution via many iterations over the input data",Background,msa_1833917188
"This paper explores approaches to exploiting these algorithms ' convergent nature to improve performance , by allowing parallel and distributed threads to use loose consistency models for shared algorithm state",Purpose,msa_1833917188
"Specifically , we focus on bounded staleness , in which each thread can see a view of the current intermediate solution that may be a limited number of iterations out-of-date",Mechanism,msa_1833917188
Allowing staleness reduces communication costs ( batched updates and cached reads ) and synchronization ( less waiting for locks or straggling threads ),Mechanism,msa_1833917188
"One approach is to increase the number of iterations between barriers in the oft-used Bulk Synchronous Parallel ( BSP ) model of parallelizing , which mitigates these costs when all threads proceed at the same speed",Mechanism,msa_1833917188
"A more flexible approach , called Stale Synchronous Parallel ( SSP ) , avoids barriers and allows threads to be a bounded number of iterations ahead of the current slowest thread",Mechanism,msa_1833917188

"Designing optimalthat is , revenue-maximizingcombinatorial auctions ( CAs ) is an important elusive problem",Purpose,msa_1844580627
It is unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale,Background,msa_1844580627
"Rather than pursuing the manual approach of attempting to characterize the optimal CA , we introduce a family of CAs and then seek a high-revenue auction within that family",Mechanism,msa_1844580627
The family is based on bidder weighting and allocation boosting ; we coin such CAs virtual valuations combinatorial auctions ( VVCAs ),Mechanism,msa_1844580627
VVCAs are the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves ( VCG ) mechanism executed on virtual valuations that are affine transformations of the bidders valuations,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
The auction family is parameterized by the coefficients in the transformations,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
The problem of designing a CA is thereby reduced to search in the parameter space of VVCAor the more general space of affine maximizer auctions,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
We first construct VVCAs with logarithmic approximation guarantees in canonical special settings : ( 1 ) limited supply with additive valuations and ( 2 ) unlimited supply,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
"In the main part of the paper , we develop algorithms that design high-revenue CAs for general valuations using samples from the prior distribution over bidders valuations",Mechanism,msa_1844580627
( Priors turn out to be necessary for achieving high revenue,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
) We prove properties of the problem that guide our design of algorithms,Mechanism,msa_1844580627
We then introduce a series of algorithms that use economic insights to guide the search and thus reduce the computational complexity,Mechanism,msa_1844580627

The increasing performance of modern processors makes virtualization a viable solution for consolidating real-time systems into a single hardware platform,Background,msa_1892303214
"Although real-time task scheduling in a virtual machine can benefit from hierarchical scheduling , unbounded interrupt handling time and vulnerability to interrupt storms make practitioners hesitant to virtualize interrupt-driven real-time applications",Purpose,msa_1892303214
"In this paper , we propose vINT , an interrupt handling scheme",Mechanism,msa_1892303214
designed for real-time system virtualization,Purpose,msa_1892303214
"vINT provides a pseudo-VCPU abstraction dedicated for interrupt handling , which overcomes the limits imposed by the timing parameters of virtual CPUs in an analyzable way",Mechanism,msa_1892303214
vINT also accounts for and enforces interrupt handling and resulting execution flows within a guest virtual machine,Mechanism,msa_1892303214
"vINT does not require any change to the guest OS code , so it can be used for virtualizing proprietary , closed-source OSs",Mechanism,msa_1892303214
"We analyze interrupt handling time as well as VCPU and task schedulability , with and without vINT",Method,msa_1892303214
Our experimental results indicate that vINT achieves timely interrupt handling while providing as good task schedulability as when it is not used,Findings,msa_1892303214
Our case study based on a prototype implementation on the KVM hyper visor,Method,msa_1892303214
Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for practical large-scale equilibrium computation in incomplete-information games,Background,msa_189373357
"However , imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood , and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known",Purpose,msa_189373357
"In this paper , we show the first general , algorithm-agnostic , solution quality guarantees",Mechanism,msa_189373357
for Nash equilibria,Purpose,msa_189373357
"and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions , when implemented in the original ( perfect-recall ) game",Mechanism,msa_189373357
Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions where any results had been obtained,Mechanism,msa_189373357
"Further , our analysis is tighter in two ways , each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound",Mechanism,msa_189373357
"We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties , the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem , where the increase in our bound is the distance function",Mechanism,msa_189373357
This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds,Mechanism,msa_189373357
We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems,Mechanism,msa_189373357
"If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction , the input forms a metric space",Mechanism,msa_189373357
"Conversely , if this condition is not satisfied , we show that the input does not form a metric space",Mechanism,msa_189373357
"In this paper , we focus on complex event detection in internet videos while also providing the key evidences of the detection results",Purpose,msa_1900913856
Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) have achieved promising performance in image classification and action recognition tasks,Purpose,msa_1900913856
"However , it remains an open problem how to use CNNs for video event detection and recounting , mainly due to the complexity and diversity of video events",Purpose,msa_1900913856
"In this work , we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure , namely Deep Event Network ( DevNet ) , that simultaneously detects pre-defined events and provides key spatial-temporal evidences",Mechanism,msa_1900913856
"Taking key frames of videos as input , we first detect the event of interest at the video level by aggregating the CNN features of the key frames",Mechanism,msa_1900913856
"The pieces of evidences which recount the detection results , are also automatically localized , both temporally and spatially",Mechanism,msa_1900913856
"The challenge is that we only have video level labels , while the key evidences usually take place at the frame levels",Mechanism,msa_1900913856
"Based on the intrinsic property of CNNs , we first generate a spatial-temporal saliency map by back passing through DevNet , which then can be used to find the key frames which are most indicative to the event , as well as to localize the specific spatial position , usually an object , in the frame of the highly indicative area",Mechanism,msa_1900913856

"Formal verification of industrial systems is very challenging , due to reasons ranging from scalability issues to communication difficulties with engineering-focused teams",Background,msa_1901338635
"More importantly , industrial systems are rarely designed for verification , but rather for operational needs",Background,msa_1901338635
In this paper we present an overview of our experience using hybrid systems theorem proving,Mechanism,msa_1901338635
"to formally verify ACAS X ,",Purpose,msa_1901338635
an airborne collision avoidance system for airliners scheduled to be operational around 2020,Mechanism,msa_1901338635

Modern day law enforcement banks heavily on the use of commercial off-the-shelf ( COTS ) face recognition systems ( FRS ) as a tool for biometric evaluation and identification,Background,msa_1902324625
"However , in many real-world scenarios , when the face of an individual is occluded or degraded in some way , commercial recognition systems fail to accept the face for evaluation or simply return unusable matched faces",Background,msa_1902324625
"In these kinds of cases , forensic experts rely on image processing techniques and tools , to make the face fit to be processed by the commercial recognition systems ( e",Background,msa_1902324625
g,Background,msa_1902324625
"use partial face images from another subject to fill in the occluded parts of the face of interest , or have a tight crop around the face )",Background,msa_1902324625
"In this study , we evaluate the sensitivity of commercial recognition systems to such forensic techniques",Purpose,msa_1902324625
"More specifically , we study the change in the rank-1 identification result that is caused by forensic processing of faces-of-interest that are unusable by the commercial recognition systems",Method,msa_1902324625
"Further , forensic processing of such faces is more of an art and it is extremely difficult to process faces consistently such that there is a predictable effect on the rank-n identification result",Method,msa_1902324625
This study is meant to serve as an evaluation of the effect of a few forensic techniques intended to allow commercial recognition systems to process and match face images that were otherwise unusable,Purpose,msa_1902324625
Third parties play a prominent role in network-based explanations for successful knowledge transfer,Background,msa_1902444984
Third parties can be either shared or unshared,Background,msa_1902444984
Shared third parties signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer,Background,msa_1902444984
"Unshared third parties , however , signal outsider status and are believed to undermine knowledge transfer",Background,msa_1902444984
"Surprisingly , unshared third parties have been ignored in empirical analysis , and so we do not know if or how much unshared third parties contribute to the process",Background,msa_1902444984
"Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum ,",Method,msa_1902444984
we illustrate how unshared third parties affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships,Purpose,msa_1902444984
Empirical,Method,msa_1902444984
"results indicate that unshared third parties undermine knowledge sharing , and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared third parties overlap in what they know",Findings,msa_1902444984
Our results provide a more complete view of how third parties contribute to knowledge sharing,Background,msa_1902444984
The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly,Background,msa_1902444984

A lot of real-world data is spread across multiple domains,Background,msa_1913277147
Handling such data has been a challenging task,Background,msa_1913277147
Heterogeneous face biometrics has begun to receive attention in recent years,Background,msa_1913277147
"In real-world scenarios , many surveillance cameras capture data in the NIR ( near infrared ) spectrum",Background,msa_1913277147
"However , most datasets accessible to law enforcement have been collected in the VIS ( visible light ) domain",Purpose,msa_1913277147
"Thus , there exists a need to match NIR to VIS face images",Purpose,msa_1913277147
"In this paper , we approach the problem",Purpose,msa_1913277147
by developing a method to reconstruct VIS images in the NIR domain and vice-versa,Mechanism,msa_1913277147
This approach is more applicable to real-world scenarios since it does not involve having to project millions of VIS database images into learned common subspace for subsequent matching,Mechanism,msa_1913277147
We present a cross-spectral joint l 0 minimization based dictionary learning approach to learn a mapping function between the two domains,Mechanism,msa_1913277147
One can then use the function to reconstruct facial images between the domains,Mechanism,msa_1913277147

Could we have a generative model to create communication events with realistic inter-event time distributions ( IEDs ) ? Which properties should we strive to match ?",Background,msa_1916983229
Current literature has seemingly contradictory results for IED : some studies claim good fits with power laws ; others with non-homogeneous Poisson processes,Purpose,msa_1916983229
"Given these two approaches , we ask : which is the correct one ? Can we reconcile them all ? We show here that , surprisingly , both approaches are correct ,",Purpose,msa_1916983229
being corner cases of the proposed Self-Feeding Process ( SFP ),Mechanism,msa_1916983229
"We show that the SFP ( a ) exhibits a unifying power , which generates power law tails ( including the so-called `` top-concavity '' that real data exhibits ) , as well as short-term Poisson behavior ; ( b ) avoids the `` i",Mechanism,msa_1916983229

Gaussian processes ( GPs ) are a flexible class of methods with state of the art performance on spatial statistics applications,Background,msa_1917966882
"However , GPs require O ( n3 ) computations and O ( n2 ) storage , and popular GP kernels are typically limited to smoothing and interpolation",Background,msa_1917966882
"To address these difficulties , Kronecker methods have been used to exploit structure in the GP covariance matrix for scalability , while allowing for expressive kernel learning ( Wilson et al",Purpose,msa_1917966882
", 2014 )",Purpose,msa_1917966882
"However , fast Kronecker methods have been confined to Gaussian likelihoods",Purpose,msa_1917966882
We propose new scalable Kronecker methods,Mechanism,msa_1917966882
"for Gaussian processes with non-Gaussian likelihoods ,",Purpose,msa_1917966882
"using a Laplace approximation which involves linear conjugate gradients for inference , and a lower bound on the GP marginal likelihood for kernel learning",Mechanism,msa_1917966882
"Our approach has near linear scaling , requiring O ( DnD+1/D ) operations and O ( Dn2/D ) storage , for n training data-points on a dense D > 1 dimensional grid",Mechanism,msa_1917966882
"Moreover , we introduce a log Gaussian Cox process , with highly expressive kernels , for modelling spatiotemporal count processes ,",Mechanism,msa_1917966882

"This article introduces differential hybrid games , which combine differential games with hybrid games",Mechanism,msa_1918406761
"In both kinds of games , two players interact with continuous dynamics",Mechanism,msa_1918406761
"The difference is that hybrid games also provide all the features of hybrid systems and discrete games , but only deterministic differential equations",Background,msa_1918406761
"Differential games , instead , provide differential equations with continuous-time game input by both players , but not the luxury of hybrid games , such as mode switches and discrete-time or alternating adversarial interaction",Background,msa_1918406761
This article augments differential game logic with modalities,Mechanism,msa_1918406761
for the combined dynamics of differential hybrid games,Purpose,msa_1918406761
It shows how hybrid games subsume differential games,Purpose,msa_1918406761
and introduces differential game invariants and differential game variants,Mechanism,msa_1918406761
"Most state-of-the-art action feature extractors involve differential operators , which act as highpass filters and tend to attenuate low frequency action information",Background,msa_1920196880
This attenuation introduces bias to the resulting features and generates ill-conditioned feature matrices,Background,msa_1920196880
The Gaussian Pyramid has been used as a feature enhancing technique that encodes scale-invariant characteristics into the feature space in an attempt to deal with this attenuation,Purpose,msa_1920196880
"However , at the core of the Gaussian Pyramid is a convolutional smoothing operation , which makes it incapable of generating new features at coarse scales",Purpose,msa_1920196880
"In order to address this problem ,",Purpose,msa_1920196880
"we propose a novel feature enhancing technique called Multi-skIp Feature Stacking ( MIFS ) , which stacks features extracted using a family of differential filters parameterized with multiple time skips and encodes shift-invariance into the frequency space",Mechanism,msa_1920196880
MIFS compensates for information lost from using differential operators by recapturing information at coarse scales,Mechanism,msa_1920196880
This recaptured information allows us to match actions at different speeds and ranges of motion,Mechanism,msa_1920196880
We prove that MIFS enhances the learnability of differential-based features exponentially,Mechanism,msa_1920196880
The resulting feature matrices from MIFS have much smaller conditional numbers and variances than those from conventional methods,Mechanism,msa_1920196880

Biometrics has come a long way over the past decade in terms of technologies and devices that are used to verify user identities,Background,msa_1921598571
"Three of the more well studied modalities in this field are the face , iris and fingerprint , with the latter two reporting very high user identification/verification rates",Background,msa_1921598571
In the biometric community there has been little work in studying biomedical signals for user recognition purposes,Purpose,msa_1921598571
"In this paper , we propose using electromyograph ( EMG ) signals as a person 's biometric signature",Mechanism,msa_1921598571
The EMG records the motor unit action potentials ( MUAP ) during any physical motion,Mechanism,msa_1921598571
Our study is done within the context of a person using a keyboard to type a password or any other fixed phrase,Method,msa_1921598571
"Along with EMG signals , we log key press times for the user and study the feasibility of using this data too as a biometric feature",Method,msa_1921598571
"Keypress timings alone if used as a biometric , are very easy to spoof and hence we fuse this modality with EMG signals",Mechanism,msa_1921598571
"In order to classify these features , we use subspace modeling as well as Bayesian classifiers",Mechanism,msa_1921598571
The experiments have been performed within the context of a user typing a fixed pass phrase at a workstation,Method,msa_1921598571
The idea is to monitor both biometric modalities when this action is performed and study user verification across data capture sessions and within capture sessions,Method,msa_1921598571
"Generative score spaces provide a principled method to exploit generative information , e",Background,msa_192226707

"A group 's collective action is an outcome of the group 's decision-making process , which may be reached by either averaging of the individual preferences or following the choices of certain members in the group",Background,msa_1928311886
Our problem here is to decide which decision process the group has adopted given the data of the collective actions,Purpose,msa_1928311886

"Bayesian nonparametric models , such as Gaussian processes , provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling : these models have a high degree of flexibility , and automatically calibrated complexity",Background,msa_1939971942
"However , automating human expertise remains elusive ; for example , Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners",Purpose,msa_1939971942
"In this paper , we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses , and then design a kernel learning framework",Mechanism,msa_1939971942
to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments,Purpose,msa_1939971942
We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in humanlike ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels,Mechanism,msa_1939971942
This paper introduces a new proof calculus,Mechanism,msa_1941921537
for differential dynamic logic ( dL ),Purpose,msa_1941921537
"that is entirely based on uniform substitution , a proof rule that substitutes a formula for a predicate symbol everywhere",Mechanism,msa_1941921537
"Uniform substitutions make it possible to rely on axioms rather than axiom schemata , substantially simplifying implementations",Mechanism,msa_1941921537
"Instead of nontrivial schema variables and soundness-critical side conditions on the occurrence patterns of variables , the resulting calculus adopts only a finite number of ordinary dL formulas as axioms",Mechanism,msa_1941921537
The static semantics of differential dynamic logic is captured exclusively in uniform substitutions and bound variable renamings as opposed to being spread in delicate ways across the prover implementation,Mechanism,msa_1941921537
"In addition to sound uniform substitutions , this paper introduces differential forms",Mechanism,msa_1941921537
for differential dynamic logic,Purpose,msa_1941921537
that make it possible,Mechanism,msa_1941921537
"While the growth of the mobile apps market has created significant market opportunities and economic incentives for mobile app developers to innovate , it has also inevitably invited other developers to create rip-offs",Background,msa_1942772871
Practitioners and developers of original apps claim that copycats steal the original apps idea and demand and have called for app platforms to take action against such copycats,Background,msa_1942772871
"Surprisingly , however , there has been little rigorous research analyzing whether and how copycats affect an original apps demand",Purpose,msa_1942772871
The primary deterrent to such research is the lack of an objective way to identify similarities between different apps,Purpose,msa_1942772871
"Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as natural language processing , latent semantic analysis , network-based clustering and image analysis , we propose a method",Mechanism,msa_1942772871
to compare apps and detect two types of copycats : deceptive and non-deceptive,Purpose,msa_1942772871
Based on the detection results,Findings,msa_1942772871
", we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the impact of copycat apps on the demand for the original apps on a sample of 10,100 action game apps by 5,141 developers that were released in the iOS App Store over five years",Method,msa_1942772871
Our final results indicate that the effect of copycats on an original apps demand is determined by the quality and level of imitation of the copycat,Findings,msa_1942772871
"High-quality , non-deceptive copycats negatively affect demand for the originals",Findings,msa_1942772871
"In contrast , low-quality , deceptive copycats positively affect demand for the originals",Findings,msa_1942772871
Hidden information derived from probabilistic generative models of data distributions can be used to construct features for discriminative classifiers,Background,msa_1944936460
This observation has motivated the development of approaches that attempt to couple generative and discriminative models together for classification,Background,msa_1944936460
"However , existing approaches typically feed features derived from generative models to discriminative classifiers , and do not refine the generative models or the feature mapping functions based on classification results",Purpose,msa_1944936460
"In this paper , we propose a coupling mechanism developed under the PAC-Bayes framework that can fine-tune the generative models and the feature mapping functions iteratively",Mechanism,msa_1944936460
to improve the classifier 's performance,Purpose,msa_1944936460
"In our approach , a stochastic feature mapping , which is a function over the random variables of a generative model , is derived to generate feature vectors for a stochastic classifier",Mechanism,msa_1944936460
"We construct a stochastic classifier over the feature mapping and derive the PAC-Bayes generalization bound for the classifier , for both supervised and semi-supervised learning",Mechanism,msa_1944936460
This allows us to jointly learn the feature mapping and the classifier by minimizing the bound with an EM-like iterative algorithm using labeled and unlabeled data,Mechanism,msa_1944936460
"The resulting framework integrates the learning of the discriminative classifier and the generative model and allows iterative fine-tuning of the generative models , and the feedforward feature mappings based on task performance feedback",Mechanism,msa_1944936460
"Our experiments show , in three distinct applications",Method,msa_1944936460
What do real communities in social networks look like ?,Purpose,msa_1947476231
"Community detection plays a key role in understanding the structure of real-life graphs with impact on recommendation systems , load balancing and routing",Background,msa_1947476231
Previous community detection methods look for uniform blocks in adjacency matrices,Background,msa_1947476231
"However , after studying four real networks with ground-truth communities",Method,msa_1947476231
", we provide empirical evidence that communities are best represented as having an hyperbolic structure",Findings,msa_1947476231
We detail HyCoM - the Hyperbolic Community Model -,Mechanism,msa_1947476231
"as a better representation of communities and the relationships between their members ,",Purpose,msa_1947476231
and show improvements in compression compared to standard methods,Mechanism,msa_1947476231
"We also introduce HyCoM-FIT , a fast , parameter free algorithm",Mechanism,msa_1947476231
to detect communities with hyperbolic structure,Purpose,msa_1947476231
We show that our method is effective in finding communities with a similar structure to self-declared ones,Findings,msa_1947476231
We report findings,Findings,msa_1947476231
"In this paper , we propose a discriminative video representation for event detection over a large scale video dataset when only limited hardware resources are available",Mechanism,msa_1950136256
"The focus of this paper is to effectively leverage deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) to advance event detection , where only frame level static descriptors can be extracted by the existing CNN toolkits",Purpose,msa_1950136256
This paper makes two contributions to the inference of CNN video representation,Mechanism,msa_1950136256
"First , while average pooling and max pooling have long been the standard approaches to aggregating frame level static features , we show that performance can be significantly improved by taking advantage of an appropriate encoding method",Mechanism,msa_1950136256
"Second , we propose using a set of latent concept descriptors as the frame descriptor , which enriches visual information while keeping it computationally affordable",Mechanism,msa_1950136256
The integration of the two contributions results in a new state-of-the-art performance in event detection over the largest video datasets,Mechanism,msa_1950136256
"Compared to improved Dense Trajectories , which has been recognized as the best video representation for event detection ,",Method,msa_1950136256
We propose a new neurally-inspired model that can learn,Mechanism,msa_1951119168
to encode the global relationship context of visual events across time and space,Purpose,msa_1951119168
and,Mechanism,msa_1951119168
to use the contextual information to modulate the analysis,Purpose,msa_1951119168
by synthesis process in a predictive coding framework,Mechanism,msa_1951119168
The model learns latent contextual representations by maximizing the predictability of visual events based on local and global contextual information through both top-down and bottom-up processes,Mechanism,msa_1951119168
"In contrast to standard predictive coding models , the prediction error in this model is used to update the contextual representation but does not alter the feedforward input for the next layer , and is thus more consistent with neurophysiological observations",Mechanism,msa_1951119168
We establish the computational feasibility of this model by demonstrating its ability in several aspects,Method,msa_1951119168
We show that our model can outperform state-of-art performances of gated Boltzmann machines ( GBM ),Findings,msa_1951119168
in estimation of contextual information,Method,msa_1951119168
Our model can also interpolate missing events or predict future events in image sequences while simultaneously estimating contextual information,Findings,msa_1951119168
We show it achieves state-of-art performances,Findings,msa_1951119168
in terms of prediction accuracy in a variety of tasks,Method,msa_1951119168
We address the problem how high-fidelity verification results about the hybrid systems dynamics of cyber-physical flow systems can be provided at the scale of large ( traffic ) networks without prohibitive analytic cost,Purpose,msa_1952543378
We propose the use of contracts,Mechanism,msa_1952543378
for traffic flow components,Purpose,msa_1952543378
concisely capturing the conditions for a safe operation in the context of a traffic network,Mechanism,msa_1952543378
"This reduces the analysis of flows in the full traffic network to simple arithmetic checks of the local compatibility of the traffic component contracts , while retaining higher-fidelity correctness guarantees of the global hybrid systems models that inherits from correct contracts of the hybrid system components",Mechanism,msa_1952543378
Background Computer-assisted diagnosis of dermoscopic images of skin lesions has the potential to improve melanoma early detection,Background,msa_1952697361
Objective,Purpose,msa_1952697361
We sought to evaluate the performance of a novel classifier that uses decision forest classification of dermoscopic images,Mechanism,msa_1952697361
to generate a lesion severity score,Purpose,msa_1952697361
"Methods Severity scores were calculated for 173 dermoscopic images of skin lesions with known histologic diagnosis ( 39 melanomas , 14 nonmelanoma skin cancers , and 120 benign lesions )",Method,msa_1952697361
A threshold score was used to measure classifier sensitivity and specificity,Method,msa_1952697361
A reader study was conducted to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the classifier with those of 30 dermatology clinicians,Method,msa_1952697361
Results The classifier sensitivity for melanoma was 97,Findings,msa_1952697361
4 % ; specificity was 44,Findings,msa_1952697361
2 % in a test set of images,Findings,msa_1952697361
"In the reader study , the classifier 's sensitivity to melanoma was higher ( P P Limitations This is a retrospective study using existing images primarily chosen for biopsy by a dermatologist",Findings,msa_1952697361
The size of the test set is small,Findings,msa_1952697361
"Most Lamb wave localization techniques require that we know the waves velocity characteristics ; yet , in many practical scenarios , velocity estimates can be challenging to acquire , are unavailable , or are unreliable because of the complexity of Lamb waves",Background,msa_1953094588
"As a result , there is a significant need for new methods that can reduce a systems reliance on a priori velocity information",Purpose,msa_1953094588
This paper addresses this challenge,Purpose,msa_1953094588
through two novel source localization methods designed for sparse sensor arrays in isotropic media,Mechanism,msa_1953094588
Both methods exploit the fundamental sparse structure of a Lamb wave 's frequencywavenumber representation,Mechanism,msa_1953094588
The first method uses sparse recovery techniques to extract velocities from calibration data,Mechanism,msa_1953094588
The second method uses kurtosis and the support earth movers distance to measure the sparseness of a Lamb waves approximate frequency-wavenumber representation,Mechanism,msa_1953094588
These measures are then used to locate acoustic sources with no prior calibration data,Mechanism,msa_1953094588
We experimentally study each method with a collection of acoustic emission data measured from a 1,Method,msa_1953094588

"In this paper we introduce a paradigm for completing complex tasks from wearable devices by leveraging crowdsourcing , and demonstrate its validity for academic writing",Mechanism,msa_1953425792
"We explore this paradigm using a collaborative authoring system , called WearWrite , which is designed",Mechanism,msa_1953425792
to enable authors and crowd workers to work together,Purpose,msa_1953425792
"using an Android smartwatch and Google Docs to produce academic papers , including this one",Mechanism,msa_1953425792
"WearWrite allows expert authors who do not have access to large devices to contribute bits of expertise and big picture direction from their watch , while freeing them of the obligation of integrating their contributions into the overall document",Mechanism,msa_1953425792
Crowd workers on desktop computers actually write the document,Mechanism,msa_1953425792
We used this approach to write several simple papers,Method,msa_1953425792
", and found it was effective at producing reasonable drafts",Findings,msa_1953425792
"However , the workers often needed more structure and the authors more context",Findings,msa_1953425792
WearWrite addresses these issues by focusing workers on specific tasks and providing select context to authors on the watch,Mechanism,msa_1953425792
Road intersections are considered to be serious bottlenecks in urban transportation,Background,msa_1953829737
More than 44 % of all reported crashes in U,Background,msa_1953829737

"Occur within intersection areas , which in turn lead to 8,500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year",Background,msa_1953829737
"Furthermore , because traffic traveling in one direction is generally stopped at busy intersections to allow traffic to flow in another direction , an intersection creates traffic congestion and frustration",Background,msa_1953829737
The impact of road intersections on traffic delays leads to enormous waste of human and natural resources,Background,msa_1953829737
"According to the 2011 Urban Mobility Report , the delay endured by the average commuter was 34 hours , which costs in aggregate more than $ 100 billion each year in the U",Background,msa_1953829737
"With the advances in Cyber-Physical Systems ( CPS ) , autonomous driving as a part of Intelligent Transportation Systems ( ITS ) is likely to be at the heart of urban transportation in the future",Background,msa_1953829737

"General Motors ' Electrical-Networked Vehicle , CMU 's autonomous vehicle and Google 's car are just a few other recently unveiled examples",Background,msa_1953829737
"Therefore , it is critical to address safety and throughput concerns as one of the main challenges for autonomous driving through intersections",Purpose,msa_1953829737
"In this paper , we propose a spatio-temporal technique called the Ballroom Intersection Protocol ( BRIP )",Mechanism,msa_1953829737
to manage the safe and efficient passage of autonomous vehicles through intersections,Purpose,msa_1953829737
"To achieve high throughput at intersections ,",Purpose,msa_1953829737
BRIP aims to maximize the utilization of the capacity of the intersection area by increasing parallelism,Mechanism,msa_1953829737
"By enforcing a synchronized arrival of autonomous vehicles at intersections , BRIP allows vehicles approaching from all directions to simultaneously and continuously cross without stopping behind or inside the intersection area",Mechanism,msa_1953829737

The harmful effects of cell phone usage on driver behavior have been well investigated and the growing problem has motivated several several research efforts aimed at developing automated cell phone usage detection systems,Background,msa_1954390275
Computer vision based approaches for dealing with this problem have only emerged in recent years,Background,msa_1954390275
"In this paper , we present a vision based method",Mechanism,msa_1954390275

on challenging Strategic Highway Research Program ( SHRP2 ) face view videos from the head pose validation data that was acquired to monitor driver head pose variation under naturalistic driving conditions,Method,msa_1954390275
"To the best of our knowledge , this is the first such evaluation carried out using this relatively new data",Mechanism,msa_1954390275
Our approach utilizes the Supervised Descent Method ( SDM ) based facial landmark tracking algorithm to track the locations of facial landmarks in order to extract a crop of the region of interest,Mechanism,msa_1954390275
"Following this , features are extracted from the crop and are classified using previously trained classifiers in order to determine if a driver is holding a cell phone",Mechanism,msa_1954390275
"The use of deductive techniques , such as theorem provers , has several advantages in safety verification of hybrid systems ; however , state-of-the-art theorem provers require manual intervention to handle complex systems",Background,msa_1958676488
"Furthermore , there is often a gap between the type of assistance that a theorem prover requires to make progress on a proof task and the assistance that a system designer is able to provide directly",Purpose,msa_1958676488
"This paper presents an extension to KeYmaera , a deductive verification tool",Mechanism,msa_1958676488
for differential dynamic logic,Purpose,msa_1958676488

"In recent years , many lawsuits have been filed by individuals seeking legal redress for harms caused by the loss or theft of their personal information",Background,msa_1960191312
"However , very little is known about the drivers , mechanics , and outcomes of those lawsuits , making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of litigation at balancing organizations ' usage of personal data with individual privacy rights",Purpose,msa_1960191312
"Using a unique and manually collected database , we analyze court dockets for more than 230 federal data breach lawsuits from 2000 to 2010",Method,msa_1960191312
We investigate two questions : Which data breaches are being litigated ? and Which data breach lawsuits are settling ?,Purpose,msa_1960191312
Our results suggest that the odds of a firm being sued are 3,Findings,msa_1960191312
"5 times greater when individuals suffer financial harm , but 6 times lower when the firm provides free credit monitoring",Findings,msa_1960191312

Epidemics in large complete networks is well established,Background,msa_1960454908

We establish the fluid limit macroscopic dynamics of a multi-virus spread over a multipartite network as the number of nodes at each partite or island grows large,Mechanism,msa_1960454908
The virus spread follows a peer-to-peer random rule of infection in line with the Harris contact process,Mechanism,msa_1960454908
"The model conforms to an SIS ( susceptible-infected-susceptible ) type , where a node is either infected or it is healthy and prone to be infected",Mechanism,msa_1960454908

"Instant access to computing , when and where we need it , has long been one of the aims of research areas such as ubiquitous computing",Background,msa_1963735412
"In this paper , we describe the WorldKit system , which makes use of a paired depth camera and projector",Mechanism,msa_1963735412
to make ordinary surfaces instantly interactive,Purpose,msa_1963735412
"Using this system , touch-based interactivity can , without prior calibration , be placed on nearly any unmodified surface literally with a wave of the hand , as can other new forms of sensed interaction",Mechanism,msa_1963735412
"From a user perspective , such interfaces are easy enough to instantiate that they could , if desired , be recreated or modified `` each time we sat down '' by `` painting '' them next to us",Mechanism,msa_1963735412
"From the programmer 's perspective , our system encapsulates these capabilities in a simple set of abstractions that make the creation of interfaces quick and easy",Mechanism,msa_1963735412
"Further , it is extensible to new , custom interactors in a way that closely mimics conventional 2D graphical user interfaces , hiding much of the complexity of working in this new domain",Mechanism,msa_1963735412

"How can we describe a large , dynamic graph over time ? Is it random ? If not , what are the most apparent deviations from randomness -- a dense block of actors that persists over time , or perhaps a star with many satellite nodes that appears with some fixed periodicity ? In practice , these deviations indicate patterns -- for example , botnet attackers forming a bipartite core with their victims over the duration of an attack , family members bonding in a clique-like fashion over a difficult period of time , or research collaborations forming and fading away over the years",Background,msa_1964669181
"Which patterns exist in real-world dynamic graphs , and how can we find and rank them in terms of importance ? These are exactly the problems we focus on in this work",Purpose,msa_1964669181

"Generating three-dimensional ( 3D ) as-is Building Information Models ( BIMs ) , representative of the existing conditions of buildings , from point cloud data collected by laser scanners is becoming common practice",Background,msa_1966173718
"However , generation of such models currently is mostly performed manually , and errors can be introduced during data collection , pre-processing , and modeling",Purpose,msa_1966173718
This paper presents a method,Mechanism,msa_1966173718
for assessing the quality of as-is BIMs generated from point cloud data,Purpose,msa_1966173718
by analyzing the patterns of geometric deviations between the model and the point cloud data,Mechanism,msa_1966173718
The fundamental assumption is that the point cloud and the as-is BIM generated from the point cloud should corroborate in the depiction of the components and their spatial attributes,Mechanism,msa_1966173718
"Major geometric deviations between as-is models and point clouds can indicate potential errors introduced during data collection , processing and/or model generation",Mechanism,msa_1966173718
"The research described in this paper provides a taxonomy for patterns of deviations and sources of errors and demonstrates that it is possible to identify the source , magnitude , and nature of errors by analyzing the deviation patterns",Mechanism,msa_1966173718
The method is validated through a comparison with the currently adopted physical measurement method in a case study,Method,msa_1966173718
"Learning , whether motor , sensory or cognitive , requires networks of neurons to generate new activity patterns",Background,msa_1966537851
"As some behaviours are easier to learn than others1 , 2 ,",Background,msa_1966537851
we asked if some neural activity patterns are easier to generate than others,Purpose,msa_1966537851
"Here we investigate whether an existing network constrains the patterns that a subset of its neurons is capable of exhibiting , and if so , what principles define this constraint",Purpose,msa_1966537851
We employed a closed-loop intracortical braincomputer interface learning paradigm in which Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) controlled a computer cursor by modulating neural activity patterns in the primary motor cortex,Mechanism,msa_1966537851
"Using the braincomputer interface paradigm , we could specify and alter how neural activity mapped to cursor velocity",Mechanism,msa_1966537851
"At the start of each session , we observed the characteristic activity patterns of the recorded neural population",Method,msa_1966537851
"The activity of a neural population can be represented in a high-dimensional space ( termed the neural space ) , wherein each dimension corresponds to the activity of one neuron",Mechanism,msa_1966537851
These characteristic activity patterns comprise a low-dimensional subspace ( termed the intrinsic manifold ) within the neural space,Mechanism,msa_1966537851
The intrinsic manifold presumably reflects constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry,Mechanism,msa_1966537851
Here we show that the animals could readily learn to proficiently control the cursor using neural activity patterns that were within the intrinsic manifold,Findings,msa_1966537851
"However , animals were less able to learn to proficiently control the cursor using activity patterns that were outside of the intrinsic manifold",Findings,msa_1966537851
"AbstractUnderstanding the value that individuals assign to the protection of their personal data is of great importance for business , law , and public policy",Background,msa_1967317786
We use a field experiment informed by behavioral economics and decision research,Method,msa_1967317786
to investigate individual privacy valuations and find evidence of endowment and order effects,Purpose,msa_1967317786
Individuals assigned markedly different values to the privacy of their data depending on ( 1 ) whether they were asked to consider how much money they would accept to disclose otherwise private information or how much they would pay to protect otherwise public information and ( 2 ) the order in which they considered different offers for their data,Findings,msa_1967317786

Modern offices are crowded with personal computers,Background,msa_1967420911
"While studies have shown these to be idle most of the time , they remain powered , consuming up to 60p of their peak power",Background,msa_1967420911
Hardware-based solutions engendered by PC vendors ( e,Background,msa_1967420911

Recent proposals have advocated the use of consolidation of idle desktop Virtual Machines ( VMs ),Purpose,msa_1967420911
"However , desktop VMs are often large , requiring gigabytes of memory",Purpose,msa_1967420911
Consolidating such VMs creates large network transfers lasting in the order of minutes and utilizes server memory inefficiently,Purpose,msa_1967420911
"When multiple VMs migrate concurrently , networks become congested , and the resulting migration latencies are prohibitive",Purpose,msa_1967420911
"We present partial VM migration , an approach",Mechanism,msa_1967420911
that transparently migrates only the working set of an idle VM,Purpose,msa_1967420911
"It creates a partial replica of the desktop VM on the consolidation server by copying only VM metadata , and it transfers pages to the server on-demand , as the VM accesses them",Mechanism,msa_1967420911
This approach places desktop PCs in low-power mode when inactive and switches them to running mode when pages are needed by the VM running on the consolidation server,Mechanism,msa_1967420911
"To ensure that desktops save energy , we have developed sleep scheduling and prefetching algorithms , as well as the context-aware selective resume framework , a novel approach to reduce the latency of power mode transition operations in commodity PCs",Mechanism,msa_1967420911

Event detection from real surveillance videos with complicated background environment is always a very hard task,Background,msa_1967760097

We study theoretical runtime guarantees for a class of optimization problems that occur in a wide variety of inference problems,Purpose,msa_1968307589
These problems are motivated by the LASSO framework and have applications in machine learning and computer vision,Background,msa_1968307589
Our work shows a close connection between these problems and core questions in algorithmic graph theory,Purpose,msa_1968307589
"While this connection demonstrates the difficulties of obtaining runtime guarantees , it also suggests an approach of using techniques originally developed for graph algorithms",Mechanism,msa_1968307589
"We then show that most of these problems can be formulated as a grouped least squares problem , and give efficient algorithms for this formulation",Mechanism,msa_1968307589
"Our algorithms rely on routines for solving quadratic minimization problems , which in turn are equivalent to solving linear systems",Mechanism,msa_1968307589
Fluctuations in the growth rate of a bacterial culture during unbalanced growth are generally considered undesirable in quantitative studies of bacterial physiology,Background,msa_1969482186
"Under well-controlled experimental conditions , however , these fluctuations are not random but instead reflect the interplay between intra-cellular networks underlying bacterial growth and the growth environment",Background,msa_1969482186
"Therefore , these fluctuations could be considered quantitative phenotypes of the bacteria under a specific growth condition",Purpose,msa_1969482186
"Here , we present a method",Mechanism,msa_1969482186
to identify phenotypic signatures,Purpose,msa_1969482186
by time-frequency analysis of unbalanced growth curves measured with high temporal resolution,Mechanism,msa_1969482186
"The signatures are then applied to differentiate amongst different bacterial strains or the same strain under different growth conditions , and to identify the essential architecture of the gene network underlying the observed growth dynamics",Mechanism,msa_1969482186
"At the core of Machine Learning ( ML ) analytics is often an expert-suggested model , whose parameters are refined by iteratively processing a training dataset until convergence",Background,msa_1969805974
The completion time ( i,Background,msa_1969805974
e,Background,msa_1969805974
convergence time ) and quality of the learned model not only depends on the rate at which the refinements are generated but also the quality of each refinement,Background,msa_1969805974
"While data-parallel ML applications often employ a loose consistency model when updating shared model parameters to maximize parallelism , the accumulated error may seriously impact the quality of refinements and thus delay completion time , a problem that usually gets worse with scale",Purpose,msa_1969805974
"Although more immediate propagation of updates reduces the accumulated error , this strategy is limited by physical network bandwidth",Purpose,msa_1969805974
"Additionally , the performance of the widely used stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) algorithm is sensitive to step size",Purpose,msa_1969805974
Simply increasing communication often fails to bring improvement without tuning step size accordingly and tedious hand tuning is usually needed to achieve optimal performance,Purpose,msa_1969805974
"This paper presents Bosen , a system that maximizes the network communication efficiency under a given inter-machine network bandwidth budget to minimize parallel error , while ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees for large-scale data-parallel ML applications",Mechanism,msa_1969805974
"Furthermore , Bosen prioritizes messages most significant to algorithm convergence , further enhancing algorithm convergence",Mechanism,msa_1969805974

Autonomous driving will play an important role in the future of transportation,Background,msa_1969806274
Various autonomous vehicles have been demonstrated at the DARPA Urban Challenge [ 3 ],Background,msa_1969806274
"General Motors has recently unveiled their Electrical-Networked Vehicles ( EN-V ) in Shanghai , China [ 5 ]",Background,msa_1969806274
One of the main challenges of autonomous driving in urban areas is transition through cross-roads and intersections,Background,msa_1969806274
"In addition to safety concerns , current intersection management technologies such as stop signs and traffic lights can introduce significant traffic delays even under light traffic conditions",Background,msa_1969806274

Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) enable everyone to receive high-quality education,Background,msa_1969830854
"However , current MOOC creators can not provide an effective , economical , and scalable method to detect cheating on tests , which would be required for any certification",Purpose,msa_1969830854

to detect cheating behaviors in online tests,Purpose,msa_1969830854
"The MOOP framework consists of three major components : Automatic Cheating Detector ( ACD ) , Peer Cheating Detector ( PCD ) , and Final Review Committee ( FRC )",Mechanism,msa_1969830854
ACD uses webcam video or other sensors to monitor students and automatically flag suspected cheating behavior,Mechanism,msa_1969830854
"Ambiguous cases are then sent to the PCD , where students peer-review flagged webcam video to confirm suspicious cheating behaviors",Mechanism,msa_1969830854

Visible light communication ( VLC ) between LED light bulbs and smart-phone cameras has already begun to gain traction for identification and indoor localization applications,Background,msa_1970287930

This allows the camera communication VLC channel to also act as a higher speed downstream link and low-power wakeup mechanism for energy-constrained devices,Mechanism,msa_1970287930
Our approach uses Manchester encoding and Binary Frequency Shift Keying ( BFSK ) to modulate the high-speed data stream and applies duty-cycle adjustment to generate the slower camera communication signal,Mechanism,msa_1970287930
We explore the trade-off between the performance of the two communication channels,Mechanism,msa_1970287930
Our hybrid communication protocol is also compatible with existing IR receivers,Mechanism,msa_1970287930
"This allows lights to communicate with low-cost commodity chipsets and control home appliances such as TVs , AV receivers , AC window units , etc",Mechanism,msa_1970287930

We propose a novel discrete signal processing framework,Mechanism,msa_1971368490

"Such datasets arise in many social , economic , biological , and physical networks",Background,msa_1971368490
"Our framework extends traditional discrete signal processing theory to structured datasets by viewing them as signals represented by graphs , so that signal coefficients are indexed by graph nodes and relations between them are represented by weighted graph edges",Mechanism,msa_1971368490

Computational methods have been widely used to infer properties of complex systems that one can not directly observe experimentally,Background,msa_1971524302
"Viral capsid assembly is a key model system for complex self-assembly for which we lack direct experimental data on critical information , such as kinetic parameters , needed to build models and reveal detailed assembly pathways",Background,msa_1971524302
"We previously sought to learn such hidden parameters with a heuristic optimization approach using gradient and response surface methods applied to the light scattering measurements of three in vitro viral assembly systems : human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ( CCMV )",Background,msa_1971524302
This method successfully learned plausible kinetic parameters for all the three viruses leading to reconstruction of detailed models of assembly pathways,Background,msa_1971524302
"Significant computational challenges , however , hinder our ability to construct more precise or detailed models and reliably quantify uncertainty in the inferences",Purpose,msa_1971524302
"First , there is no closed form representation for the quality of fit of models to data , which therefore must be evaluated through computationally costly simulations",Purpose,msa_1971524302
"Second , the problem requires stochastic simulations , and the resulting simulation trajectories must be averaged over many replicates to suppress noise",Purpose,msa_1971524302
"Third , optimization of parameters must account for unknown factors and imprecision of experimental measurements",Purpose,msa_1971524302

Results :,Findings,msa_1971567789
These findings quantify the large recording differences stemming from anatomical differences in depth and the layer dependent relative changes to SU and MU recording performance over 6-months,Method,msa_1971567789
"For example , performance metrics in Layer V and stratum pyramidale were initially higher than Layer II/III , but decrease more rapidly",Findings,msa_1971567789

Multimedia event detection ( MED ) is an emerging area of research,Background,msa_1971695614
"Previous work mainly focuses on simple event detection in sports and news videos , or abnormality detection in surveillance videos",Purpose,msa_1971695614
"In contrast , we focus on detecting more complicated and generic events that gain more users ' interest , and we explore an effective solution for MED",Purpose,msa_1971695614
"Moreover , our solution only uses few positive examples since precisely labeled multimedia content is scarce in the real world",Mechanism,msa_1971695614
"As the information from these few positive examples is limited , we propose using knowledge adaptation to facilitate event detection",Mechanism,msa_1971695614
"Different from the state of the art , our algorithm is able to adapt knowledge from another source for MED even if the features of the source and the target are partially different , but overlapping",Mechanism,msa_1971695614
Avoiding the requirement that the two domains are consistent in feature types is desirable as data collection platforms change or augment their capabilities and we should be able to respond to this with little or no effort,Mechanism,msa_1971695614

"In the training stage , data is recorded from intact pipe , and from a pipe with an artificial structural abnormality ( to simulate any variation from intact condition )",Mechanism,msa_1972009899
"During the monitoring stage , test signals are projected on the discriminant vector , and these projections are used as damage -sensitive features for detection purposes",Mechanism,msa_1972009899
"Being a supervised metho d , factors such as EOC variations , and difference in the characteristics of the structural abnormality in training and test data , may affect the detection performance",Mechanism,msa_1972009899

We address the problem of action recognition in unconstrained videos,Purpose,msa_1973210879
We propose a novel content driven pooling that leverages space-time context while being robust toward global space-time transformations,Mechanism,msa_1973210879
Being robust to such transformations is of primary importance in unconstrained videos where the action localizations can drastically shift between frames,Mechanism,msa_1973210879
Our pooling identifies regions of interest using video structural cues estimated by different saliency functions,Mechanism,msa_1973210879

Lamb waves are powerful tools in nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring,Background,msa_1974019330
Researchers use Lamb waves to detect and locate damage across large areas,Background,msa_1974019330
"To best utilize Lamb waves , they are analyzed through two processing steps : baseline subtraction and velocity calibration",Background,msa_1974019330
Baseline subtraction removes background information from our data and velocity calibration tunes our algorithms,Background,msa_1974019330
"Yet , in many scenarios , these steps are challenging to implement",Background,msa_1974019330
Baseline subtraction is challenging due to variable environmental conditions,Purpose,msa_1974019330
Velocity calibration is challenging due to multi-modal and dispersive velocity behavior in Lamb waves,Purpose,msa_1974019330

"Modern robots , like todays smartphones , are complex devices with intricate software systems",Background,msa_1974295616

"As airspace becomes ever more crowded , air traffic management must reduce both space and time between aircraft to increase throughput , making on-board collision avoidance systems ever more important",Background,msa_1974314710
"These safety-critical systems must be extremely reliable , and as such , many resources are invested into ensuring that the protocols they implement are accurate",Background,msa_1974314710
"Still , it is challenging to guarantee that such a controller works properly under every circumstance",Background,msa_1974314710
"In tough scenarios where a large number of aircraft must execute a collision avoidance maneuver , a human pilot under stress is not necessarily able to understand the complexity of the distributed system and may not take the right course , especially if actions must be taken quickly",Purpose,msa_1974314710
We consider a class of distributed collision avoidance controllers designed to work even in environments with arbitrarily many aircraft or UAVs,Method,msa_1974314710
"We prove that the controllers never allow the aircraft to get too close to one another , even when new planes approach an in-progress avoidance maneuver that the new plane may not be aware of",Findings,msa_1974314710

"Brand Associations , one of central concepts in marketing , describe customers ' top-of-mind attitudes or feelings toward a brand",Background,msa_1975327536
"Thus , this consumer-driven brand equity often attains the grounds for purchasing products or services of the brand",Background,msa_1975327536
"Traditionally , brand associations are measured by analyzing the text data from consumers ' responses to the survey or their online conversation logs",Purpose,msa_1975327536
"In this paper , we propose to go beyond text data and leverage large-scale online photo collections contributed by the general public , which have not been explored so far",Purpose,msa_1975327536
"As a first technical step toward the study of photo-based brand associations , we aim to jointly achieve the following two visualization tasks in a mutually-rewarding way : ( i ) detecting and visualizing core visual concepts associated with brands , and ( ii ) localizing the regions of brand in the images",Mechanism,msa_1975327536
"With experiments on about five millions of images of 48 brands crawled from five popular online photo sharing sites ,",Method,msa_1975327536
we demonstrate that our approach can discover complementary views on the brand associations that are hardly mined from the text data,Findings,msa_1975327536
We also quantitatively,Method,msa_1975327536
"How does malware propagate ? Does it form spikes over time ? Does it resemble the propagation pattern of benign files , such as software patches ? Does it spread uniformly over countries ? How long does it take for a URL that distributes malware to be detected and shut down ? In this work , we answer these questions",Purpose,msa_1975452715
"by analyzing patterns from 22 million malicious ( and benign ) files , found on 1",Method,msa_1975452715
6 million hosts worldwide during the month of June 2011,Method,msa_1975452715
We conduct this study using the WINE database available at Symantec Research Labs,Method,msa_1975452715
"Additionally , we explore the research questions raised by sampling on such large databases of executables ;",Method,msa_1975452715
"the importance of studying the implications of sampling is twofold : First , sampling is a means of reducing the size of the database hence making it more accessible to researchers ; second , because every such data collection can be perceived as a sample of the real world",Background,msa_1975452715
"We discover the SharkFin temporal propagation pattern of executable files , the GeoSplit pattern in the geographical spread of machines that report executables to Symantecs servers , the Periodic Power Law ( Ppl ) distribution of the lifetime of URLs , and we show how",Mechanism,msa_1975452715
to efficiently extrapolate crucial properties of the data from a small sample,Purpose,msa_1975452715
"We further investigate the propagation pattern of benign and malicious executables , unveiling latent structures in the way these files spread",Method,msa_1975452715
This paper introduces the concept of crowd storage,Mechanism,msa_1975621655
", the idea that digital files can be stored and retrieved later from the memories of people in the crowd",Purpose,msa_1975621655
"Similar to human memory , crowd storage is ephemeral , which means that storage is temporary and the quality of the stored information degrades over time",Mechanism,msa_1975621655
"Crowd storage may be preferred over storing information directly in the cloud , or when it is desirable for information to degrade inline with normal human memories",Mechanism,msa_1975621655
"To explore and validate this idea ,",Purpose,msa_1975621655
"we created WeStore , a system that stores and then later retrieves digital files in the existing memories of crowd workers",Mechanism,msa_1975621655
"WeStore does not store information directly , but rather encrypts the files using details of the existing memories elicited from individuals within the crowd as cryptographic keys",Mechanism,msa_1975621655
The fidelity of the retrieved information is tied to how well the crowd remembers the details of the memories they provided,Mechanism,msa_1975621655
We demonstrate that crowd storage is feasible,Findings,msa_1975621655
"using an existing crowd marketplace ( Amazon Mechanical Turk ) , explore design considerations important for building systems that use crowd storage",Method,msa_1975621655
", and outline ideas for future research in this",Background,msa_1975621655
We present a cloud-based approach,Mechanism,msa_1975621741
"to opportunistic , near real-time search of untagged images on smartphones",Purpose,msa_1975621741
that is sensitive to bandwidth and energy constraints,Mechanism,msa_1975621741
"Our approach is inspired by the long-established practice of photographers using contact sheets to rapidly visualize a new collection of photographs , and then selecting a subset on which to focus attention",Mechanism,msa_1975621741
"On behalf of each smartphone , the cloud maintains a virtual contact sheet of images that have been captured but not yet uploaded",Mechanism,msa_1975621741
The virtual contact sheet consists of a set of low-fidelity images as well as full or partial meta-data associated with each image,Mechanism,msa_1975621741
"If search processing on the cloud indicates that a particular low-fidelity object is relevant , then its full-fidelity image can be obtained just-in-time from the corresponding smartphone for further search processing or presentation to the user",Mechanism,msa_1975621741

Autonomous driving is likely to be the heart of urban transportation in the future,Background,msa_1976328863
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to increase the safety of passengers and also to make road trips shorter and more enjoyable,Background,msa_1976328863
"As the first steps toward these goals , many car manufacturers are investing in designing and equipping their vehicles with advanced driver-assist systems",Background,msa_1976328863
"Road intersections are considered to be serious bottlenecks of urban transportation , as more than 44 % of all reported crashes in U",Background,msa_1976328863
"occur within intersection areas which in turn lead to 8,500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year",Background,msa_1976328863
"Furthermore , the impact of road intersections on traffic delays leads to enormous waste of human and natural resources",Background,msa_1976328863
"In this paper , we therefore focus on intersection management in Intelligent Transportation Systems ( ITS ) research",Purpose,msa_1976328863
"In the future , when dealing with autonomous vehicles , it is critical to address safety and throughput concerns that arise from autonomous driving through intersections and roundabouts",Purpose,msa_1976328863
Our goal is to provide vehicles with a safe and efficient passage method through intersections and roundabouts,Purpose,msa_1976328863
We have been investigating vehicle-to-vehicle ( V2V ) communications as a part of co-operative driving in the context of autonomous driving,Method,msa_1976328863
We have designed and developed efficient and reliable intersection protocols,Mechanism,msa_1976328863
to avoid vehicle collisions at intersections and increase traffic throughput,Purpose,msa_1976328863
"In this paper , we introduce new V2V intersection protocols",Mechanism,msa_1976328863
to achieve the above goals,Purpose,msa_1976328863
"We show that , in addition to intersections , these protocols are also applicable to vehicle crossings at roundabouts",Findings,msa_1976328863
"Additionally , we study the effects of position inaccuracy of commonly-used GPS devices on some of our V2V intersection protocols",Method,msa_1976328863
and suggest required modifications,Mechanism,msa_1976328863
to guarantee their safety and efficiency despite these impairments,Purpose,msa_1976328863
Our simulation,Method,msa_1976328863
Parameterized probabilistic complex computational ( P 2 C 2 ) models are being increasingly used in computational systems biology for analyzing biological systems,Background,msa_1976579277
"A key challenge is to build mechanistic P 2 C 2 models by combining prior knowledge and empirical data , given that certain system properties are unknown",Background,msa_1976579277
These unknown components are incorporated into a model as parameters and determining their values has traditionally been a process of trial and error,Purpose,msa_1976579277
We present a new algorithmic procedure,Mechanism,msa_1976579277
for discovering parameters in agent-based models of biological systems against behavioral specifications mined from large data-sets,Purpose,msa_1976579277
"Our approach uses Bayesian model checking , sequential hypothesis testing , and stochastic optimization to synthesize parameters of P 2 C 2 models",Mechanism,msa_1976579277
We demonstrate our algorithm by discovering the amount and schedule of doses of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in a clinical agent-based model of the dynamics of acute inflammation,Method,msa_1976579277
"In this paper , we address the problem of jointly summarizing large sets of Flickr images and YouTube videos",Purpose,msa_1976806664
"Starting from the intuition that the characteristics of the two media types are different yet complementary , we develop a fast and easily-parallelizable approach",Mechanism,msa_1976806664
for creating not only high-quality video summaries but also novel structural summaries of online images as storyline graphs,Purpose,msa_1976806664
The storyline graphs can illustrate various events or activities associated with the topic in a form of a branching network,Mechanism,msa_1976806664
The video summarization is achieved by diversity ranking on the similarity graphs between images and video frames,Mechanism,msa_1976806664
The reconstruction of storyline graphs is formulated as the inference of sparse time-varying directed graphs from a set of photo streams with assistance of videos,Mechanism,msa_1976806664
"For evaluation , we collect the datasets of 20 outdoor activities , consisting of 2",Method,msa_1976806664
7M Flickr images and 16K YouTube videos,Method,msa_1976806664
"Due to the large-scale nature of our problem , we evaluate our algorithm via crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk",Method,msa_1976806664
"In our experiments ,",Method,msa_1976806664
"Although widely touted as a replacement for glass slides and microscopes in pathology , digital slides present major challenges in data storage , transmission , processing and interoperability",Background,msa_1977653087
"Since no universal data format is in widespread use for these images today , each vendor defines its own proprietary data formats , analysis tools , viewers and software libraries",Purpose,msa_1977653087
"This creates issues not only for pathologists , but also for interoperability",Purpose,msa_1977653087
"In this paper , we present the design and implementation of OpenSlide , a vendor-neutral C library",Mechanism,msa_1977653087
for reading and manipulating digital slides of diverse vendor formats,Purpose,msa_1977653087
The library is extensible and easily interfaced to various programming languages,Mechanism,msa_1977653087
An application written to the OpenSlide interface,Method,msa_1977653087
can transparently handle multiple vendor formats,Findings,msa_1977653087
"Smartwatches are a promising new interactive platform , but their small size makes even basic actions cumbersome",Purpose,msa_1978180095
"Hence , there is a great need for approaches that expand the interactive envelope around smartwatches , allowing human input to escape the small physical confines of the device",Purpose,msa_1978180095
We propose using tiny projectors integrated into the smartwatch,Mechanism,msa_1978180095
to render icons on the user 's skin,Purpose,msa_1978180095
"These icons can be made touch sensitive , significantly expanding the interactive region without increasing device size",Mechanism,msa_1978180095
"Through a series of experiments ,",Method,msa_1978180095

In this paper we introduce High Assurance SPIRAL,Mechanism,msa_1978661190
to solve the last mile problem for the synthesis of high assurance implementations of controllers for vehicular systems that are executed in todays and future embedded and high performance embedded system processors,Purpose,msa_1978661190
"High Assurance SPIRAL is a scalable methodology to translate a high level specification of a high assurance controller into a highly resource-efficient , platform-adapted , verified control software implementation for a given platform in a language like C or C++",Mechanism,msa_1978661190
High Assurance SPIRAL proves that the implementation is equivalent to the specification written in the control engineers domain language,Mechanism,msa_1978661190
Our approach scales to problems involving floating-point calculations and provides highly optimized synthesized code,Mechanism,msa_1978661190
"It is possible to estimate the available headroom to enable assurance/performance trade-offs under real-time constraints , and enables the synthesis of multiple implementation variants to make attacks harder",Mechanism,msa_1978661190
At the core of High Assurance SPIRAL is the Hybrid Control Operator Language ( HCOL ) that leverages advanced mathematical constructs expressing the controller specification to provide high quality translation capabilities,Mechanism,msa_1978661190
"Combined with a verified/certified compiler , High Assurance SPIRAL provides a comprehensive complete solution to the efficient synthesis of verifiable high assurance controllers",Mechanism,msa_1978661190
We demonstrate High Assurance SPIRALs capability,Findings,msa_1978661190

The robust detection of small targets is one of the key techniques in infrared search and tracking applications,Purpose,msa_1978993121
A novel small target detection method in a single infrared image is proposed in this paper,Mechanism,msa_1978993121
"Initially , the traditional infrared image model is generalized to a new infrared patch-image model using local patch construction",Mechanism,msa_1978993121
"Then , because of the non-local self-correlation property of the infrared background image , based on the new model small target detection is formulated as an optimization problem of recovering low-rank and sparse matrices , which is effectively solved using stable principle component pursuit",Mechanism,msa_1978993121
"Finally , a simple adaptive segmentation method is used to segment the target image and the segmentation result can be refined by post-processing",Mechanism,msa_1978993121
Extensive synthetic and real data experiments,Method,msa_1978993121
"In this paper , we investigate a time-sensitive image retrieval problem ,",Purpose,msa_1979433017
"in which given a query keyword , a query time point , and optionally user information , we retrieve the most relevant and temporally suitable images from the database",Mechanism,msa_1979433017
"Inspired by recently emerging interests on query dynamics in information retrieval research , our time-sensitive image retrieval algorithm can infer users ' implicit search intent better and provide more engaging and diverse search results according to temporal trends of Web user photos",Mechanism,msa_1979433017
"We model observed image streams as instances of multivariate point processes represented by several different descriptors , and develop a regularized multi-task regression framework that automatically selects and learns stochastic parametric models to solve the relations between image occurrence probabilities and various temporal factors that influence them",Mechanism,msa_1979433017
Using Flickr datasets of more than seven million images of 30 topics,Method,msa_1979433017
"As part of a collaboration with a major California school district ,",Background,msa_1979765269
we study the problem of fairly allocating unused classrooms in public schools to charter schools,Purpose,msa_1979765269
Our approach revolves around the randomized leximin mechanism,Mechanism,msa_1979765269
"We extend previous work to the classroom allocation setting , showing that the leximin mechanism is proportional , envy-free , efficient , and group strategyproof",Mechanism,msa_1979765269
We also prove that the leximin mechanism provides a ( worst-case ) 4-approximation to the maximum number of classrooms that can possibly be allocated,Mechanism,msa_1979765269
"Our experiments , which are based on real data ,",Method,msa_1979765269
"show that a nontrivial implementation of the leximin mechanism scales gracefully in terms of running time ( even though the problem is intractable in theory ) , and performs extremely well with respect to a number of efficiency objectives",Findings,msa_1979765269
This paper studies the convergence of the estimation error process and the characterization of the corresponding invariant measure in distributed Kalman filtering for potentially unstable and large linear dynamic systems,Purpose,msa_1980151944
"A gossip network protocol termed Modified Gossip Interactive Kalman Filtering ( M-GIKF ) is proposed , where sensors exchange their filtered states ( estimates and error covariances ) and propagate their observations via inter-sensor communications of rate $ \overline { \gamma } $ ; $ \overline { \gamma } $ is defined as the averaged number of inter-sensor message passages per signal evolution epoch",Mechanism,msa_1980151944
The filtered states are interpreted as stochastic particles swapped through local interaction,Mechanism,msa_1980151944
The paper shows that the conditional estimation error covariance sequence at each sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random Riccati equation ( RRE ) with Markov modulated switching,Mechanism,msa_1980151944
"By formulating the RRE as a random dynamical system ,",Method,msa_1980151944
"it is shown that the network achieves weak consensus , i",Findings,msa_1980151944
", the conditional estimation error covariance at a randomly selected sensor converges weakly ( in distribution ) to a unique invariant measure",Findings,msa_1980151944
"Further , it is proved that as $ \overline { \gamma } \rightarrow \infty $ this invariant measure satisfies the Large Deviation ( LD ) upper and lower bounds , implying that this measure converges exponentially fast ( in probability ) to the Dirac measure $ \delta_ { P^* } $ , where $ P^* $ is the stable error covariance of the centralized ( Kalman ) filtering setup",Findings,msa_1980151944
"Given a set of k networks , possibly with different sizes and no overlaps in nodes or links , how can we quickly assess similarity between them ? Analogously , are there a set of social theories which , when represented by a small number of descriptive , numerical features , effectively serve as a `` signature '' for the network ?",Background,msa_1980331354
"Having such signatures will enable a wealth of graph mining and social network analysis tasks , including clustering , outlier detection , visualization , etc",Purpose,msa_1980331354
"We propose a novel , effective , and scalable method , called NETSIMILE ,",Mechanism,msa_1980331354
for solving the above problem,Purpose,msa_1980331354
Our approach has the following desirable properties : ( a ) It is supported by a set of social theories,Mechanism,msa_1980331354
( b ) It gives similarity scores that are size-invariant,Mechanism,msa_1980331354
"( c ) It is scalable , being linear on the number of links for graph signature extraction",Mechanism,msa_1980331354
"In extensive experiments on numerous synthetic and real networks from disparate domains ,",Method,msa_1980331354
NETSIMILE outperforms baseline competitors,Findings,msa_1980331354
We also demonstrate how,Method,msa_1980331354
"Short-term forecasting is a ubiquitous practice in a wide range of energy systems , including forecasting demand , renewable generation , and electricity pricing",Background,msa_1980746328
"Although it is known that probabilistic forecasts ( which give a distribution over possible future outcomes ) can improve planning and control , many forecasting systems in practice are just used as point forecast tools , as it is challenging to represent high-dimensional non-Gaussian distributions over multiple spatial and temporal points",Purpose,msa_1980746328
"In this paper , we apply a recently-proposed algorithm for modeling high-dimensional conditional Gaussian distributions to forecasting wind power and extend it to the non-Gaussian case using the copula transform",Mechanism,msa_1980746328
"On a wind power forecasting task ,",Method,msa_1980746328
The omnipresence of indoor lighting makes it an ideal vehicle for pervasive communication with mobile devices,Background,msa_1980935581
"In this paper , we present a communication scheme that enables interior ambient LED lighting systems",Mechanism,msa_1980935581
to send data to mobile devices,Purpose,msa_1980935581
using either cameras or light sensors,Mechanism,msa_1980935581
"By exploiting rolling shutter camera sensors that are common on tablets , laptops and smartphones , it is possible to detect high-frequency changes in light intensity reflected off of surfaces and in direct line-of-sight of the camera",Mechanism,msa_1980935581
We present a demodulation approach that allows smartphones to accurately detect frequencies as high as 8kHz with 0,Mechanism,msa_1980935581
2kHz channel separation,Mechanism,msa_1980935581
"In order to avoid humanly perceivable flicker in the lighting , our system operates at frequencies above 2kHz and compensates for the non-ideal frequency response of standard LED drivers by adjusting the light 's duty-cycle",Mechanism,msa_1980935581
"By modulating the PWM signal commonly used to drive LED lighting systems , we are able to encode data that can be used as localization landmarks",Mechanism,msa_1980935581
We show,Findings,msa_1980935581
through experiments,Method,msa_1980935581
"With the rapid increase in cloud services collecting and using user data to offer personalized experiences , ensuring that these services comply with their privacy policies has become a business imperative for building user trust",Background,msa_1981490327
"However , most compliance efforts in industry today rely on manual review processes and audits designed to safeguard user data , and therefore are resource intensive and lack coverage",Purpose,msa_1981490327
"In this paper , we present our experience building and operating a system",Mechanism,msa_1981490327
to automate privacy policy compliance checking in Bing,Purpose,msa_1981490327
Central to the design of the system are ( a ) Legal ease-a language,Mechanism,msa_1981490327
that allows specification of privacy policies,Purpose,msa_1981490327
"that impose restrictions on how user data is handled , and ( b ) Grok-a data inventory for Map-Reduce-like big data systems",Mechanism,msa_1981490327
that tracks how user data flows,Purpose,msa_1981490327
among programs,Mechanism,msa_1981490327
"Grok maps code-level schema elements to data types in Legal ease , in essence , annotating existing programs with information flow types with minimal human input",Mechanism,msa_1981490327
Compliance checking is thus reduced to information flow analysis of big data systems,Mechanism,msa_1981490327
Question answering ( Q & A ) communities have been gaining popularity in the past few years,Background,msa_1981552292
"The success of such sites depends mainly on the contribution of a small number of expert users who provide a significant portion of the helpful answers ,",Background,msa_1981552292
and so identifying users that have the potential of becoming strong contributers is an important task for owners of such communities,Purpose,msa_1981552292
"We present a study of the popular Q & A website StackOverflow ( SO ) , in which users ask and answer questions about software development , algorithms , math and other technical topics",Method,msa_1981552292
The dataset includes information on 3,Method,msa_1981552292
5 million questions and 6,Method,msa_1981552292
9 million answers created by 1,Method,msa_1981552292
3 million users in the years 2008 -- 2012,Method,msa_1981552292
"Participation in activities on the site ( such as asking and answering questions ) earns users reputation , which is an indicator of the value of that user to the site",Method,msa_1981552292
"We describe an analysis of the SO reputation system , and the participation patterns of high and low reputation users",Method,msa_1981552292
"The contributions of very high reputation users to the site indicate that they are the primary source of answers , and especially of high quality answers",Method,msa_1981552292
"Interestingly , we find that while the majority of questions on the site are asked by low reputation users , on average a high reputation user asks more questions than a user with low reputation",Findings,msa_1981552292
We consider a number of graph analysis methods,Mechanism,msa_1981552292
"for detecting influential and anomalous users in the underlying user interaction network ,",Purpose,msa_1981552292
and find they are effective in detecting extreme behaviors such as those of spam users,Findings,msa_1981552292
"Lastly , we show an application of our analysis : by considering user contributions over first months of activity on the site ,",Method,msa_1981552292
"In a series of experiments ,",Method,msa_1981568085
we examined how the timing impacts the salience of smartphone app privacy notices,Purpose,msa_1981568085
"In a web survey and a field experiment , we isolated different timing conditions for displaying privacy notices : in the app store , when an app is started , during app use , and after app use",Method,msa_1981568085
"Participants installed and played a history quiz app , either virtually or on their phone",Method,msa_1981568085
After a distraction or delay they were asked to recall the privacy notice 's content,Method,msa_1981568085
Recall was used as a proxy for the attention paid to and salience of the notice,Method,msa_1981568085
Showing the notice during app use significantly increased recall rates over showing it in the app store,Findings,msa_1981568085
"In a follow-up web survey , we tested alternative app store notices ,",Method,msa_1981568085
which improved recall but did not perform as well as notices shown during app use,Findings,msa_1981568085
"In commercial-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) multi-core systems , a task running on one core can be delayed by other tasks running simultaneously on other cores due to interference in the shared DRAM main memory",Background,msa_1981588964
"Such memory interference delay can be large and highly variable , thereby posing a significant challenge for the design of predictable real-time systems",Purpose,msa_1981588964
"In this paper , we present techniques",Mechanism,msa_1981588964
to provide a tight upper bound on the worst-case memory interference,Purpose,msa_1981588964
in a COTS-based multi-core system,Mechanism,msa_1981588964
"We explicitly model the major resources in the DRAM system , including banks , buses and the memory controller",Mechanism,msa_1981588964
"By considering their timing characteristics , we analyze the worst-case memory interference delay imposed on a task by other tasks running in parallel",Mechanism,msa_1981588964
"To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work bounding the request re-ordering effect of COTS memory controllers",Mechanism,msa_1981588964
Our work also enables the quantification of the extent by which memory interference can be reduced by partitioning DRAM banks,Mechanism,msa_1981588964

"Virus capsid assembly has been widely studied as a biophysical system , both for its biological and medical significance and as an important model for complex self-assembly processes",Background,msa_1981745757
No current technology can monitor assembly in detail and what information we have on assembly kinetics comes exclusively from invitro studies,Background,msa_1981745757
"There are many differences between the intracellular environment and that of an invitro assembly assay , however , that might be expected to alter assembly pathways",Background,msa_1981745757
"Here , we explore one specific feature characteristic of the intracellular environment and known to have large effects on macromolecular assembly processes : molecular crowding",Purpose,msa_1981745757
"We combine prior particle simulation methods for estimating crowding effects with coarse-grained stochastic models of capsid assembly , using the crowding models to adjust kinetics of capsid simulations",Mechanism,msa_1981745757
to examine possible effects of crowding on assembly pathways,Purpose,msa_1981745757
"Simulations suggest a striking difference depending on whether or not a system uses nucleation-limited assembly , with crowding tending to promote off-pathway growth in a nonnucleation-limited model but often enhancing assembly efficiency at high crowding levels even while impeding it at lower crowding levels in a nucleation-limited model",Findings,msa_1981745757
Understanding and quantifying the impact of unobserved processes is one of the major challenges of analyzing multivariate time series data,Purpose,msa_1982541060
"In this paper , we analyze a flexible stochastic process model , the generalized linear auto-regressive process ( GLARP ) and identify the conditions under which the impact of hidden variables appears as an additive term to the evolution matrix estimated with the maximum likelihood",Method,msa_1982541060
"In particular , we examine three examples , including two popular models for count data , i",Method,msa_1982541060
"e , Poisson and Conwey-Maxwell Poisson vector auto-regressive processes , and one powerful model for extreme value data , i",Method,msa_1982541060
", Gumbel vector auto-regressive processes",Method,msa_1982541060
We demonstrate that the impact of hidden factors can be separated out via convex optimization in these three models,Findings,msa_1982541060

"However , if two crossmatches could be performed per patient , in principle significantly more successful exchanges could take place",Purpose,msa_1982749114

The Internet has the potential to accelerate scientific problem solving by engaging a global pool of contributors,Background,msa_1982759407

Recent computer systems research has proposed using redundant requests to reduce latency,Background,msa_1983964956
The idea is to run a request on multiple servers and wait for the first completion ( discarding all remaining copies of the request ),Background,msa_1983964956
However there is no exact analysis of systems with redundancy,Purpose,msa_1983964956
This paper presents the first exact analysis of systems with redundancy,Purpose,msa_1983964956
"We allow for any number of classes of redundant requests , any number of classes of non-redundant requests , any degree of redundancy , and any number of heterogeneous servers",Method,msa_1983964956
In all cases we derive the limiting distribution on the state of the system,Method,msa_1983964956
"In small ( two or three server ) systems , we derive simple forms for the distribution of response time of both the redundant classes and non-redundant classes , and we quantify the `` gain '' to redundant classes and `` pain '' to non-redundant classes caused by redundancy",Method,msa_1983964956
We find some surprising results,Findings,msa_1983964956
"First , the response time of a fully redundant class follows a simple Exponential distribution and that of the non-redundant class follows a Generalized Hyperexponential",Findings,msa_1983964956
"Second , fully redundant classes are `` immune '' to any pain caused by other classes becoming redundant",Findings,msa_1983964956

"In this paper , we investigate an approach",Mechanism,msa_1984899418
"for reconstructing storyline graphs from large-scale collections of Internet images , and optionally other side information such as friendship graphs",Purpose,msa_1984899418
The storyline graphs can be an effective summary that visualizes various branching narrative structure of events or activities recurring across the input photo sets of a topic class,Mechanism,msa_1984899418
"In order to explore further the usefulness of the storyline graphs ,",Purpose,msa_1984899418
"we leverage them to perform the image sequential prediction tasks , from which photo recommendation applications can benefit",Mechanism,msa_1984899418
"We formulate the storyline reconstruction problem as an inference of sparse time-varying directed graphs , and develop an optimization algorithm that successfully addresses a number of key challenges of Web-scale problems , including global optimality , linear complexity , and easy parallelization",Mechanism,msa_1984899418

"states from 1888 to 2013 , for 56 contagious diseases ( e",Background,msa_1985164990
", measles , influenza ) , which include missing values , possible recording errors , sudden spikes ( or dives ) of infections , etc",Background,msa_1985164990
"So how can we find a combined model , for all these diseases , locations , and time-ticks ?",Purpose,msa_1985164990
"In this paper , we present FUNNEL , a unifying analytical model",Mechanism,msa_1985164990
"for large scale epidemiological data ,",Purpose,msa_1985164990
"as well as a novel fitting algorithm , FUNNELFIT ,",Mechanism,msa_1985164990
which solves the above problem,Purpose,msa_1985164990
"Our method has the following properties : ( a ) Sense-making : it detects important patterns of epidemics , such as periodicities , the appearance of vaccines , external shock events , and more ; ( b ) Parameter-free : our modeling framework frees the user from providing parameter values ; ( c ) Scalable : FUNNELFIT is carefully designed to be linear on the input size ; ( d ) General : our model is general and practical , which can be applied to various types of epidemics , including computer-virus propagation , as well as human diseases",Mechanism,msa_1985164990
Extensive experiments on real data,Method,msa_1985164990
"From Twitter to Facebook to Reddit , users have become accustomed to sharing the articles they read with friends or followers on their social networks",Background,msa_1985198985
"While previous work has modeled what these shared stories say about the user who shares them , the converse question remains unexplored : what can we learn about an article from the identities of its likely readers ? To address this question ,",Purpose,msa_1985198985
we model the content of news articles and blog posts by attributes of the people who are likely to share them,Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"For example , many Twitter users describe themselves in a short profile , labeling themselves with phrases such as `` vegetarian '' or `` liberal",Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"'' By assuming that a user 's labels correspond to topics in the articles he shares , we can learn a labeled dictionary from a training corpus of articles shared on Twitter",Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"Thereafter , we can code any new document as a sparse non-negative linear combination of user labels , where we encourage correlated labels to appear together in the output via a structured sparsity penalty",Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"Finally , we show that our approach yields a novel document representation that can be effectively used in many problem settings , from recommendation to modeling news dynamics",Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"For example , while the top politics stories will change drastically from one month to the next , the `` politics '' label will still be there to describe them",Mechanism,msa_1985198985
"We evaluate our model on millions of tweeted news articles and blog posts collected between September 2010 and September 2012 ,",Method,msa_1985198985
"The M/M/k/setup model , where there is a penalty for turning servers on , is common in data centers , call centers , and manufacturing systems",Background,msa_1985865469
"Setup costs take the form of a time delay , and sometimes there is additionally a power penalty , as in the case of data centers",Background,msa_1985865469
"While the M/M/1/setup was exactly analyzed in 1964 , no exact analysis exists to date for the M/M/k/setup with $ $ k > 1 $ $ k > 1",Purpose,msa_1985865469
"In this paper , we provide the first exact , closed-form analysis for the M/M/k/setup and some of its important variants including systems in which idle servers delay for a period of time before turning off or can be put to sleep",Purpose,msa_1985865469
Our analysis is made possible,Method,msa_1985865469
Multimedia event detection ( MED ) is an effective technique for video indexing and retrieval,Background,msa_1986397799
Current classifier training for MED treats the negative videos equally,Purpose,msa_1986397799
"However , many negative videos may resemble the positive videos in different degrees",Purpose,msa_1986397799
"Intuitively , we may capture more informative cues from the negative videos if we assign them fine-grained labels , thus benefiting the classifier learning",Purpose,msa_1986397799
"Aiming for this ,",Purpose,msa_1986397799
we use a statistical method on both the positive and negative examples,Mechanism,msa_1986397799
to get the decisive attributes of a specific event,Purpose,msa_1986397799
"Based on these decisive attributes , we assign the fine-grained labels to negative examples to treat them differently for more effective exploitation",Mechanism,msa_1986397799
The resulting fine-grained labels may be not accurate enough to characterize the negative videos,Mechanism,msa_1986397799
"Hence , we propose to jointly optimize the fine-grained labels with the knowledge from the visual features and the attributes representations , which brings mutual reciprocality",Mechanism,msa_1986397799
"Our model obtains two kinds of classifiers , one from the attributes and one from the features , which incorporate the informative cues from the fine-grained labels",Mechanism,msa_1986397799
The outputs of both classifiers on the testing videos are fused for detection,Mechanism,msa_1986397799
Extensive experiments on the challenging TRECVID MED 2012 development set,Method,msa_1986397799
"Autonomous driving technologies have been emerging over the past few years , and semi-autonomous driving functionalities have been deployed to vehicles available in the market",Background,msa_1986583733
"Since autonomous driving is realized by the intelligent processing of data from various types of sensors such as LIDAR , radar , camera , etc",Background,msa_1986583733
", the complexity of designing a dependable real-time autonomous driving system is rather high",Background,msa_1986583733
"Although there has been much research on building a reliable real-time system using hardware replication , the resulting systems tend to add significant extra cost due to hardware replication",Background,msa_1986583733
"Therefore , an alternative solution would be helpful in building an autonomous vehicle in a cost-effective way",Purpose,msa_1986583733
"An autonomous driving system is different from the conventional reliable real-time system because it requires ( 1 ) flexible design , ( 2 ) adaptive graceful degradation and ( 3 ) effective use of different modalities of sensors and actuators",Purpose,msa_1986583733
"To address these characteristics ,",Purpose,msa_1986583733
we summarize SAFER ( System-level Architecture for Failure Evasion in Real-time applications ) our previous work on flexible system design,Background,msa_1986583733
We then present a conceptual framework for autonomous vehicles,Mechanism,msa_1986583733

Coding behavioral video is an important method used by researchers to understand social phenomenon,Background,msa_1987118995
"Unfortunately , traditional hand-coding approaches can take days or weeks of time to complete",Purpose,msa_1987118995
Recent work has shown that these tasks can be completed quickly by leveraging the parallelism of large online crowds,Background,msa_1987118995
", but using the crowd introduces new concerns about accuracy , reliability , privacy , and cost",Purpose,msa_1987118995
"To explore these issues ,",Purpose,msa_1987118995
"we conducted interviews with 12 researchers who frequently code behavioral video ,",Method,msa_1987118995
to investigate common practices and challenges with video coding,Purpose,msa_1987118995
We find accuracy and privacy to be the researchers ' primary concerns,Findings,msa_1987118995
"To explore this more concretely ,",Purpose,msa_1987118995
we used sample videos,Method,msa_1987118995
to investigate whether crowds can accurately recognize instances of commonly coded behaviors,Purpose,msa_1987118995
", and show that the crowd yields accurate results",Findings,msa_1987118995
"Then , we demonstrate a method for obfuscating participant identity with a video blur filter ,",Mechanism,msa_1987118995
"and find , as expected , that workers ' ability to identify participants decreases as blur level increases",Findings,msa_1987118995
"The workers ' ability to accurately and reliably code behaviors also decreases , but not as steeply as the identity test",Findings,msa_1987118995
"For pipe guided wave inspection systems , it can often be difficult to achieve accurate localization performance due to the pipe 's geometry",Background,msa_1987395033
"Many localization techniques focus on the first arrival for processing , but this often results in a poor circumferential resolution",Background,msa_1987395033
"Furthermore , the pipe 's circular geometry generates multipath arrivals that make data interpretation difficult",Background,msa_1987395033
"In this paper , however , we utilize this multipath behavior",Purpose,msa_1987395033
by combining the standard delay-and-sum localization method with a simple multipath model for a pipe,Mechanism,msa_1987395033

If Lisa visits Dr,Background,msa_1987764636
"Brown , and there is no record of the drug he prescribed her , can we find it ? Data sources , much to analysts ' dismay , are too often plagued with incompleteness , making business analytics over the data difficult",Background,msa_1987764636
"Data entries with incomplete values are ignored , making some analytic queries fail to accurately describe how an organization is performing",Purpose,msa_1987764636
"We introduce a principled way of performing value imputation on missing values , allowing a user",Mechanism,msa_1987764636
to choose a correct value after viewing possible values and why they were inferred,Purpose,msa_1987764636
A cognitive assistance application combines a wearable device such as Google Glass with cloudlet processing to provide step-by-step guidance on a complex task,Background,msa_1988175327
"In this paper , we focus on user assistance",Mechanism,msa_1988175327

"We describe proof-of-concept implementations for four different tasks : assembling 2D Lego models , freehand sketching , playing ping-pong , and recommending context-relevant YouTube tutorials",Mechanism,msa_1988175327
The utilization of Building Information Modeling ( BIM ) has been growing significantly and translating into the support of various tasks within the construction industry,Background,msa_1988887698
"In relation to such a growth , many approaches that leverage dimensions of information stored in BIM model are being developed",Background,msa_1988887698
"Through this , it is possible to allow all stakeholders to retrieve and generate information from the same model , enabling them to work cohesively",Background,msa_1988887698
"To identify gaps of existing work and evaluate new studies in this area ,",Purpose,msa_1988887698
a BIM application framework is developed and discussed in this paper,Mechanism,msa_1988887698
Such a framework gives an overview of BIM applications in the construction industry,Mechanism,msa_1988887698
"A literature review , within this framework , has been conducted",Method,msa_1988887698
"and the result reveals a research gap for BIM applications in the project domains of quality , safety and environmental management",Findings,msa_1988887698
"A computable multi-dimensional ( nD ) model is difficult to establish in these areas because with continuously changing conditions , the decision making rules for evaluating whether an individual component is considered good quality , or whether a construction site is safe , also vary as the construction progresses",Mechanism,msa_1988887698
"A process of expanding from 3D to computable nD models , specifically , a possible way to integrate safety , quality and carbon emission variables into BIM during the construction phase of a project is explained in this paper",Mechanism,msa_1988887698
"As examples , the processes of utilizing nD models on real construction sites are described",Method,msa_1988887698
Let us consider that someone is starting a research on a topic that is unfamiliar to them,Background,msa_1989063802
"Which seminal papers have influenced the topic the most ? What is the genealogy of the seminal papers in this topic ? These are the questions that they can raise , which we try to answer in this paper",Purpose,msa_1989063802
"First , we propose an algorithm",Mechanism,msa_1989063802
that finds a set of seminal papers on a given topic,Purpose,msa_1989063802
We also address the performance and scalability issues of this sophisticated algorithm,Mechanism,msa_1989063802
"Next , we discuss the measures to decide how much a paper is influenced by another paper",Mechanism,msa_1989063802

Online social networks and the World Wide Web lead to large underlying graphs that might not be completely known because of their size,Background,msa_1989717406
"To compute reliable statistics , we have to resort to sampling the network",Background,msa_1989717406

"As kidney exchange programs are growing , manipulation by hospitals becomes more of an issue",Background,msa_1989795702
"Assuming that hospitals wish to maximize the number of their own patients who receive a kidney , they may have an incentive to withhold some of their incompatible donorpatient pairs and match them internally , thus harming social welfare",Purpose,msa_1989795702

"AbstractVulnerability assessment serves to identify vulnerabilities , develop responses , and drive the risk-management process",Background,msa_1990785468
"In identifying vulnerabilities , it is fundamental to identify and rank critical assets , which include vital systems , facilities , processes , and information necessary to maintain continuity of service",Background,msa_1990785468
"During emergencies in the facility management domain , first responders typically search for critical assets , both related to business continuity and value to the organization",Background,msa_1990785468

Data locality and parallelism are critical optimization objectives for performance on modern multi-core machines,Background,msa_1991009705
Both coarse-grain parallelism ( e,Purpose,msa_1991009705
", multi-core ) and fine-grain parallelism ( e",Purpose,msa_1991009705
", vector SIMD ) must be effectively exploited , but despite decades of progress at both ends , current compiler optimization schemes that attempt to address data locality and both kinds of parallelism often fail at one of the three objectives",Purpose,msa_1991009705
We address this problem,Purpose,msa_1991009705
"by proposing a 3-step framework , which",Mechanism,msa_1991009705
"aims for integrated data locality , multi-core parallelism and SIMD execution of programs",Purpose,msa_1991009705
"We define the concept of vectorizable codelets , with properties tailored to achieve effective SIMD code generation for the codelets",Mechanism,msa_1991009705
"We leverage the power of a modern high-level transformation framework to restructure a program to expose good ISA-independent vectorizable codelets , exploiting multi-dimensional data reuse",Mechanism,msa_1991009705

Abstract Guided wave ultrasonics is an attractive monitoring technique for damage diagnosis in large-scale plate and pipe structures,Background,msa_1991033446
Damage can be detected by comparing incoming records with baseline records collected on intact structure,Background,msa_1991033446
"However , during long-term monitoring , environmental and operational conditions often vary significantly and produce large changes in the ultrasonic signals , thereby challenging the baseline comparison based damage detection",Purpose,msa_1991033446
"Researchers developed temperature compensation methods to eliminate the effects of temperature variation , but they have limitations in practical implementations",Background,msa_1991033446
"In this paper , we develop a robust damage detection method based on singular value decomposition ( SVD )",Mechanism,msa_1991033446
We show that the orthogonality of singular vectors ensures that the effect of damage and that of environmental and operational variations are separated into different singular vectors,Mechanism,msa_1991033446
We report on our field ultrasonic monitoring of a 273,Method,msa_1991033446

We propose a non-intrusive approach,Mechanism,msa_1991080689

"In social settings , individuals interact through webs of relationships",Background,msa_1991252559
"Each individual is a node in a complex network ( or graph ) of interdependencies and generates data , lots of data",Purpose,msa_1991252559
"We label the data by its source , or formally stated , we index the data by the nodes of the graph",Mechanism,msa_1991252559
The resulting signals ( data indexed by the nodes ) are far removed from time or image signals indexed by well ordered time samples or pixels,Mechanism,msa_1991252559
"DSP , discrete signal processing , provides a comprehensive , elegant , and efficient methodology",Mechanism,msa_1991252559
"to describe , represent , transform , analyze , process , or synthesize these well ordered time or image signals",Purpose,msa_1991252559
Spatial Pyramid Matching ( SPM ) assumes that the spatial Bag-of-Words ( BoW ) representation is independent of data,Background,msa_1991772852
"However , evidence has shown that the assumption usually leads to a suboptimal representation",Purpose,msa_1991772852
"In this paper , we propose a novel method called Jensen-Shannon ( JS ) Tiling",Mechanism,msa_1991772852
to learn the BoW representation from data directly at the BoW level,Purpose,msa_1991772852
"The proposed JS Tiling is especially appropriate for large-scale datasets as it is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods , but with comparable or even better classification precision",Mechanism,msa_1991772852
Experimental results on four benchmarks including two TRECVID12 datasets,Method,msa_1991772852
We present the design and analysis of a nearly-linear work parallel algorithm,Mechanism,msa_1991838331
for solving symmetric diagonally dominant ( SDD ) linear systems,Purpose,msa_1991838331
"On input an SDD n-by-n matrix A with m nonzero entries and a vector b , our algorithm computes a vector $ \tilde { x } $ such that $ \|\tilde { x } - A^ { + } b\|_ { A } \leq\varepsilon\cdot\| { A^ { + } b } \|_ { A } $ in $ O ( m\log^ { O ( 1 ) } { n } \log { \frac { 1 } { \varepsilon } } ) $ work and $ O ( m^ { 1/3+\theta } \log\frac { 1 } { \varepsilon } ) $ depth for any ? > 0 , where A + denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of A",Mechanism,msa_1991838331
The algorithm relies on a parallel algorithm for generating low-stretch spanning trees or spanning subgraphs,Mechanism,msa_1991838331
"To this end , we first develop a parallel decomposition algorithm that in O ( mlog O ( 1 ) n ) work and polylogarithmic depth , partitions a graph with n nodes and m edges into components with polylogarithmic diameter such that only a small fraction of the original edges are between the components",Mechanism,msa_1991838331
This can be used to generate low-stretch spanning trees with average stretch O ( n ? ) in O ( mlog O ( 1 ) n ) work and O ( n ? ) depth for any ? > 0,Mechanism,msa_1991838331
"Alternatively , it can be used to generate spanning subgraphs with polylogarithmic average stretch in O ( mlog O ( 1 ) n ) work and polylogarithmic depth",Mechanism,msa_1991838331
We apply this subgraph construction to derive a parallel linear solver,Mechanism,msa_1991838331
"By using this solver in known applications ,",Method,msa_1991838331
our results,Findings,msa_1991838331
"Heating , Ventilation and Air-Conditioning ( HVAC ) systems account for more than 15 % of the total energy consumption in the US",Background,msa_1992449823
"In order to improve the energy efficiency of HVAC systems , researchers have developed hundreds of algorithms to automatically analyze their performance",Background,msa_1992449823
"However , the complex information , such as configurations of HVAC systems , layouts and materials of building elements and dynamic data from the control systems , required by these algorithms inhibits the process of deploying them in real-world facilities",Purpose,msa_1992449823
"To address this challenge ,",Purpose,msa_1992449823
we envision a framework that automatically integrates the required information items and provides them to the performance analysis algorithms for HVAC systems,Mechanism,msa_1992449823
This paper presents an approach,Mechanism,msa_1992449823
to identify and document the information requirements from the publications that describe these algorithms,Purpose,msa_1992449823
We extend the Information Delivery Manual ( IDM ) approach so that the identified information requirements can be mapped to multiple information sources that use various formats and schemas,Mechanism,msa_1992449823
A password composition policy restricts the space of allowable passwords to eliminate weak passwords that are vulnerable to statistical guessing attacks,Background,msa_1992851378
Usability studies have demonstrated that existing password composition policies can sometimes result in weaker password distributions ; hence a more principled approach is needed,Purpose,msa_1992851378
We introduce the first theoretical model,Mechanism,msa_1992851378
for optimizing password composition policies,Purpose,msa_1992851378
We study the computational and sample complexity of this problem under different assumptions on the structure of policies and on users ' preferences over passwords,Method,msa_1992851378
"Our main positive result is an algorithm that -- with high probability -- - constructs almost optimal policies ( which are specified as a union of subsets of allowed passwords ) , and requires only a small number of samples of users ' preferred passwords",Mechanism,msa_1992851378
We complement our,Method,msa_1992851378
theoretical results,Findings,msa_1992851378
Time synchronization in wireless sensor networks is important for event ordering and efficient communication scheduling,Background,msa_1992893634
"In this paper , we introduce an external hardwarebased clock tuning circuit that can be used",Mechanism,msa_1992893634
to improve synchronization and significantly reduce clock drift over long periods of time,Purpose,msa_1992893634
without waking up the host MCU,Mechanism,msa_1992893634
This is accomplished through two main hardware sub-systems,Mechanism,msa_1992893634
"First , we improve upon the circuit presented in [ 1 ] that synchronizes clocks using the ambient magnetic fields emitted from power lines",Mechanism,msa_1992893634
"The new circuit uses an electric field front-end as opposed to the original magnetic-field sensor , which makes the design more compact , lower-power , lower-cost , exhibit less jitter and improves robustness to noise generated by nearby appliances",Mechanism,msa_1992893634
"Second , we present a low-cost hardware tuning circuit that can be used to continuously trim a micro-controller 's low-power clock at runtime",Mechanism,msa_1992893634
Most time synchronization approaches require a CPU to periodically adjust internal counters to accommodate for clock drift,Mechanism,msa_1992893634
Periodic discrete updates can introduce interpolation errors as compared to continuous update approaches and they require the CPU to expend energy during these wake up periods,Mechanism,msa_1992893634
Our hardware-based external clock tuning circuit allows the main CPU to remain in a deep-sleep mode for extended periods while an external circuit compensates for clock drift,Mechanism,msa_1992893634
"Split fabrication , the process of splitting an IC into an untrusted and trusted tier , facilitates access to the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities available in the world without requiring disclosure of design intent",Background,msa_1992964615
"While researchers have investigated the security of logic blocks in the context of split fabrication , the security of IP blocks , another key component of an SoC , has not been examined",Purpose,msa_1992964615
"Our security analysis of IP block designs , specifically embedded memory and analog components ,",Method,msa_1992964615
shows that they are vulnerable to recognition attacks at the untrusted foundry due to the use of standardized floorplans and leaf cell layouts,Findings,msa_1992964615
We propose methodologies,Method,msa_1992964615
to design these blocks efficiently and securely,Purpose,msa_1992964615
In this paper we address the distributed estimation of a dynamic ( time varying ) random field,Purpose,msa_1994199352
"The dynamic field is globally observable ( by the entire sensor network ) , but not locally observable ( at each sensor )",Purpose,msa_1994199352
We present a distributed Kalman-type estimator such that,Mechanism,msa_1994199352
the estimate at each sensor is unbiased with bounded mean-squared estimation error,Purpose,msa_1994199352
"Self-powered vehicles that interact with the physical world , such as spacecraft , require computing platforms with predictable timing behavior and a low energy demand",Background,msa_1994349155
Energy consumption can be reduced by choosing energy-efficient designs for both hardware and software components of the platform,Background,msa_1994349155
We leverage the state-of-the-art in energy-efficient hardware design by adopting Heterogeneous Multi-core Processors with support for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling and Dynamic Power Management,Mechanism,msa_1994349155
We address the problem of allocating real-time software components onto heterogeneous cores such that total energy is minimized,Purpose,msa_1994349155
Our approach is to start from an analytically justified target load distribution and find a task assignment heuristic that approximates it,Mechanism,msa_1994349155
Our analysis,Method,msa_1994349155
"shows that neither balancing the load nor assigning all load to the cheapest core is the best load distribution strategy , unless the cores are extremely alike or extremely different",Findings,msa_1994349155
The optimal load distribution is then formulated as a solution to a convex optimization problem,Mechanism,msa_1994349155
A heuristic that approximates this load distribution and an alternative method that leverages the solution explicitly are proposed as viable task assignment methods,Mechanism,msa_1994349155
Harnessing crowds can be a powerful mechanism for increasing innovation,Background,msa_1994734668
"However , current approaches to crowd innovation rely on large numbers of contributors generating ideas independently in an unstructured way",Purpose,msa_1994734668
We introduce a new approach called distributed analogical idea generation,Mechanism,msa_1994734668
", which aims to make idea generation more effective and less reliant on chance",Purpose,msa_1994734668
"Drawing from the literature in cognitive science on analogy and schema induction , our approach decomposes the creative process in a structured way amenable to using crowds",Mechanism,msa_1994734668
In three experiments,Method,msa_1994734668
we show that distributed analogical idea generation leads to better ideas than example-based approaches,Findings,msa_1994734668
", and investigate the conditions under which crowds generate good schemas and ideas",Method,msa_1994734668

Reranking has been a focal technique in multimedia retrieval due to its efficacy in improving initial retrieval results,Background,msa_1995137594
"Current reranking methods , however , mainly rely on the heuristic weighting",Purpose,msa_1995137594
"In this paper , we propose a novel reranking approach called Self-Paced Reranking ( SPaR )",Mechanism,msa_1995137594
for multimodal data,Purpose,msa_1995137594
"As its name suggests , SPaR utilizes samples from easy to more complex ones in a self-paced fashion",Mechanism,msa_1995137594
SPaR is special in that it has a concise mathematical objective to optimize and useful properties that can be theoretically verified,Mechanism,msa_1995137594
"It on one hand offers a unified framework providing theoretical justifications for current reranking methods , and on the other hand generates a spectrum of new reranking schemes",Mechanism,msa_1995137594
This paper also advances the state-of-the-art self-paced learning research which potentially benefits applications in other fields,Mechanism,msa_1995137594
Experimental,Method,msa_1995137594
"Memory layout transformations via data reorganization are very common operations , which occur as a part of the computation or as a performance optimization in data-intensive applications",Background,msa_1995459649
"These operations require inefficient memory access patterns and roundtrip data movement through the memory hierarchy , failing to utilize the performance and energy-efficiency potentials of the memory subsystem",Purpose,msa_1995459649
This paper proposes a high-bandwidth and energy-efficient hardware accelerated memory layout transform ( HAMLeT ) system integrated within a 3D-stacked DRAM,Mechanism,msa_1995459649
"HAMLeT uses a low-overhead hardware that exploits the existing infrastructure in the logic layer of 3D-stacked DRAMs , and does not require any changes to the DRAM layers , yet it can fully exploit the locality and parallelism within the stack by implementing efficient layout transform algorithms",Mechanism,msa_1995459649
"We analyze matrix layout transform operations ( such as matrix transpose , matrix blocking and 3D matrix rotation )",Method,msa_1995459649
This paper reports on methods and results of an applied research project by a team consisting of SAIC and four universities,Background,msa_1995976200
"to develop , integrate , and evaluate new approaches to detect the weak signals characteristic of insider threats on organizations ' information systems",Purpose,msa_1995976200
Our system combines structural and semantic information from a real corporate database of monitored activity on their users ' computers,Mechanism,msa_1995976200
to detect independently developed red team inserts of malicious insider activities,Purpose,msa_1995976200
"We have developed and applied multiple algorithms for anomaly detection based on suspected scenarios of malicious insider behavior , indicators of unusual activities , high-dimensional statistical patterns , temporal sequences , and normal graph evolution",Mechanism,msa_1995976200
Algorithms and representations for dynamic graph processing provide the ability to scale as needed for enterprise-level deployments on real-time data streams,Mechanism,msa_1995976200
"We have also developed a visual language for specifying combinations of features , baselines , peer groups , time periods , and algorithms to detect anomalies suggestive of instances of insider threat behavior",Mechanism,msa_1995976200
We defined over 100 data features in seven categories,Findings,msa_1995976200
based on approximately 5,Method,msa_1995976200
"5 million actions per day from approximately 5,500 users",Method,msa_1995976200
"Support for multiple concurrent applications is an important enabler for promoting the use of sensor networks as an infrastructure technology , where multiple users can deploy their applications independently",Background,msa_1996165521
"In such a scenario , different applications on a node may transmit packets at distinct periods , causing the node to change from sleep to active state more often , which negatively impacts the energy consumption of the whole network",Background,msa_1996165521
"In this paper , we propose to batch the transmissions together",Purpose,msa_1996165521
by defining a harmonizing period to align the transmissions from multiple applications at periodic boundaries,Mechanism,msa_1996165521
This harmonizing period is then leveraged to design a protocol that coordinates the transmissions across nodes and provides real-time guarantees in a multi-hop network,Mechanism,msa_1996165521
"This protocol , which we call Network- Harmonized Scheduling ( NHS ) , takes advantage of the periodicity introduced to assign offsets to nodes at different hop-levels such that collisions are always avoided , and deterministic behavior is enforced",Mechanism,msa_1996165521
NHS is a light-weight and distributed protocol that does not require any global state-keeping mechanism,Mechanism,msa_1996165521
We implemented NHS on the Contiki operating system,Method,msa_1996165521
We describe a new algorithm,Mechanism,msa_1996532644
for computing the Voronoi diagram of a set of n points in constant-dimensional Euclidean space,Purpose,msa_1996532644
Color descriptors are one of the important features used in content-based image retrieval,Background,msa_1996534565
The dominant color descriptor ( DCD ) represents a few perceptually dominant colors in an image through color quantization,Background,msa_1996534565
"For image retrieval based on DCD , the earth movers distance ( EMD ) and the optimal color composition distance were proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two images",Background,msa_1996534565
"Although providing good retrieval results , both methods are too time-consuming to be used in a large image database",Purpose,msa_1996534565
"To solve the problem ,",Purpose,msa_1996534565
we propose a new distance function that calculates an approximate earth movers distance in linear time,Mechanism,msa_1996534565
"To calculate the dissimilarity in linear time , the proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color space",Mechanism,msa_1996534565
"To improve the accuracy , the proposed approach uses multiple curves and adjusts the color positions",Mechanism,msa_1996534565
"As a result , our approach achieves order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors",Mechanism,msa_1996534565
We have performed extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach,Method,msa_1996534565
"In previous work , we developed the scaled SIS process , which models the dynamics of SIS epidemics over networks",Background,msa_1997116660
"With the scaled SIS process , we can consider networks that are finite-sized and of arbitrary topology ( i",Background,msa_1997116660
", we are not restricted to specific classes of networks )",Background,msa_1997116660
We derived for the scaled SIS process a closed-form expression for the time-asymptotic probability distribution of the states of all the agents in the network,Background,msa_1997116660
This closed-form solution of the equilibrium distribution explicitly exhibits the underlying network topology through its adjacency matrix,Background,msa_1997116660
This paper determines which network configuration is the most probable,Purpose,msa_1997116660
"We prove that , for a range of epidemics parameters , this combinatorial problem leads to a submodular optimization problem , which is exactly solvable in polynomial time",Mechanism,msa_1997116660
"We relate the most-probable configuration to the network structure , in particular , to the existence of high density subgraphs",Mechanism,msa_1997116660
"Depending on the epidemics parameters , subset of agents may be more likely to be infected than others ; these more-vulnerable agents form subgraphs that are denser than the overall network",Mechanism,msa_1997116660
We illustrate our results,Findings,msa_1997116660
We propose a novel discrete signal processing framework,Mechanism,msa_1999870684
"for structured datasets that arise from social , economic , biological , and physical networks",Purpose,msa_1999870684
"Our framework extends traditional discrete signal processing theory to datasets with complex structure that can be represented by graphs , so that data elements are indexed by graph nodes and relations between elements are represented by weighted graph edges",Mechanism,msa_1999870684
"We interpret such datasets as signals on graphs , introduce the concept of graph filters for processing such signals , and discuss important properties of graph filters , including linearity , shift-invariance , and invertibility",Mechanism,msa_1999870684
We then demonstrate the application of graph filters to data classification by demonstrating that a classifier can be interpreted as an adaptive graph filter,Mechanism,msa_1999870684
Our experiments,Method,msa_1999870684
Semantic search in video is a novel and challenging problem in information and multimedia retrieval,Background,msa_1999970330
"Existing solutions are mainly limited to text matching , in which the query words are matched against the textual metadata generated by users",Purpose,msa_1999970330
This paper presents a state-of-the-art system for event search without any textual metadata or example videos,Mechanism,msa_1999970330
The system relies on substantial video content understanding and allows for semantic search over a large collection of videos,Mechanism,msa_1999970330
"The novelty and practicality is demonstrated by the evaluation in NIST TRECVID 2014 ,",Method,msa_1999970330
where the proposed system achieves the best performance,Findings,msa_1999970330

"In this work , we have proposed an Augmented Linear Discriminant Analysis ( ALDA ) approach",Mechanism,msa_2000781128
to identify identical twins,Purpose,msa_2000781128
"It learns a common subspace that not only can identify from which family the individual comes , but also can distinguish between individuals within the same family",Mechanism,msa_2000781128
We evaluate the ALDA against the traditional LDA approach for subspace learning on the Notre Dame twin database,Method,msa_2000781128
"Accurate inference of molecular and functional interactions among genes , especially in multicellular organisms such as Drosophila , often requires statistical analysis of correlations not only between the magnitudes of gene expressions , but also between their temporal-spatial patterns",Background,msa_2001135470
The ISH ( in-situ-hybridization ) -based gene expression micro-imaging technology offers an effective approach to perform large-scale spatial-temporal profiling of whole-body mRNA abundance,Background,msa_2001135470
"However , analytical tools for discovering gene interactions from such data remain an open challenge due to various reasons , including difficulties in extracting canonical representations of gene activities from images , and in inference of statistically meaningful networks from such representations",Purpose,msa_2001135470
"In this paper , we present GINI , a machine learning system",Mechanism,msa_2001135470
for inferring gene interaction networks from Drosophila embryonic ISH images,Purpose,msa_2001135470
"GINI builds on a computer-vision-inspired vector-space representation of the spatial pattern of gene expression in ISH images , enabled by our recently developed system ; and a new multi-instance-kernel algorithm that learns a sparse Markov network model , in which , every gene ( i",Mechanism,msa_2001135470
", node ) in the network is represented by a vector-valued spatial pattern rather than a scalar-valued gene intensity as in conventional approaches such as a Gaussian graphical model",Mechanism,msa_2001135470
"By capturing the notion of spatial similarity of gene expression , and at the same time properly taking into account the presence of multiple images per gene via multi-instance kernels , GINI is well-positioned to infer statistically sound , and biologically meaningful gene interaction networks from image data",Mechanism,msa_2001135470
"Using both synthetic data and a small manually curated data set ,",Method,msa_2001135470
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in network building,Findings,msa_2001135470
"Furthermore , we report results",Findings,msa_2001135470
on a large publicly available collection of Drosophila embryonic ISH images from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project,Method,msa_2001135470
", where GINI makes novel and interesting predictions of gene interactions",Findings,msa_2001135470
Background : Association analysis using genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) data investigates the effect that genetic variation has on cellular pathways and leads to the discovery of candidate regulators,Background,msa_2001637486
"Traditional analysis of eQTL data via pairwise statistical significance tests or linear regression does not leverage the availability of the structural information of the transcriptome , such as presence of gene networks that reveal correlation and potentially regulatory relationships among the study genes",Purpose,msa_2001637486
"We employ a new eQTL mapping algorithm , GFlasso , which we have previously developed for sparse structured regression ,",Mechanism,msa_2001637486
to reanalyze a genome-wide yeast dataset,Purpose,msa_2001637486
GFlasso fully takes into account the dependencies among expression traits to suppress false positives and to enhance the signal/noise ratio,Mechanism,msa_2001637486
"Thus , GFlasso leverages the gene-interaction network to discover the pleiotropic effects of genetic loci that perturb the expression level of multiple ( rather than individual ) genes , which enables us to gain more power in detecting previously neglected signals that are marginally weak but pleiotropically significant",Mechanism,msa_2001637486
"Results : While eQTL hotspots in yeast have been reported previously as genomic regions controlling multiple genes , our analysis reveals additional novel eQTL hotspots and , more interestingly , uncovers groups of multiple contributing eQTL hotspots that affect the expression level of functional gene modules",Findings,msa_2001637486
"To our knowledge , our study is the first to report this type of gene regulation stemming from multiple eQTL hotspots",Findings,msa_2001637486
"Additionally , we report the results",Findings,msa_2001637486
"from in-depth bioinformatics analysis for three groups of these eQTL hotspots : ribosome biogenesis , telomere silencing , and retrotransposon biology",Method,msa_2001637486
We suggest candidate regulators for the functional gene modules that map to each group of hotspots,Mechanism,msa_2001637486
"Not only do we find that many of these candidate regulators contain mutations in the promoter and coding regions of the genes , in the case of the Ribi group , we provide experimental evidence suggesting that the identified candidates do regulate the target genes predicted by GFlasso",Findings,msa_2001637486
"Conclusions : Thus , this structured association analysis of a yeast eQTL dataset via GFlasso , coupled with extensive bioinformatics analysis , discovers a novel regulation pattern between multiple eQTL hotspots and functional gene modules",Findings,msa_2001637486
"Human action may be observed from multi-view , which are highly related but sometimes look different from each other",Background,msa_2001690812
"Traditional metric learning algorithms have achieved satisfactory performance in single-view , but they often fail or do not satisfy when they are utilized to fuse different views",Purpose,msa_2001690812
"Thus , multi-view discriminative and structured dictionary learning with group sparsity and graph model ( GM-GS-DSDL ) is proposed to fuse different views and recognize human actions",Mechanism,msa_2001690812
"First , spatio-temporal interest points are extracted for each view , and then multi-view bag of words ( MVBoW ) representation is employed , at the same time , the graph model is also utilized to fuse different views , which will remove overlapped interest points to explore their consistency properties",Mechanism,msa_2001690812
"Furthermore , GM-GS-DSDL is formulated to discover the latent correlation among multiple views",Mechanism,msa_2001690812
"In addition , we also issue a new multi-view action dataset with RGB , depth and skeleton data ( called CVS-MV-RGBD )",Mechanism,msa_2001690812
Large-scale experimental results on multi-view IXMAX and CVS-MV-RGBD datasets,Method,msa_2001690812
"show that the exploring of consistency properties of different views by graph model is very useful , moreover , GM-GS-DSDL for each view , which are learnt simultaneously , can further improve the fusion performance",Findings,msa_2001690812
Comparative experiments,Method,msa_2001690812
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can obtain competing performance against the state-of-the-art methods,Findings,msa_2001690812
Objective,Purpose,msa_2004161355
"Analyzing and interpreting the activity of a heterogeneous population of neurons can be challenging , especially as the number of neurons , experimental trials , and experimental conditions increases",Background,msa_2004161355
One approach is to extract a set of latent variables that succinctly captures the prominent co-fluctuation patterns across the neural population,Background,msa_2004161355
"A key problem is that the number of latent variables needed to adequately describe the population activity is often greater than 3 , thereby preventing direct visualization of the latent space",Purpose,msa_2004161355
"By visualizing a small number of 2-d projections of the latent space or each latent variable individually , it is easy to miss salient features of the population activity",Purpose,msa_2004161355
Approach,Mechanism,msa_2004161355
To address this limitation,Purpose,msa_2004161355
", we developed a Matlab graphical user interface ( called DataHigh )",Mechanism,msa_2004161355
that allows the user to quickly and smoothly navigate through a continuum of different 2-d projections of the latent space,Purpose,msa_2004161355
"We also implemented a suite of additional visualization tools ( including playing out population activity timecourses as a movie and displaying summary statistics , such as covariance ellipses and average timecourses ) and an optional tool for performing dimensionality reduction",Mechanism,msa_2004161355
Main results,Findings,msa_2004161355
"To demonstrate the utility and versatility of DataHigh , we used it to analyze single-trial spike count and single-trial timecourse population activity recorded using a multi-electrode array , as well as trial-averaged population activity recorded using single electrodes",Method,msa_2004161355
Current applications have produced graphs on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges,Background,msa_2004422953
"To take advantage of such graphs , one must be able to find patterns , outliers , and communities",Background,msa_2004422953
"These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment , where human expertise can guide the process",Background,msa_2004422953
"For large graphs , though , there are some challenges : the excessive processing requirements are prohibitive , and drawing hundred-thousand nodes results in cluttered images hard to comprehend",Purpose,msa_2004422953
"To cope with these problems ,",Purpose,msa_2004422953
we propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visual design,Mechanism,msa_2004422953
GMine integrates 1 ) a representation for graphs organized as hierarchies of partitions-the concepts of SuperGraph and Graph-Tree ; and 2 ) a graph summarization methodology-CEPS,Mechanism,msa_2004422953
"Our graph representation deals with the problem of tracing the connection aspects of a graph hierarchy with sub linear complexity , allowing one to grasp the neighborhood of a single node or of a group of nodes in a single click",Mechanism,msa_2004422953
Many content-based video search ( CBVS ) systems have been proposed to analyze the rapidly-increasing amount of user-generated videos on the Internet,Background,msa_2004791968
"Though the accuracy of CBVS systems have drastically improved , these high accuracy systems tend to be too inefficient for interactive search",Purpose,msa_2004791968
"Therefore , to strive for real-time web-scale CBVS ,",Purpose,msa_2004791968
we perform a comprehensive study on the different components in a CBVS system,Method,msa_2004791968
to understand the trade-offs between accuracy and speed of each component,Purpose,msa_2004791968
"Directions investigated include exploring different low-level and semantics-based features , testing different compression factors and approximations during video search , and understanding the time v",Method,msa_2004791968
s,Method,msa_2004791968
accuracy trade-off of reranking,Method,msa_2004791968
"Extensive experiments on data sets consisting of more than 1,000 hours of video",Method,msa_2004791968
showed that,Findings,msa_2004791968
"through a combination of effective features , highly compressed representations , and one iteration of reranking , our proposed system",Mechanism,msa_2004791968
"can achieve an 10,000-fold speedup while retaining 80 % accuracy of a state-of-the-art CBVS system",Findings,msa_2004791968
We further performed search over 1 million videos and,Method,msa_2004791968
demonstrated that our system can complete the search in 0,Findings,msa_2004791968

We demonstrate a Visual Light Communication ( VLC ) system,Mechanism,msa_2006975835
that enables LED lighting luminaires to communicate with cameras on mobile devices,Purpose,msa_2006975835
Each LED pulses at a frequency above the humanly perceivable flicker threshold where cameras and photodiodes can still detect changes in light intensity,Mechanism,msa_2006975835
"Our modulation scheme supports multiple light sources in a single collision domain , and works for both , line-of-sight ( LOS ) operation as well as from reflected surfaces like those found in architectural lighting",Mechanism,msa_2006975835

"To reduce costs , organizations may outsource data storage and data processing to third-party clouds",Background,msa_2008426182
"This raises confidentiality concerns , since the outsourced data may have sensitive information",Background,msa_2008426182
"Although semantically secure encryption of the data prior to outsourcing alleviates these concerns , it also renders the outsourced data useless for any relational processing",Purpose,msa_2008426182
"Motivated by this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2008426182
we present two database encryption schemes that reveal just enough information about structured data,Mechanism,msa_2008426182
to support a wide-range of relational queries,Purpose,msa_2008426182
Our main contribution is a definition and proof of security for the two schemes,Mechanism,msa_2008426182
This definition captures confidentiality offered by the schemes using a novel notion of equivalence of databases from the adversary 's perspective,Mechanism,msa_2008426182

"In typical active learning scenarios , the number of labelled data in the seed set is usually small",Background,msa_2008989859
"However , most existing active learning algorithms only exploit the labelled data , which often suffers from over-fitting due to the small number of labelled examples",Purpose,msa_2008989859
"Besides , while much progress has been made in binary class active learning , little research attention has been focused on multi-class active learning",Purpose,msa_2008989859
"In this paper , we propose a semi-supervised batch mode multi-class active learning algorithm for visual concept recognition",Mechanism,msa_2008989859
Our algorithm exploits the whole active pool to evaluate the uncertainty of the data,Mechanism,msa_2008989859

"This paper proposes Halite , a novel , fast , and scalable clustering method",Mechanism,msa_2009563919
that looks for clusters in subspaces of multidimensional data,Purpose,msa_2009563919
Existing methods are typically superlinear in space or execution time,Background,msa_2009563919
"Halite 's strengths are that it is fast and scalable , while still giving highly accurate results",Mechanism,msa_2009563919
"Specifically the main contributions of Halite are : 1 ) Scalability : it is linear or quasi linear in time and space regarding the data size and dimensionality , and the dimensionality of the clusters ' subspaces ; 2 ) Usability : it is deterministic , robust to noise , does n't take the number of clusters as an input parameter , and detects clusters in subspaces generated by original axes or by their linear combinations , including space rotation ; 3 )",Mechanism,msa_2009563919
"Effectiveness : it is accurate , providing results with equal or better quality compared to top related works",Findings,msa_2009563919
; and 4 ) Generality : it includes a soft clustering approach,Mechanism,msa_2009563919
Experiments on synthetic data ranging from five to 30 axes and up to 1 \rm million points were performed,Method,msa_2009563919
"Halite was in average at least 12 times faster than seven representative works , and always presented highly accurate results",Findings,msa_2009563919
On real data,Method,msa_2009563919
", Halite was at least 11 times faster than others , increasing their accuracy in up to 35 percent",Findings,msa_2009563919
"Analysts synthesize complex , qualitative data to uncover themes and concepts , but the process is time-consuming , cognitively taxing , and automated techniques show mixed success",Background,msa_2009681737
"Crowdsourcing could help this process through on-demand harnessing of flexible and powerful human cognition , but incurs other challenges including limited attention and expertise",Background,msa_2009681737
"Further , text data can be complex , high-dimensional , and ill-structured",Background,msa_2009681737
"We address two major challenges unsolved in prior crowd clustering work : scaffolding expertise for novice crowd workers , and creating consistent and accurate categories when each worker only sees a small portion of the data",Purpose,msa_2009681737
To address these challenges we present an empirical study of a two-stage approach to enable crowds to create an accurate and useful overview of a dataset : A ) we draw on cognitive theory to assess how re-representing data can shorten and focus the data on salient dimensions ; and,Method,msa_2009681737
B ) introduce an iterative clustering approach that provides workers a global overview of data,Mechanism,msa_2009681737
"Sequencing of RNAs ( RNA-Seq ) has revolutionized the field of transcriptomics , but the reads obtained often contain errors",Background,msa_2009735916
Read error correction can have a large impact on our ability to accurately assemble transcripts,Background,msa_2009735916
"This is especially true for de novo transcriptome analysis , where a reference genome is not available",Background,msa_2009735916
"Current read error correction methods , developed for DNA sequence data , can not handle the overlapping effects of non-uniform abundance , polymorphisms and alternative splicing",Purpose,msa_2009735916
"Here we present SEquencing Error CorrEction in Rna-seq data ( SEECER ) , a hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) based method , which is",Mechanism,msa_2009735916
the first to successfully address these problems,Purpose,msa_2009735916
SEECER efficiently learns hundreds of thousands of HMMs and uses these to correct sequencing errors,Mechanism,msa_2009735916
"Using human RNA-Seq data ,",Method,msa_2009735916
we show that SEECER greatly improves on previous methods in terms of quality of read alignment to the genome and assembly accuracy,Findings,msa_2009735916
"To illustrate the usefulness of SEECER for de novo transcriptome studies , we generated new RNA-Seq data to study the development of the sea cucumber Parastichopus parvimensis",Method,msa_2009735916
Our corrected assembled transcripts shed new light on two important stages in sea cucumber development,Findings,msa_2009735916
Comparison of the assembled transcripts to known transcripts in other species,Method,msa_2009735916
"has also revealed novel transcripts that are unique to sea cucumber , some of which we have",Findings,msa_2009735916

"The HMT3522 progression series of human breast cells have been used to discover how tissue architecture , microenvironment and signaling molecules affect breast cell growth and behaviors",Background,msa_2010334024
"However , much remains to be elucidated about malignant and phenotypic reversion behaviors of the HMT3522-T4-2 cells of this series",Purpose,msa_2010334024
"We employed a pan-cell-state strategy ,",Mechanism,msa_2010334024
and analyzed jointly microarray profiles obtained from different state-specific cell populations from this progression and reversion model of the breast cells,Method,msa_2010334024
"using a tree-lineage multi-network inference algorithm , Treegl",Mechanism,msa_2010334024
We found that different breast cell states contain distinct gene networks,Findings,msa_2010334024
"The network specific to non-malignant HMT3522-S1 cells is dominated by genes involved in normal processes , whereas the T4-2-specific network is enriched with cancer-related genes",Findings,msa_2010334024
"The networks specific to various conditions of the reverted T4-2 cells are enriched with pathways suggestive of compensatory effects , consistent with clinical data showing patient resistance to anticancer drugs",Findings,msa_2010334024
"We validated the findings using an external dataset ,",Method,msa_2010334024
and showed that aberrant expression values of certain hubs in the identified networks are associated with poor clinical outcomes,Findings,msa_2010334024
"For urban driving , knowledge of ego-vehicle 's position is a critical piece of information that enables ad- vanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute safety-related , autonomous driving maneuvers",Background,msa_2010688158
"This is because , without knowing the current location , it is very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future",Background,msa_2010688158
"The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination of Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) , an inertial mea- surement unit , and a digital map",Background,msa_2010688158
"However , on urban driving environments , due to poor satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception , their longitudinal and lateral errors are too significant to be used to guide an autonomous system",Background,msa_2010688158
"To enhance the existing system 's localization capability ,",Purpose,msa_2010688158
this work presents an effort of developing a vision-based lateral localization algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2010688158
"The algorithm aims at reliably counting , with or without observations of lane-markings , the number road-lanes and identifying the index of the road-lane on the roadway that our vehicle happens to be driving on",Mechanism,msa_2010688158
Testings the proposed algorithms against inter-city and inter-state highway videos,Method,msa_2010688158
We present a generic event detection system evaluated in the Surveillance Event Detection ( SED ) task of TRECVID 2012,Purpose,msa_2010783580
"We investigate a statistical approach with spatio-temporal features applied to seven event classes , which were defined by the SED task",Mechanism,msa_2010783580
"This approach is based on local spatio-temporal descriptors , called MoSIFT and generated by pair-wise video frames",Mechanism,msa_2010783580
A Gaussian Mixture Model ( GMM ) is learned to model the distribution of the low level features,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
"Then for each sliding window , the Fisher vector encoding [ improvedFV ] is used to generate the sample representation",Mechanism,msa_2010783580
The model is learnt using a Linear SVM for each event,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
The main novelty of our system is the introduction of Fisher vector encoding into video event detection,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
Fisher vector encoding has demonstrated great success in image classification,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
The key idea is to model the low level visual features as a Gaussian Mixture Model and to generate an intermediate vector representation for bag of features,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
FV encoding uses higher order statistics in place of histograms in the standard BoW,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
FV has several good properties : ( a ) it can naturally separate the video specific information from the noisy local features and ( b ) we can use a linear model for this representation,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
We build an efficient implementation for FV encoding which can attain a 10 times speed-up over real-time,Mechanism,msa_2010783580

multi-scale detection and non-maximum suppression,Mechanism,msa_2010783580
Background : Drug discovery and development has been aided by high throughput screening methods that detect compound effects on a single target,Background,msa_2010865240
"However , when using focused initial screening , undesirable secondary effects are often detected late in the development process after significant investment has been made",Background,msa_2010865240
"An alternative approach would be to screen against undesired effects early in the process , but the number of possible secondary targets makes this prohibitively expensive",Purpose,msa_2010865240
Results :,Findings,msa_2010865240
This paper describes methods,Mechanism,msa_2010865240
for making this global approach practical,Purpose,msa_2010865240
by constructing predictive models for many target responses to many compounds and using them to guide experimentation,Mechanism,msa_2010865240
"We demonstrate for the first time that by jointly modeling targets and compounds using descriptive features and using active machine learning methods , accurate models can be built by doing only a small fraction of possible experiments",Mechanism,msa_2010865240
"The methods were evaluated by computational experiments using a dataset of 177 assays and 20,000 compounds constructed from the PubChem database",Method,msa_2010865240
Conclusions : An average of nearly 60 % of all hits in the dataset were found after exploring only 3 % of the experimental space which suggests that active learning can be used to enable more complete characterization of compound effects than otherwise affordable,Findings,msa_2010865240
"With the increasing availability of metropolitan transportation data , such as those from vehicle Global Positioning Systems ( GPSs ) and road-side sensors ,",Background,msa_2010900220
"it has become viable for authorities , operators , and individuals to analyze the data for better understanding of the transportation system and , possibly , improved utilization and planning of the system",Purpose,msa_2010900220
"We report our experience in building the Visual Analytics for Intelligent Transportation ( VAIT ) system , which is the first system on real-life large-scale data sets",Mechanism,msa_2010900220
for intelligent transportation,Purpose,msa_2010900220
Our key observation is that metropolitan transportation data are inherently visual as they are spatio-temporal around road networks,Mechanism,msa_2010900220
"Therefore , we visualize and manage traffic data , together with digital maps , and support analytical queries through this interactive visual interface",Mechanism,msa_2010900220

"An interesting and yet little-explored possibility is the computer as highly autonomous performer of popular music , capable of joining a mixed ensemble of computers and humans",Background,msa_2011061352

Fast Fourier transform algorithms on large data sets achieve poor performance on various platforms because of the inefficient strided memory access patterns,Background,msa_2011695642

Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck,Background,msa_2011863672
Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent ( but sometimes honest ) users,Background,msa_2011863672
"However , small-scale , stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank Eigen analysis used in practice",Purpose,msa_2011863672

"As the complexity of software for Cyber-Physical Systems ( CPS ) rapidly increases , multi-core processors and parallel programming models such as OpenMP become appealing to CPS developers for guaranteeing timeliness",Background,msa_2012173880
"Hence , a parallel task on multi-core processors is expected to become a vital component in CPS such as a self-driving car , where tasks must be scheduled in real-time",Background,msa_2012173880

"A well-studied approach to the design of voting rules views them as maximum likelihood estimators ; given votes that are seen as noisy estimates of a true ranking of the alternatives , the rule must reconstruct the most likely true ranking",Background,msa_2012215691
"We argue that this is too stringent a requirement , and instead ask : How many votes does a voting rule need to reconstruct the true ranking ?",Purpose,msa_2012215691
"We define the family of pairwise-majority consistent rules ,",Mechanism,msa_2012215691
"and show that for all rules in this family the number of samples required from the Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of alternatives , and that no rule can do asymptotically better ( while some rules like plurality do much worse )",Findings,msa_2012215691
"Taking a more normative point of view , we consider voting rules that surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends to infinity ( we call this property accuracy in the limit ) ; this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction",Mechanism,msa_2012215691
"We study families of noise models that are parametrized by distance functions ,",Method,msa_2012215691

How do we find patterns and anomalies in very large graphs with billions of nodes and edges ? How to mine such big graphs efficiently ?,Purpose,msa_2013246060
"Big graphs are everywhere , ranging from social networks and mobile call networks to biological networks and the World Wide Web",Background,msa_2013246060
"Mining big graphs leads to many interesting applications including cyber security , fraud detection , Web search , recommendation , and many more",Background,msa_2013246060

We address the challenging problem of utilizing related exemplars for complex event detection while multiple features are available,Purpose,msa_2013309773
"Related exemplars share certain positive elements of the event , but have no uniform pattern due to the huge variance of relevance levels among different related exemplars",Purpose,msa_2013309773
None of the existing multiple feature fusion methods can deal with the related exemplars,Purpose,msa_2013309773
"In this paper , we propose an algorithm which adaptively utilizes the related exemplars by cross-feature learning",Mechanism,msa_2013309773
Ordinal labels are used to represent the multiple relevance levels of the related videos,Mechanism,msa_2013309773
Label candidates of related exemplars are generated by exploring the possible relevance levels of each related exemplar via a cross-feature voting strategy,Mechanism,msa_2013309773
"Maximum margin criterion is then applied in our framework to discriminate the positive and negative exemplars , as well as the related exemplars from different relevance levels",Mechanism,msa_2013309773
We test our algorithm using the large scale TRECVID 2011 dataset,Method,msa_2013309773

Brain ? computer interfaces ( BCIs ) are being developed to assist paralyzed people and amputees by translating neural activity into movements of a computer cursor or prosthetic limb,Background,msa_2014148560
"Here we introduce a novel BCI task paradigm ,",Mechanism,msa_2014148560
intended to help accelerate improvements to BCI systems,Purpose,msa_2014148560
"Through this task , we can push the performance limits of BCI systems , we can quantify more accurately how well a BCI system captures the user ? s intent , and we can increase the richness of the BCI movement repertoire",Mechanism,msa_2014148560
Approach,Mechanism,msa_2014148560
"We have implemented an instructed path task , wherein the user must drive a cursor along a visible path",Mechanism,msa_2014148560
The instructed path task provides a versatile framework to increase the difficulty of the task and thereby push the limits of performance,Mechanism,msa_2014148560
"Relative to traditional point-to-point tasks , the instructed path task allows more thorough analysis of decoding performance and greater richness of movement kinematics",Mechanism,msa_2014148560

We demonstrate that monkeys are able to perform the instructed path task in a closed-loop BCI setting,Findings,msa_2014148560

ABSTRACT One of the main challenges in real-world application of guided-waves based nondestructive evaluation ( NDE ) of pipelines is their sensitivity to changes in environmental and operational conditions ( EOC ) that these structures are subject to,Background,msa_2016037327
"In spite of many favorable characteristics of gu ided-waves for NDE of pipes , their multi-modal , dispersive , and multi-path characteristics result in complex signa ls whose interpretation is a difficult task",Background,msa_2016037327
Studies that have considered the effects of EOC varia tions either fail to reflect realistic EOC scenarios ( e,Purpose,msa_2016037327
", limited to particular effects of specific EOCs , like time shifting effects of temperature in plates ) or lack the necessary understanding of the effects of EOC variations on different aspects of the developed damage detection approaches",Purpose,msa_2016037327
Such gaps limit the extensibility of these approaches to pipeline applications outside of controlled environments,Purpose,msa_2016037327
"This paper motivates the idea of analytically incorporating the effects of temperature and flow rate variations into damage diagnosis of pipes , through a number of case studie s",Purpose,msa_2016037327
A review of the existing literature on guided-wave based testing is also provided,Purpose,msa_2016037327
"For damage detection , a linear supervised classification method , namely linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) ,",Mechanism,msa_2016037327
is applied to experimental guided-wave data recorded from a hot water piping system under regular operation,Method,msa_2016037327

"The system consists of a three-tiered architecture with a cloud-based monitoring and control service , a local embedded gateway infrastructure and a mesh network of wireless smart meters deployed at 52 buildings",Mechanism,msa_2017235528

4 radio that enables remote monitoring and control of electrical service,Mechanism,msa_2017235528
The meters communicate over a scalable multi-hop TDMA network back to a central gateway that manages load within the system,Mechanism,msa_2017235528
The gateway also provides an 802,Mechanism,msa_2017235528
11 interface for an on-site operator and a cellular modem connection to a cloud-backend that manages and stores billing and usage data,Mechanism,msa_2017235528

The system activates each meter within seconds and locally enforces power limits with provisioning for theft detection,Mechanism,msa_2017235528
We believe that this fine-grained micro-payment model can enable sustainable power in otherwise unfeasible areas,Purpose,msa_2017235528

"Steps in the pipeline included extraction of robust progression markers from the data , which could differentiate stages of tumor evolution or the different paths in the tree , and assigning amplification states to the inferred markers in those stages",Background,msa_2017531104
"We introduced a novel multi-sample model for amplicon identification and calling , HMMCNA , which jointly extracted markers from and assigned amplification states to small sets of tumor aCGH profiles",Background,msa_2017531104
"HMMCNA employs a Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) , a probabilistic model , to classify data into normal and amplified states based on an underlying distribution for the two copy number states and a hidden state space of possible amplification states",Background,msa_2017531104
We assumed two possible amplification states per sample : normal ( 0 ) or amplified ( 1 ),Background,msa_2017531104
Joint segmentation and calling is performed by identifying a most likely sequence of amplification states across all genomic sites probes and samples,Background,msa_2017531104
This approach limits in the number of samples the HMM can handle since the number of possible hidden amplification states increases exponentially with the number of samples,Purpose,msa_2017531104
"Here , we present an extension of the approach to handle large datasets",Purpose,msa_2017531104
We incorporate a heuristic prior to the HMM classification,Mechanism,msa_2017531104
to reduce the hidden state space,Purpose,msa_2017531104
by first screening out amplification states not strongly supported at any individual genome coordinates,Mechanism,msa_2017531104
The introduction of this heuristic reduces the state space on average by 99 %,Findings,msa_2017531104
We further reduce the set of possible amplification states based on the frequency of occurrence of the states by only allowing those states occuring at multiple aCGH probes or array genome coordinate,Mechanism,msa_2017531104
This step accounts for the presence of random noise in the data and,Mechanism,msa_2017531104
gives a further reduction of 80 %,Findings,msa_2017531104
"We demonstrate the method on a breast tumor aCGH dataset comprising copy number profiles derived from sectioned biopsy samples ( NCBI GEO [ GSE16672 ] [ 1 ] , Navin et al",Mechanism,msa_2017531104
", 2010 )",Mechanism,msa_2017531104
Our method was able to quickly segment the data into sets of robust normal and amplified segments suitable for downstream phylogeny building,Findings,msa_2017531104

"Promising techniques to ensure safety seem to be model-driven engineering to develop hybrid systems in a well-defined and traceable manner , and formal verification to prove their correctness",Background,msa_2018140586
Their combination forms the vision of verification-driven engineering,Background,msa_2018140586
"Often , hybrid systems are rather complex in that they require expertise from many domains ( e",Background,msa_2018140586

"Moreover , despite the remarkable progress in automating formal verification of hybrid systems , the construction of proofs of complex systems often requires nontrivial human guidance , since hybrid systems verification tools solve undecidable problems",Purpose,msa_2018140586
"It is , thus , not uncommon for development and verification teams to consist of many players with diverse expertise",Purpose,msa_2018140586
This paper introduces a verification-driven engineering toolset that extends our previous work on hybrid and arithmetic verification with,Mechanism,msa_2018140586

"Data imbalance problem often exists in our real life dataset , especial for massive video dataset ,",Background,msa_2018671199

"In this paper , the data imbalance problem in semantic extraction under massive video dataset is exploited , and enhanced and hierarchical structure ( called EHS ) algorithm is proposed",Mechanism,msa_2018671199

"Rating data is ubiquitous on websites such as Amazon , TripAdvisor , or Yelp",Background,msa_2020214545
"Since ratings are not static but given at various points in time , a temporal analysis of rating data provides deeper insights into the evolution of a product 's quality",Background,msa_2020214545
"In this work , we tackle the following question : Given the time stamped rating data for a product or service , how can we detect the general rating behavior of users as well as time intervals where the ratings behave anomalous ?",Purpose,msa_2020214545
We propose a Bayesian model that represents the rating data as sequence of categorical mixture models,Mechanism,msa_2020214545
"In contrast to existing methods , our method does not require any aggregation of the input but it operates on the original time stamped data",Mechanism,msa_2020214545
"To capture the dynamic effects of the ratings , the categorical mixtures are temporally constrained : Anomalies can occur in specific time intervals only and the general rating behavior should evolve smoothly over time",Mechanism,msa_2020214545
"Our method automatically determines the intervals where anomalies occur , and it captures the temporal effects of the general behavior by using a state space model on the natural parameters of the categorical distributions",Mechanism,msa_2020214545

"PLAID currently contains measurements for more than 200 different appliance instances , representing 11 appliance classes , and totaling more than a thousand records",Mechanism,msa_2020517213

Abstraction has emerged as a key component in solving extensive-form games of incomplete information,Background,msa_2020820252
"However , lossless abstractions are typically too large to solve , so lossy abstraction is needed",Background,msa_2020820252
"All prior lossy abstraction algorithms for extensive-form games either 1 ) had no bounds on solution quality or 2 ) depended on specific equilibrium computation approaches , limited forms of abstraction , and only decreased the number of information sets rather than nodes in the game tree",Purpose,msa_2020820252
We introduce a theoretical framework that can be used,Mechanism,msa_2020820252
to give bounds on solution quality for any perfect-recall extensive-form game,Purpose,msa_2020820252
"The framework uses a new notion for mapping abstract strategies to the original game , and it leverages a new equilibrium refinement for analysis",Mechanism,msa_2020820252
"Using this framework , we develop the first general lossy extensive-form game abstraction method with bounds",Mechanism,msa_2020820252
Experiments,Method,msa_2020820252
show that it finds a lossless abstraction when one is available and lossy abstractions when smaller abstractions are desired,Findings,msa_2020820252
"Abstract Image patterns at different spatial levels are well organized , such as regions within one image and feature points within one region",Background,msa_2020825528
These classes of spatial structures are hierarchical in nature,Background,msa_2020825528
The appropriate integration and utilization of such relationship are important to improve the performance of region tagging,Purpose,msa_2020825528
"Inspired by the recent advances of sparse coding methods ,",Purpose,msa_2020825528
"we propose an approach , called Unified Dictionary Learning and Region Tagging with Hierarchical Sparse Representation",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
This approach consists of two steps : region representation and region reconstruction,Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"In the first step , rather than using the l 1 -norm as it is commonly done in sparse coding , we add a hierarchical structure to the process of sparse coding and form a framework of tree-guided dictionary learning",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"In this framework , the hierarchical structures among feature points , regions , and images are encoded by forming a tree-guided multi-task learning process",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"With the learned dictionary , we obtain a better representation of training and testing regions",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"In the second step , we propose to use a sub-hierarchical structure to guide the sparse reconstruction for testing regions , i",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
", the structure between regions and images",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"Thanks to this hierarchy , the obtained reconstruction coefficients are more discriminate",Mechanism,msa_2020825528
"Finally , tags are propagated to testing regions by the learned reconstruction coefficients",Mechanism,msa_2020825528

"ABSTRACT Guided wave ultrasonics is an attractive technique for structural health monitoring , especially on pressurized pipes",Background,msa_2021207773
"However , civil infrastructure components , including pipes , are often subject to large environmental and operational variations that prevent traditional baseline subtraction-based approaches from detecting damage",Purpose,msa_2021207773
We collect ultrasonic data on a large-scale pipe segment in its normal operating conditions and observe large environmental variations,Purpose,msa_2021207773

"The execution of an agent 's complex activities , comprising sequences of simpler actions , sometimes leads to the clash of conflicting functions that must be optimized",Background,msa_2021472139

The way that these functions are weighted is usually unknown even to the decision maker,Background,msa_2021472139
"But if we were able to understand the individual motivations and compare such motivations among individuals , then we would be able to actively change the environment so as to increase satisfaction and/or improve performance",Background,msa_2021472139

"Thus , despite decades of innovation in light source technology , more than half of the vehicular accidents still happen at night even with much less traffic on the road",Purpose,msa_2022575916
We will describe a new DMD-based design for a headlight that can be programmed to perform several tasks simultaneously and,Mechanism,msa_2022575916
"that can sense , react and adapt quickly to any environment with the goal of increasing safety for all drivers on the road",Purpose,msa_2022575916
"For example , we will be able to drive with high-beams without glaring any other driver and we will be able to see better during rain and snowstorms when the road is most treacherous to drive",Mechanism,msa_2022575916
"The headlight can also increase contrast of lanes , markings and sidewalks and can alert drivers to sudden obstacles",Mechanism,msa_2022575916
"In this talk , we will lay out the engineering challenges in building this headlight and share our experiences",Findings,msa_2022575916
"Estimating the number of people within a room is important for a wide variety of applications including : HVAC load management , scheduling room allocations and guiding first responders to areas with trapped people",Background,msa_2023066921
"In this paper , we present an active sensing technique that uses changes in a room 's acoustic properties",Mechanism,msa_2023066921
to estimate the number of occupants,Purpose,msa_2023066921
Frequency dependent models of reverberation and room capacity are often used when designing auditoriums and concert halls,Mechanism,msa_2023066921
We leverage this property by using measured changes in the ultrasonic spectrum reflected back from a wide-band transmitter to estimate occupancy,Mechanism,msa_2023066921
A centrally located beacon transmits an ultrasonic chirp and then records how the signal dissipates over time,Mechanism,msa_2023066921
"By analyzing the frequency response over the chirp 's bandwidth at a few known occupancy levels , we are able to extrapolate the response as the number of people in the room changes",Mechanism,msa_2023066921
We explore the design of an excitation signal that best senses the environment with the fewest number of training samples,Mechanism,msa_2023066921
"Through experimentation ,",Method,msa_2023066921
we show that our approach is able to capture the number of people in a wide-variety of room configurations with people counting accuracy below 10 % of the maximum room capacity count with as few as two training points,Findings,msa_2023066921
"Finally , we provide a simple mechanism that allows our system",Mechanism,msa_2023066921
Organizations collect personal information from individuals to carry out their business functions,Background,msa_2023083005
"Federal privacy regulations , such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) , mandate how this collected information can be shared by the organizations",Background,msa_2023083005
It is thus incumbent upon the organizations to have means to check compliance with the applicable regulations,Background,msa_2023083005
Prior work by Barth et,Background,msa_2023083005
al,Background,msa_2023083005
"introduces two notions of compliance , weak compliance ( WC ) and strong compliance ( SC )",Background,msa_2023083005
WC ensures that present requirements of the policy can be met whereas SC also ensures obligations can be met,Background,msa_2023083005
An action is compliant with a privacy policy if it is both weakly and strongly compliant,Background,msa_2023083005
"However , their definitions of compliance are restricted to only propositional linear temporal logic ( pLTL ) , which can not feasibly specify HIPAA",Purpose,msa_2023083005
"To this end , we present a policy specification language based on a restricted subset of first order temporal logic ( FOTL )",Mechanism,msa_2023083005
which can capture the privacy requirements of HIPAA,Purpose,msa_2023083005
We then formally specify WC and SC for policies of our form,Mechanism,msa_2023083005
We prove that checking WC is feasible whereas checking SC is undecidable,Findings,msa_2023083005
"We then formally specify the property WC entails SC , denoted by , which requires that each weakly compliant action is also strongly compliant",Mechanism,msa_2023083005
"To check whether an action is compliant with such a policy , it is sufficient to only check whether the action is weakly compliant with that policy",Mechanism,msa_2023083005
"We also prove that when a policy has the -property , the present requirements of the policy reduce to the safety requirements imposed by",Mechanism,msa_2023083005
"We then develop a sound , semi-automated technique for checking whether practical policies have the -property",Mechanism,msa_2023083005
The increase in the number of bloggers and the amount of information diffused in the blogosphere makes the blogosphere an important medium through which to communicate and exchange information,Background,msa_2023586012
"Accordingly , the interest in understanding the nature of the information diffusion in the blogosphere has also been increased",Background,msa_2023586012
Existing studies in social networks have mainly focused on the information diffusion through explicit relationships between members,Purpose,msa_2023586012
"In this paper , we analyze the causes for the information diffusion without explicit relationships in the blogosphere",Purpose,msa_2023586012
"BlogCast , a functionality provided by blog-service providers to expose a high quality post on the portal main page , is found to be one of the main causes of the information diffusion without explicit relationships",Findings,msa_2023586012

We introduce RegionSpeak,Mechanism,msa_2023615143
"to allow blind users to capture large areas of visual information , identify all of the objects within them , and explore their spatial layout",Purpose,msa_2023615143
The proliferation of Bluetooth Low-Energy ( BLE ) chipsets on mobile devices has lead to a wide variety of user-installable tags and beacons designed for location-aware applications,Background,msa_2023923947
"In this paper , we present the Acoustic Location Processing System ( ALPS ) , a platform that augments BLE transmitters with ultrasound in a manner",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
that improves ranging accuracy and can help users configure indoor localization systems with minimal effort,Purpose,msa_2023923947
A user places three or more beacons in an environment and then walks through a calibration sequence with their mobile device where they touch key points in the environment like the floor and the corners of the room,Mechanism,msa_2023923947
This process automatically computes the room geometry as well as the precise beacon locations without needing auxiliary measurements,Mechanism,msa_2023923947
"Once configured , the system can track a user 's location referenced to a map",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
"The platform consists of time-synchronized ultrasonic transmitters that utilize the bandwidth just above the human hearing limit , where mobile devices are still sensitive and can detect ranging signals",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
"To aid in the mapping process , the beacons perform inter-beacon ranging during setup",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
Each beacon includes a BLE radio that can identify and trigger the ultrasonic signals,Mechanism,msa_2023923947
"By using differences in propagation characteristics between ultrasound and radio , the system can classify if beacons are within Line-Of-Sight ( LOS ) to the mobile phone",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
"In cases where beacons are blocked , we show how the phone 's inertial measurement sensors can be used to supplement localization data",Mechanism,msa_2023923947
We experimentally evaluate,Method,msa_2023923947
that our system can estimate three-dimensional beacon location with a Euclidean distance error of 16,Findings,msa_2023923947

"When tested in six different environments ,",Method,msa_2023923947
We explore methods,Mechanism,msa_2024675961
for improving the readability of real- time captions,Purpose,msa_2024675961
by allowing users to more easily switch their gaze between multiple visual information sources,Mechanism,msa_2024675961
"Real-time captioning provides deaf and hard of hearing ( DHH ) users with access to spoken content during live events , and the web has allowed these services to be provided via remotely- located captioning services , and for web content itself",Background,msa_2024675961
"However , despite caption benefits , spoken language reading rates often result in DHH users falling behind spoken content , especially when the audio is paired with visual references",Purpose,msa_2024675961
"This is particularly true in classroom settings , where multi-modal content is the norm , and captions are often poorly positioned in the room , relative to speakers",Purpose,msa_2024675961
"Additionally , this accommodation can benefit other students who face temporary or `` situational '' disabilities such as listening to unfamiliar speech accents , or if a student is in a location with poor acoustics",Purpose,msa_2024675961
"In this paper , we explore pausing and highlighting as a means of helping DHH students keep up with live classroom content by helping them track their place when reading text involving visual references",Mechanism,msa_2024675961
Our experiments,Method,msa_2024675961
"show that by providing users with a tool to more easily track their place in a transcript while viewing live video , it is possible for them to follow visual content that might otherwise have been missed",Findings,msa_2024675961
"Both pausing and highlighting have a positive impact on students ' scores on comprehension tests , but highlighting is preferred to pausing , and yields nearly twice as large of an improvement",Findings,msa_2024675961
"We then discuss several issues with captioning that we observed during our design process and user study ,",Findings,msa_2024675961
This paper introduces a 3D-stacked logic-in-memory ( LiM ) system,Mechanism,msa_2024818089
to accelerate the processing of sparse matrix data that is held in a 3D DRAM system,Purpose,msa_2024818089

"Automatic face recognition performance has been steadily improving over years of research ,",Background,msa_2025217965
"however it remains significantly affected by a number of factors such as illumination , pose , expression , resolution and other factors that can impact matching scores",Purpose,msa_2025217965
The focus of this paper is the pose problem which remains largely overlooked in most real-world applications,Purpose,msa_2025217965
"Specifically , we focus on one-to-one matching scenarios where a query face image of a random pose is matched against a set of gallery images",Purpose,msa_2025217965
We propose a method that relies on two fundamental components : ( a ) A 3D modeling step,Mechanism,msa_2025217965
to geometrically correct the viewpoint of the face,Purpose,msa_2025217965
"For this purpose , we extend a recent technique for efficient synthesis of 3D face models called 3D Generic Elastic Model",Mechanism,msa_2025217965
( b ) A sparse feature extraction step using subspace modeling and l1-minimization to induce pose-tolerance in coefficient space,Mechanism,msa_2025217965
"This in return enables the synthesis of an equivalent frontal-looking face , which can be used towards recognition",Mechanism,msa_2025217965
We show significant performance improvements in verification rates,Findings,msa_2025217965
"compared to commercial matchers ,",Method,msa_2025217965
Autonomous agents that operate as components of dynamic spatial systems are becoming increasingly popular and mainstream,Background,msa_2025587368
"Applications can be found in consumer robotics , in road , rail , and air transportation , manufacturing , and military operations",Background,msa_2025587368
"Unfortunately , the approaches to modeling and analyzing the behavior of dynamic spatial systems are just as diverse as these application domains",Purpose,msa_2025587368
"In this article , we discuss reasoning approaches",Mechanism,msa_2025587368
for the medium-term control of autonomous agents in dynamic spatial systems,Purpose,msa_2025587368
", which requires a sufficiently detailed description of the agents behavior and environment but may still be conducted in a qualitative manner",Mechanism,msa_2025587368
"We survey logic-based qualitative and hybrid modeling and commonsense reasoning approaches with respect to their features for describing and analyzing dynamic spatial systems in general , and the actions of autonomous agents operating therein in particular",Method,msa_2025587368
"We introduce a conceptual reference model , which summarizes the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic spatial systems based on a catalog of evaluation criteria derived from the model",Mechanism,msa_2025587368
"We assess the modeling features provided by logic-based qualitative commonsense and hybrid approaches for projection , planning , simulation , and verification of dynamic spatial systems",Method,msa_2025587368
"We provide a comparative summary of the modeling features , discuss lessons learned , and introduce a research roadmap",Mechanism,msa_2025587368
We show an improved parallel algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2025919541
for decomposing an undirected unweighted graph into small diameter pieces,Purpose,msa_2025919541
with a small fraction of the edges in between,Mechanism,msa_2025919541
These decompositions form critical subroutines in a number of graph algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2025919541
"Our algorithm builds upon the shifted shortest path approach introduced in [ Blelloch , Gupta , Koutis , Miller , Peng , Tangwongsan , SPAA 2011 ]",Mechanism,msa_2025919541
"By combining various stages of the previous algorithm , we obtain a significantly simpler algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2025919541
Human computation allows computer systems to leverage human intelligence in computational processes,Background,msa_2025945592
"While it has primarily been used for tasks that are not time-sensitive , recent systems use crowdsourcing to get on-demand , real-time , and even interactive results",Purpose,msa_2025945592
"In this paper , we present techniques",Mechanism,msa_2025945592
for building real-time crowdsourcing systems,Purpose,msa_2025945592
", and then discuss how and when to use them",Mechanism,msa_2025945592
Large-scale collaboration systems often separate their content from the deliberation around how that content was produced,Background,msa_2026290661
"Surfacing this deliberation may engender trust in the content generation process if the deliberation process appears fair , well-reasoned , and thorough",Purpose,msa_2026290661
"Alternatively , it could encourage doubts about content quality , especially if the process appears messy or biased",Purpose,msa_2026290661
In this paper we report the results of an experiment,Method,msa_2026290661
We describe a three-stage model,Mechanism,msa_2026323048
of computing instruction,Purpose,msa_2026323048
"beginning with a simple , highly scaffolded programming environment ( Kodu ) and progressing to more challenging frameworks ( Alice and Lego NXT-G )",Mechanism,msa_2026323048
"In moving between frameworks , students explore the similarities and differences in how concepts such as variables , conditionals , and looping are realized",Mechanism,msa_2026323048

We describe computational methods,Mechanism,msa_2026522435
to compute likely evolutionary histories from tumor single-cell copy number data and next generation sequencing data and apply the methods to data collected from diverse types of tumors,Purpose,msa_2026522435
"Experimental techniques for assessing heterogeneity in tumor cell populations have undergone great advances ,",Background,msa_2026522435
but these improvements have created a great need for more sophisticated computer algorithms capable of making sense of these data sources in terms of coherent models of tumor evolution,Purpose,msa_2026522435
We have addressed this problem,Purpose,msa_2026522435
by developing computer algorithms for building phylogenetic trees describing evolution of individual tumors based on copy numbers of fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) probes from single cells in these tumors,Mechanism,msa_2026522435
These algorithms reconstruct evolutionary trees for observed cell populations so as to heuristically minimize the number of mutational events needed to explain the observed combinations of probe counts by evolution from a common diploid ancestral cell,Mechanism,msa_2026522435
"We have extended this work from initial simple evolutionary models of evolution by single copy number changes to account for distinct mechanisms of evolution at the gene , chromosome , or whole-genome scale , with potentially different rates of evolution by mutation type",Mechanism,msa_2026522435
"We have applied these algorithms to several FISH data sets , including cervical cancers probed for four genes ( LAMP3 , PROX1 , PRKAA1 and CCND1 ) measured for up to 250 cells of paired primary and metastatic samples from 16 patients , head-and-neck cancers probed for four genes ( TERC , CCND1 , EGFR and TP53 ) measured on up to 250 cells per patient for 65 patients at four tumor stages , prostate cancers probed for six genes ( TBL1XR1 , CTTNBP2 , MYC , PTEN , MEN1 and PDGFB ) measured for up to 407 cells in 6 non-progressive and 7 progressive carcinomas , and breast cancers probed for eight genes ( COX-2 , MYC , CCND1 , HER-2 , ZNF217 , DBC2 , CDH1 and TP53 ) measured on up to 220 cells of paired of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma samples from 13 patients",Method,msa_2026522435
We have then applied statistical and machine learning analysis to examine the ability of these trees to classify tumors by stage or potential for progression,Method,msa_2026522435
The evolutionary tree models reveal robust features of evolutionary processes distinguishing progression stages and predicting future progression that lead to improved classification accuracy relative to predictions from cellular heterogeneity data alone,Findings,msa_2026522435

Remote research participants were asked to memorize 4 Person-Action-Object ( PAO ) stories where they chose a famous personfrom a drop-down list and were given machine-generated randomaction-object pairs,Method,msa_2027670258
Users were also shown a photo of a scene andasked to imagine the PAO story taking place in the scene ( e,Method,msa_2027670258

"Subsequently , theywere asked to recall the action-object pairs when prompted withthe associated scene-person pairs following a spaced repetitionschedule over a period of 127+ days",Method,msa_2027670258
"While we evaluated severalspaced repetition schedules ,",Method,msa_2027670258
the best results were obtained whenusers initially returned after 12 hours and then in 1:5 increasingintervals : 77 % of the participants successfully recalled all 4stories in 10 tests over a period of 158 days,Findings,msa_2027670258

"These ndings , coupled with recent results on naturallyrehearsing password schemes , suggest that 4 PAO stories couldbe used to create usable and strong passwords for 14 sensitiveaccounts following this spaced repetition schedule , possibly witha few extra upfront rehearsals",Background,msa_2027670258
"In addition , we nd statisticallysignicant evidence that with 8 tests over 64 days users whowere asked to memorize 4 PAO stories outperform users whoare given 4 random action-object pairs , but with 9 tests over 128days the advantage is not signicant",Findings,msa_2027670258
"Furthermore , there is aninterference effect across multiple PAO stories : the recall rate of100 % ( resp",Findings,msa_2027670258
90 % ) for participants who were asked to memorize1 PAO story ( resp,Findings,msa_2027670258

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring ( NILM ) is a set of techniques used to estimate the electricity consumed by individual appliances in a building from measurements of the total electrical consumption,Background,msa_2028257008
"Most commonly , NILM works by first attributing any significant change in the total power consumption ( also known as an event ) to a specific load and subsequently using these attributions ( i",Background,msa_2028257008
e,Background,msa_2028257008
the labels for the events ) to estimate energy for each load,Background,msa_2028257008
"For this last step , most published work in the field makes simplifying assumptions to make the problem more tractable",Purpose,msa_2028257008
"In this paper , we present a framework",Mechanism,msa_2028257008
for creating appliance models,Purpose,msa_2028257008
based on classification labels and aggregate power measurements that can help,Mechanism,msa_2028257008
to relax many of these assumptions,Purpose,msa_2028257008
Our framework automatically builds models for appliances to perform energy estimation,Mechanism,msa_2028257008
"The model relies on feature extraction , clustering via affinity propagation , perturbation of extracted states to ensure that they mimic appliance behavior , creation of finite state models , correction of any errors in classification that might violate the model , and estimation of energy based on corrected labels",Mechanism,msa_2028257008
We evaluate our framework on 3 houses from standard datasets in the field and,Method,msa_2028257008
It is becoming more and more evident that the mechanical forces previously taken for granted actually play a pivotal role in influencing biological phenomenon from cancer metastases to vasculogenesis,Background,msa_2028418570
Recent literature provides strong evidence for a causative link between the mechanical stretching of the cytoskeleton and the release of mechanotransductive signaling molecules,Background,msa_2028418570
"Understanding the links between mechanical input , the corresponding morphological changes in the actin cytoskeleton , and the resulting biochemical response is not well understood yet is a significant challenge in the field of mechanotransduction",Purpose,msa_2028418570
"Here , we present a model that integrates actin filament network remodeling under stretch with a novel biophysical model of molecular release",Mechanism,msa_2028418570
to further elucidate the interplay between actin network morphology and resultant biochemical signaling,Purpose,msa_2028418570
As,Purpose,msa_2028418570
"stretch is applied to a model of the actin filament network , the distribution of bond angles in the network transitions from a more peaked to a flatter distribution",Mechanism,msa_2028418570
"High variability is observed from site-to-site within the network upon an applied stretch , with a nearly uniform distribution of difference between stretched and unstretched angles ( delta angles ) at high levels of stretching",Mechanism,msa_2028418570
We used our approach to explore various thresholding models of how actin filament network deformations might influence rates of release of bound signaling molecules,Mechanism,msa_2028418570
These models allow us to project how a biochemical response might appear from a given applied mechanical stimulus,Mechanism,msa_2028418570
We validate these simulations using experimental data and use our model to then test different predictive capabilities of how mechanotransduction may function,Method,msa_2028418570
Large-scale content-based semantic search in video is an interesting and fundamental problem in multimedia analysis and retrieval,Background,msa_2028502081
"Existing methods index a video by the raw concept detection score that is dense and inconsistent , and thus can not scale to `` big data '' that are readily available on the Internet",Purpose,msa_2028502081
This paper proposes a scalable solution,Mechanism,msa_2028502081
The key is a novel step called concept adjustment that represents a video by a few salient and consistent concepts that can be efficiently indexed by the modified inverted index,Mechanism,msa_2028502081
The proposed adjustment model relies on a concise optimization framework with interpretations,Mechanism,msa_2028502081
The proposed index leverages the text-based inverted index for video retrieval,Mechanism,msa_2028502081

"The paper develops $ { { \cal Q } { \cal D } } $ -learning , a distributed version of reinforcement $ Q $ -learning ,",Mechanism,msa_2028977569
for multi-agent Markov decision processes ( MDPs ) ; the agents have no prior information on the global state transition and on the local agent cost statistics,Purpose,msa_2028977569
"The network agents minimize a network-averaged infinite horizon discounted cost , by local processing and by collaborating through mutual information exchange over a sparse ( possibly stochastic ) communication network",Mechanism,msa_2028977569
The agents respond differently ( depending on their instantaneous one-stage random costs ) to a global controlled state and the control actions of a remote controller,Mechanism,msa_2028977569
"When each agent is aware only of its local online cost data and the inter-agent communication network is weakly connected ,",Method,msa_2028977569
"In a Stackelberg Security Game , a defender commits to a randomized deployment of security resources , and an attacker best-responds by attacking a target that maximizes his utility",Background,msa_2029010138
"While algorithms for computing an optimal strategy for the defender to commit to have had a striking real-world impact , deployed applications require significant information about potential attackers , leading to inefficiencies",Purpose,msa_2029010138
We address this problem,Purpose,msa_2029010138
Detection of neuronal cell differentiation is essential to study cell fate decisions under various stimuli and/or environmental conditions,Background,msa_2029030079
Many tools exist that quantify differentiation by neurite length measurements of single cells,Background,msa_2029030079
"However , quantification of differentiation in whole cell populations remains elusive so far",Background,msa_2029030079
"Because such populations can consist of both proliferating and differentiating cells , the task to assess the overall differentiation status is not trivial and requires a high-throughput , fully automated approach to analyze sufficient data for a statistically significant discrimination to determine cell differentiation",Purpose,msa_2029030079
We address the problem of detecting differentiation in a mixed population of proliferating and differentiating cells over time,Purpose,msa_2029030079
by supervised classification,Mechanism,msa_2029030079
"Using nerve growth factor induced differentiation of PC12 cells , we monitor the changes in cell morphology over days by phase-contrast live-cell imaging",Mechanism,msa_2029030079
"For general applicability , the classification procedure starts out with many features to identify those that maximize discrimination of differentiated and undifferentiated cells and to eliminate features sensitive to systematic measurement artifacts",Mechanism,msa_2029030079
"The resulting image analysis determines the optimal post treatment day for training and achieves a near perfect classification of differentiation ,",Mechanism,msa_2029030079
which we confirmed,Findings,msa_2029030079
in technically and biologically independent as well as differently designed experiments,Method,msa_2029030079
Our approach allows to monitor neuronal cell populations repeatedly over days without any interference,Mechanism,msa_2029030079
It requires only an initial calibration and training step and is thereafter capable to discriminate further experiments,Mechanism,msa_2029030079
"Mechanotransduction has been divided into mechanotransmission , mechanosensing , and mechanoresponse ,",Background,msa_2030012418
although how a cell performs all three functions using the same set of structural components is still highly debated,Purpose,msa_2030012418
"Here , we bridge the gap between emerging molecular and systems-level understandings of mechanotransduction",Purpose,msa_2030012418
through a multiscale model linking these three phases,Mechanism,msa_2030012418
Our model incorporates a discrete network of actin filaments and associated proteins that responds to stretching through geometric relaxation,Mechanism,msa_2030012418
We assess three potential activating mechanisms at mechanosensitive crosslinks as inputs to a mixture model of molecular release and benchmark each using experimental data of mechanically-induced Rho GTPase FilGAP release from actin-filamin crosslinks,Method,msa_2030012418
Our results suggest that filamin-FilGAP mechanotransduction response is best explained by a bandpass mechanism favoring release when crosslinking angles fall outside of a specific range,Findings,msa_2030012418
Our model further investigates the difference between ordered versus disordered networks,Mechanism,msa_2030012418
Understanding the unique biochemical and physical differences between typical in vitro experimental systems and the in vivo environment of a living cell is a question of great importance in building and interpreting reliable models of complex reaction systems,Background,msa_2030245620
"Virus capsids make an excellent model system for such questions because they tend to have few components , making them amenable to in vitro and modeling studies , yet their assembly can be described by enormously complex networks of possible reactions that can not be resolved by any current experimental technology",Background,msa_2030245620
"We have previously attempted to bridge the gap between the complexity of the system and the limitations of data for tracking detailed assembly pathways using simulation-based model inference , learning kinetic parameters of coarse-grained rule models by fitting simulations to light scattering data from in vitro capsid assembly systems",Background,msa_2030245620
"Here , we describe extensions of that work to attempt to understand the influence of specific features of the cellular environment , individually or in concert , on assembly pathway selection",Purpose,msa_2030245620
"We specifically focus on the effects of macromolecular crowding and nucleic acid on capsid assembly ,",Purpose,msa_2030245620
using coarse-grained biophysical models,Mechanism,msa_2030245620

Abstract Residential electricity users need more detail than monthly bills to reduce consumption,Background,msa_2030541971
"With the emergence of technologies that provide detailed usage estimates for energy consumption , two questions arise",Purpose,msa_2030541971
"First , how many different energy-consuming appliances contribute to household electricity load , and secondly which appliances ?",Purpose,msa_2030541971
"Using national average penetration rates , the Residential Energy Consumption Survey ( RECS ) , estimates that 42 unique appliances account for 93 % of electricity consumption , while 12 appliances account for 80 % of average household electric load",Background,msa_2030541971
A typical scenario is developed from national and regional penetration rates and,Method,msa_2030541971
find that eight appliances are responsible for 80 % of a household 's electric load in the United States,Findings,msa_2030541971
"Four household scenarios are developed : a house that uses electric appliances , gas appliances , the average household , and typical household",Method,msa_2030541971
It is concluded that RECS can not be used as a representative household as it overestimates the number of appliances that contribute to a household electric load,Findings,msa_2030541971
"The number of significant appliances is affected by appliance ownership and use , which is more variable between homes than between census divisions",Findings,msa_2030541971
"A genome-wide association study involves examining a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) to identify SNPs that are significantly associated with the given phenotype , while trying to reduce the false positive rate",Background,msa_2030904677
"Although haplotype-based association methods have been proposed to accommodate correlation information across nearby SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium , none of these methods directly incorporated the structural information such as recombination events along chromosome",Purpose,msa_2030904677
"In this paper , we propose a new approach called stochastic block lasso",Mechanism,msa_2030904677
for association mapping,Purpose,msa_2030904677
that exploits prior knowledge on linkage disequilibrium structure in the genome such as recombination rates and distances between adjacent SNPs in order to increase the power of detecting true associations while reducing false positives,Mechanism,msa_2030904677
"Following a typical linear regression framework with the genotypes as inputs and the phenotype as output , our proposed method employs a sparsity-enforcing Laplacian prior for the regression coefficients , augmented by a first-order Markov process along the sequence of SNPs that incorporates the prior information on the linkage disequilibrium structure",Mechanism,msa_2030904677
"The Markov-chain prior models the structural dependencies between a pair of adjacent SNPs , and allows us to look for association SNPs in a coupled manner , combining strength from multiple nearby SNPs",Mechanism,msa_2030904677

"These models , which are known as building information models ( BIMs ) , are often constructed using dense , three dimensional ( 3D ) point measurements obtained from laser scanners",Background,msa_2033552406
"Laser scanners can rapidly capture the as-is conditions of a facility , which may differ significantly from the design drawings",Background,msa_2033552406
"Currently , the conversion from laser scan data to BIM is primarily a manual operation , and it is labor-intensive and can be error-prone",Purpose,msa_2033552406
This paper presents a method,Mechanism,msa_2033552406

"Our algorithm is capable of identifying and modeling the main visible structural components of an indoor environment ( walls , floors , ceilings , windows , and doorways ) despite the presence of significant clutter and occlusion , which occur frequently in natural indoor environments",Mechanism,msa_2033552406
Our method begins by extracting planar patches from a voxelized version of the input point cloud,Mechanism,msa_2033552406
"The algorithm learns the unique features of different types of surfaces and the contextual relationships between them and uses this knowledge to automatically label patches as walls , ceilings , or floors",Mechanism,msa_2033552406
"Then , we perform a detailed analysis of the recognized surfaces to locate openings , such as windows and doorways",Mechanism,msa_2033552406
This process uses visibility reasoning to fuse measurements from different scan locations and to identify occluded regions and holes in the surface,Mechanism,msa_2033552406
"Next , we use a learning algorithm to intelligently estimate the shape of window and doorway openings even when partially occluded",Mechanism,msa_2033552406

topology estimation approach for the smart grid,Purpose,msa_2034670099
"Specifically , we first introduce the data-driven topology estimation problem",Mechanism,msa_2034670099
"Then , a novel Logistic Kernel Regression is proposed in a Bayesian framework based on Nearest Neighbors search",Mechanism,msa_2034670099
"Notably , unlike many machine learning approaches that do not account for physical constraints , and distinctive from deterministic engineering modeling defined solely by physical laws , this paper for the first time combines the two into one single regression modeling for topology estimation",Mechanism,msa_2034670099
Simulation,Method,msa_2034670099
results of the proposed method show that the new method produces a topology estimate excelling the current industrial approach,Findings,msa_2034670099

Real-time captioning enables deaf and hard of hearing ( DHH ) people to follow classroom lectures and other aural speech by converting it into visual text with less than a five second delay,Background,msa_2038943390
Keeping the delay short allows end-users to follow and participate in conversations,Purpose,msa_2038943390
This article focuses on the fundamental problem that makes real-time captioning difficult : sequential keyboard typing is much slower than speaking,Purpose,msa_2038943390
"We first surveyed the audio characteristics of 240 one-hour-long captioned lectures on YouTube , such as speed and duration of speaking bursts",Method,msa_2038943390
"We then analyzed how these characteristics impact caption generation and readability , considering specifically our human-powered collaborative captioning approach",Method,msa_2038943390
We note that most of these characteristics are also present in more general domains,Method,msa_2038943390
"For our caption comparison evaluation , we transcribed a classroom lecture in real-time using all three captioning approaches",Method,msa_2038943390
We recruited 48 participants ( 24 DHH ) to watch these classroom transcripts in an eye-tracking laboratory,Method,msa_2038943390
"We presented these captions in a randomized , balanced order",Method,msa_2038943390
We show that both hearing and DHH participants preferred and followed collaborative captions better than those generated by automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) or professionals due to the more consistent flow of the resulting captions,Findings,msa_2038943390
Event detection in social media is an important but challenging problem,Background,msa_2038943544
"Most existing approaches are based on burst detection , topic modeling , or clustering techniques , which can not naturally model the implicit heterogeneous network structure in social media",Purpose,msa_2038943544
"As a result , only limited information , such as terms and geographic locations , can be used",Purpose,msa_2038943544
"This paper presents Non-Parametric Heterogeneous Graph Scan ( NPHGS ) , a new approach that considers the entire heterogeneous network",Mechanism,msa_2038943544
for event detection,Purpose,msa_2038943544
": we first model the network as a `` sensor '' network , in which each node senses its `` neighborhood environment '' and reports an empirical p-value measuring its current level of anomalousness for each time interval ( e",Mechanism,msa_2038943544
", hour or day )",Mechanism,msa_2038943544
"Then , we efficiently maximize a nonparametric scan statistic over connected subgraphs to identify the most anomalous network clusters",Mechanism,msa_2038943544
"Finally , the event represented by each cluster is summarized with information such as type of event , geographical locations , time , and participants",Mechanism,msa_2038943544
"As a case study , we consider two applications using Twitter data , civil unrest event detection and rare disease outbreak detection ,",Method,msa_2038943544
Clustering is one of the fundamental data mining tasks,Background,msa_2039161254
"While traditional clustering techniques assign each object to a single cluster only , in many applications it has been observed that objects might belong to multiple clusters with different degrees",Purpose,msa_2039161254
"In this work , we present a Bayesian framework",Mechanism,msa_2039161254
to tackle the challenge of mixed membership clustering for vector data,Purpose,msa_2039161254
We exploit the ideas of subspace clustering where the relevance of dimensions might be different for each cluster,Mechanism,msa_2039161254
"Combining the relevance of the dimensions with the cluster membership degree of the objects , we propose a novel type of mixture model able to represent data containing mixed membership subspace clusters",Mechanism,msa_2039161254
"For learning our model ,",Purpose,msa_2039161254
we develop an efficient algorithm based on variational inference allowing easy parallelization,Mechanism,msa_2039161254
In our empirical study on synthetic and real data,Method,msa_2039161254
Monte Carlo simulation ( MCS ) is a numerical method to solve the probabilistic load flow ( PLF ) problem,Background,msa_2039895419
"Comparing to analytical methods , MCS for PLF has advantages such as flexibility , general purpose , able to deal with large nonlinearity and large variances , and embarrassingly parallelizable",Background,msa_2039895419
"However , MCS also suffers from low convergence speed and high computational burden , especially for problems with multiple random variables",Purpose,msa_2039895419
"In this paper , we proposed a Quasi-Monte Carlo ( QMC ) based method",Mechanism,msa_2039895419
to solve the PLF for radial distribution network,Purpose,msa_2039895419
QMC uses samples from low-discrepancy sequence intended to cover the high dimension random sample space as uniformly as possible,Mechanism,msa_2039895419
"The QMC method is particularly suitable for the high dimension problems with low effective dimensions , and has been successfully used to solve large scale problems in econometrics and statistical circuit design",Mechanism,msa_2039895419
"In this paper , we showed that the PLF for radial distribution system has the similar properties and can be a good candidate for QMC method",Findings,msa_2039895419
The proposed method possesses the advantage of MCS method and significantly increases the convergence rate and overall speed,Mechanism,msa_2039895419

People spend an enormous amount of time searching for and saving information online,Background,msa_2040090977
Existing tools capture only a small portion of the cognitive processing a user engages in while making sense of a new domain,Background,msa_2040090977
In this paper we introduce a novel interface,Mechanism,msa_2040090977
for capturing online information in a structured but lightweight way,Purpose,msa_2040090977
We use this interface as a platform,Mechanism,msa_2040090977
to experimentally characterize the costs and benefits of structuring information during the sensemaking process,Method,msa_2040090977
"Our results contribute empirical knowledge relevant to theories of information seeking and sensemaking ,",Findings,msa_2040090977
ABSTRACT Multiple ultrasonic guided -wave modes propagating along a pipe travel with different velocities which are themselves a function of frequency,Background,msa_2040303416
Reflections from the features of the structure ( e,Background,msa_2040303416
", boundaries , pipe welding , damage , etc",Background,msa_2040303416
") , and their complex s uperposition , adds to the complexity of guided -waves",Background,msa_2040303416
Guided -wave based damage d iagnosis of pipelines becomes even more challenging when environmental and operational conditions ( EOCs ) vary ( e,Background,msa_2040303416
", temperature , flow rate , inner pressure , etc",Background,msa_2040303416
),Background,msa_2040303416
These complexities make guided -wave based damage diagnosis of operating pipelines a challenging task,Background,msa_2040303416
"This paper reviews the approaches to -date addressing these challenges , and highlights the preferred characteristics of a method that simplifies guided -wa ve signals for damage diagnosis purposes",Purpose,msa_2040303416
A method is proposed,Mechanism,msa_2040303416
"to extract a sparse subset of guided -wave signals in time -domain ,",Purpose,msa_2040303416
while retaining optimal damage information for detection purpose,Mechanism,msa_2040303416
"In this paper , the general concept of this method is proved",Findings,msa_2040303416
t hrough an extensive set of experiments,Method,msa_2040303416
"Effects of temperature variation on detection performnce of the proposed method , and on discriminatory power of the extracted damage -sensitive features are investigated",Method,msa_2040303416
This paper reports the design and development of an HTML5-empowered Virtual Sensor Editor ( VSE ) over Internet of Things cloud,Mechanism,msa_2040354577
VSE is a scalable tool,Mechanism,msa_2040354577
"that allows users to design virtual sensors with user-defined dataflow logic ,",Purpose,msa_2040354577
"by visually aggregating existing sensors , either physical sensors or user-defined virtual sensors",Mechanism,msa_2040354577
"VSE supports a real-time and historical visualization of sensor values and analytical studies , and is a cross-platform and customizable tool equipped with ability to support verifiable sensor data service compos ability",Mechanism,msa_2040354577
A discussion on design decisions is presented,Mechanism,msa_2040354577
Our preliminary work has been applied to NASA Sustainability Base for Smart Building monitoring,Method,msa_2040354577
Sensor selection in nonparametric decentralized detection is investigated,Purpose,msa_2040375412
"Kernel-based minimization framework with a weighted kernel is adopted , where the kernel weight parameters represent sensors ' contributions to decision making",Mechanism,msa_2040375412
L 1 regularization on weight parameters is introduced into the risk function so that the resulting optimal decision rule contains a sparse vector of nonzero weight parameters,Mechanism,msa_2040375412
"In this way , sensor selection is naturally performed because only sensors corresponding to nonzero weight parameters contribute to decision making",Mechanism,msa_2040375412
A gradient projection algorithm and a Gauss-Seidel algorithm are developed to jointly perform weight selection ( i,Mechanism,msa_2040375412
", sensor selection ) and optimize decision rules",Mechanism,msa_2040375412
Both algorithms are shown to converge to critical points for this non-convex optimization problem,Mechanism,msa_2040375412

ABSTRACT Guided waves can propagate long distances and are sensitive to subtle structural damage,Background,msa_2043313153
"Guided-wave based damage localization often requires extracting the scatter signal ( s ) produced by damage , which is typically obtained by subtracting an intact baseline record from a record to be tested",Background,msa_2043313153
"However , in practical applications , environmental and operational conditions ( EOC ) dramatically affect guided wave si gnals",Background,msa_2043313153
"In this case , the baseline subtraction process can no longer perfectly remove the baseline , thereby defeating localization algorithms",Background,msa_2043313153
"In previous work , we showed that singular value decomposition ( SVD ) can be used to detect the presence of damage under large EOC variations , because it can differentiate the tr ends of damage from other EO C variations",Background,msa_2043313153
"This capability of differentiation implies that SVD can also robustly extract a scatter signal , originating from damage in the structure , that is not affected by temperature vari ation",Purpose,msa_2043313153
This process allows us to extract a scatterer signal without the challenges associated with traditional temperature compensation and baseline subtraction routines,Purpose,msa_2043313153
"In this work , we use to approach",Mechanism,msa_2043313153
"to localize structural damage in large , spatially and temporally varying EOCs",Purpose,msa_2043313153
We collect pitch-catch records from randomly placed PZT transducers on an aluminum plate while undergoing temperature variations,Mechanism,msa_2043313153
Damage is introduced to the plate during the monitoring period,Mechanism,msa_2043313153
"We then use our SVD method to extract the scatter signal from the records , and use the scatter signal to localize damage using the delay-and-sum method",Mechanism,msa_2043313153
"To compare results , we also apply several temperature compensation methods to the records and then perform baseline subtraction",Method,msa_2043313153
We use exponential start time clustering,Mechanism,msa_2044112344
to design faster parallel graph algorithms involving distances,Purpose,msa_2044112344
Testing Cyber-Physical Systems is becoming increasingly challenging as they incorporate advanced autonomy features,Background,msa_2044286462
We investigate using an external runtime monitor as a partial test oracle,Mechanism,msa_2044286462
to detect violations of critical system behavioral requirements on an automotive development platform,Purpose,msa_2044286462
"Despite limited source code access and using only existing network messages , we were able to monitor a hardware-in-the-loop vehicle simulator and analyze prototype vehicle log data to detect violations of high-level critical properties",Mechanism,msa_2044286462
Interface robustness testing was useful to further exercise the monitors,Mechanism,msa_2044286462
"Disparity tuning measured in the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) is described well by the disparity energy model , but not all aspects of disparity tuning are fully explained by the model",Background,msa_2044838418
Such deviations from the disparity energy model provide us with insight into how network interactions may play a role in disparity processing and help to solve the stereo correspondence problem,Purpose,msa_2044838418
"Here , we propose a neuronal circuit model with recurrent connections",Mechanism,msa_2044838418
that provides a simple account of the observed deviations,Purpose,msa_2044838418
"The model is based on recurrent connections inferred from neurophysiological observations on spike timing correlations , and is in good accord with existing data on disparity tuning dynamics",Mechanism,msa_2044838418
We further performed two additional experiments to test predictions of the model,Method,msa_2044838418
"First , we increased the size of stimuli to drive more neurons and provide a stronger recurrent input",Method,msa_2044838418
Our model predicted sharper disparity tuning for larger stimuli,Findings,msa_2044838418
"Second , we displayed anti-correlated stereograms , where dots of opposite luminance polarity are matched between the left- and right-eye images and result in inverted disparity tuning in the disparity energy model",Method,msa_2044838418
"In this case , our model predicted reduced sharpening and strength of inverted disparity tuning",Findings,msa_2044838418
For both experiments,Method,msa_2044838418
Behavioral researchers spend considerable amount of time coding video data to systematically extract meaning from subtle human actions and emotions,Background,msa_2045515072
"In this paper , we present Glance , a tool",Mechanism,msa_2045515072
"that allows researchers to rapidly query , sample , and analyze large video datasets for behavioral events that are hard to detect automatically",Purpose,msa_2045515072
Glance takes advantage of the parallelism available in paid online crowds to interpret natural language queries and then aggregates responses in a summary view of the video data,Mechanism,msa_2045515072
"Glance provides analysts with rapid responses when initially exploring a dataset , and reliable codings when refining an analysis",Mechanism,msa_2045515072
Our,Findings,msa_2045515072
experiments,Method,msa_2045515072
"show that Glance can code nearly 50 minutes of video in 5 minutes by recruiting over 60 workers simultaneously , and can get initial feedback to analysts in under 10 seconds for most clips",Findings,msa_2045515072
"We present and compare new methods for accurately aggregating the input of multiple workers marking the spans of events in video data , and for measuring the quality of their coding in real-time before a baseline is established by measuring the variance between workers",Mechanism,msa_2045515072
"Glance 's rapid responses to natural language queries , feedback regarding question ambiguity and anomalies in the data , and ability to build on prior context in followup queries allow users to have a conversation-like interaction with their data",Findings,msa_2045515072
Inference of gene interaction networks from expression data usually focuses on either supervised or unsupervised edge prediction from a single data source,Background,msa_2045565311
"However , in many real world applications , multiple data sources , such as microarray and ISH ( in situ hybridization ) measurements of mRNA abundances , are available to offer multiview information about the same set of genes",Purpose,msa_2045565311
We propose ISH,Mechanism,msa_2045565311
to estimate a gene interaction network that is consistent with such multiple data sources,Purpose,msa_2045565311
", which are expected to reflect the same underlying relationships between the genes",Mechanism,msa_2045565311
NP-MuScL casts the network estimation problem as estimating the structure of a sparse undirected graphical model,Mechanism,msa_2045565311
"We use the semiparametric Gaussian copula to model the distribution of the different data sources , with the different copulas sharing the same precision ( i",Mechanism,msa_2045565311
", inverse covariance ) matrix , and we present an efficient algorithm to estimate such a model in the high-dimensional scenario",Mechanism,msa_2045565311
Results are reported,Findings,msa_2045565311
on synthetic data,Method,msa_2045565311
", where NP-MuScL outperforms baseline algorithms significantly , even in the presence of noisy data sources",Findings,msa_2045565311
"Experiments are also run on two real-world scenarios : two yeast microarray datasets and three Drosophila embryonic gene expression datasets ,",Method,msa_2045565311
Objective,Purpose,msa_2045572716
Intracortical braincomputer interface ( BCI ) decoders are typically retrained daily to maintain stable performance,Background,msa_2045572716
Self-recalibrating decoders aim to remove the burden this may present in the clinic by training themselves autonomously during normal use but have only been developed for continuous control,Purpose,msa_2045572716
Here we address the problem for discrete decoding ( classifiers ),Purpose,msa_2045572716
Approach,Method,msa_2045572716
We recorded threshold crossings from 96-electrode arrays implanted in the motor cortex of two rhesus macaques performing center-out reaches in 7 directions over 41 and 36 separate days spanning 48 and 58days in total for offline analysis,Method,msa_2045572716
Main results,Findings,msa_2045572716
"We show that for the purposes of developing a self-recalibrating classifier , tuning parameters can be considered as fixed within days and that parameters on the same electrode move up and down together between days",Mechanism,msa_2045572716
"Further , drift is constrained across time , which is reflected in the performance of a standard classifier which does not progressively worsen if it is not retrained daily , though overall performance is reduced by more than 10 % compared to a daily retrained classifier",Findings,msa_2045572716
Two novel self-recalibrating classifiers,Mechanism,msa_2045572716
produce a increase in classification accuracy over that achieved by the non-retrained classifier to nearly recover the performance of the daily retrained classifier,Findings,msa_2045572716
"Low-cost genetic sequencing , coupled with novel social media platforms and visualization techniques , present a new frontier for scientific participation , whereby people can learn , share , and act on data embedded within their own bodies",Background,msa_2046318477
"Our study of 23andMe , a popular genetic testing service ,",Method,msa_2046318477
"reveals how users make sense of and contextualize their genetic results , critique and evaluate the underlying research , and reflect on the broader implications of genetic testing",Purpose,msa_2046318477
We frame user groups as citizen science publics groups that coalesce around scientific issues and work towards resolving shared concerns,Method,msa_2046318477
"Our findings show that personal genetics serves as a site for public engagement with science , whereby communities of biological citizens creatively interpret , debate , and act on professional research",Findings,msa_2046318477
"In the real-world unconstrained face recognition scenarios , automatic facial landmarking scheme using the active shape model ( ASM ) usually gives non-ideal results , especially at the facial boundary",Background,msa_2046873811
"This is because the local subspace methods such as the principal component analysis ( PCA ) used in the ASM does not properly discern skin texture and background with very similar photometric and textual properties , thus fails to accurately locate the facial boundary",Background,msa_2046873811
"In this work , we have novelly developed a robust image statistics approach",Mechanism,msa_2046873811
to efficiently refine the landmarks on facial boundary,Purpose,msa_2046873811
"Moreover , with the aid of banana wavelets to highlight the facial boundary , our proposed approach can deal with even more difficult task",Mechanism,msa_2046873811
This algorithm can dramatically increase the accuracy of landmarks on facial boundary for unconstrained facial images with minimum computational expense since this method is purely based on image statistics with no training stages involved at all,Mechanism,msa_2046873811
We have shown the effectiveness of our proposed methods,Findings,msa_2046873811
on the GBU database,Method,msa_2046873811
One of the most significant challenges for many online communities is increasing members ' contributions over time,Background,msa_2047659612
"Prior studies on peer feedback in online communities have suggested its impact on contribution , but have been limited by their correlational nature",Background,msa_2047659612
"In this paper , we conducted a field experiment on Wikipedia",Method,msa_2047659612
"to test the effects of different feedback types ( positive feedback , negative feedback , directive feedback , and social feedback ) on members ' contribution",Purpose,msa_2047659612
"Our results characterize the effects of different feedback types , and suggest trade-offs in the effects of feedback between the focal task and general motivation , as well as differences in how newcomers and experienced editors respond to peer feedback",Findings,msa_2047659612
"In commercial-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) multi-core systems , the execution times of tasks become hard to predict because of contention on shared resources in the memory hierarchy",Background,msa_2048242615
"In particular , a task running in one processor core can delay the execution of another task running in another processor core",Background,msa_2048242615
This is due to the fact that tasks can access data in the same cache set shared among processor cores or in the same memory bank in the DRAM memory ( or both ),Background,msa_2048242615
Such cache and bank interference effects have motivated the need to create isolation mechanisms for resources accessed by more than one task,Background,msa_2048242615
One popular isolation mechanism is cache coloring that divides the cache into multiple partitions,Background,msa_2048242615
"With cache coloring , each task can be assigned exclusive cache partitions , thereby preventing cache interference from other tasks",Background,msa_2048242615
"Similarly , bank coloring allows assigning exclusive bank partitions to tasks",Background,msa_2048242615
"While cache coloring and some bank coloring mechanisms have been studied separately , interactions between the two schemes have not been studied",Background,msa_2048242615
"Specifically , while memory accesses to two different bank colors do not interfere with each other at the bank level , they may interact at the cache level",Background,msa_2048242615
"Similarly , two different cache colors avoid cache interference but may not prevent bank interference",Background,msa_2048242615
Therefore it is necessary to coordinate cache and bank coloring approaches,Purpose,msa_2048242615
"In this paper , we present a coordinated cache and bank coloring scheme",Mechanism,msa_2048242615
that is designed to prevent cache and bank interference simultaneously,Purpose,msa_2048242615
We also developed color allocation algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2048242615
for configuring a virtual memory system to support our scheme,Purpose,msa_2048242615
which has been implemented in the Linux kernel,Method,msa_2048242615
"In our experiments ,",Method,msa_2048242615
Anecdotal evidence and scholarly research have shown that Internet users may regret some of their online disclosures,Background,msa_2048723827
"To help individuals avoid such regrets ,",Purpose,msa_2048723827
we designed two modifications to the Facebook web interface,Mechanism,msa_2048723827
that nudge users to consider the content and audience of their online disclosures more carefully,Purpose,msa_2048723827
We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users,Method,msa_2048723827
"We analyzed participants ' interactions with the nudges , the content of their posts , and opinions collected through surveys",Method,msa_2048723827
"We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden ; however , introducing a time delay before publishing users ' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying",Findings,msa_2048723827
"On balance , some participants found the nudges helpful while others found them unnecessary or overly intrusive",Findings,msa_2048723827

Virus capsid assembly has been a powerful model system for biological self-assembly in general due to the combination of experimental tractability but complicated pathway space,Background,msa_2049636203
"Detailed experimental resolution of viral assembly processes , however , has so far proven impossible",Background,msa_2049636203
"Computational approaches have provided a solution , allowing us to learn models of assembly consistent with indirect experimental measures of bulk in vitro assembly and thus fill the gaps between coarse-grained experimental measurements and detailed theoretical models",Background,msa_2049636203
"Nonetheless , accurate simulation predictions rely on building accurate models , which has proven to be a challenging data-fitting problem due to the high computational cost of simulating capsid assembly trajectories , high stochastic noise inherent to the system , and limited and generally noisy experimental data available",Purpose,msa_2049636203
"Here , we describe progress in learning accurate kinetic models of capsid assembly systems by computationally fitting assembly simulations to experimental data",Mechanism,msa_2049636203
We previously developed a heuristic optimization approach to learn rate parameters of coat-coat interactions by minimizing the deviation between real and simulated static light scattering measurements,Background,msa_2049636203
We now show that one can substantially improve fitting to light scattering data,Purpose,msa_2049636203
"using an alternative class of methods called derivative-free optimization , designed",Mechanism,msa_2049636203
"to deal with challenges of costly , noisy computations",Purpose,msa_2049636203
"Simultaneously , simulated exploration of potential alternative sources of experimental data for monitoring bulk assembly ( e",Method,msa_2049636203
"g , non-covalent mass spectrometry )",Method,msa_2049636203
suggest that other feasible technologies providing richer data on assembly progress can more precisely pin down true parameters and assembly pathways,Findings,msa_2049636203

Automatic understanding of human activities is a huge challenge in multimedia analysis field,Background,msa_2050075608
"This challenge is especially critical in small-scale activities , such as finger motions , and activities in complex scenes",Background,msa_2050075608
"For typical camera views , both global feature and local feature analysis methods are unsuitable",Background,msa_2050075608
"To solve this problem , many studies focus on using spatio-temporal features and feature selection methods to get video representation",Background,msa_2050075608
"However , these spatio-temporal features are problematic for two reasons",Purpose,msa_2050075608
"First , we are not sure whether these features are meaningful foreground or noise",Purpose,msa_2050075608
"Second , we are unable to foresee where an activity will occur based on these features",Purpose,msa_2050075608
"Therefore , a biological feature selection method is needed to reorganize these spatio-temporal features and represent the video in a feature space",Purpose,msa_2050075608
"In this paper , we propose a graph based Co-Attention model",Mechanism,msa_2050075608
to select more efficient features for activity analysis,Purpose,msa_2050075608
"Without reducing the dimensionality , our Co-Attention model considers the number of interest points",Mechanism,msa_2050075608
"Our model is derived from correlations among individual tiny activities , whose salient regions are identified by combining an integrated top-down and bottom-up visual attention model , and a motion attention model built by spatio-temporal features instead of optical flow directly",Mechanism,msa_2050075608
"Different from typical attention models , the Co-Attention model allows multiple regions of interest in video co-existing for further analysis",Mechanism,msa_2050075608
"Experimental results on the KTH dataset , YouTube dataset and a new tiny activity dataset , Pump dataset which consist of visual observation data from patients operating an infusion pump ,",Method,msa_2050075608
"Machine-learning ( ML ) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices , making medical diagnoses , and facial recognition",Background,msa_2051267297
"In a model inversion attack , recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al",Background,msa_2051267297

") We prove attractive properties of this , such as symmetry and monotonicity",Mechanism,msa_2058507349
We develop computational methods for solving the model,Mechanism,msa_2058507349
"( We also develop optimization models with recourse , but they are not computationally practical",Mechanism,msa_2058507349

"We present experiments both on the homogeneous items case and the case of FCC incentive auctions , where we use real interference constraint data to get a fully faithful model of feasibility",Method,msa_2058507349
Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads ( TCLs ) have been shown to hold promise as demand response resources,Background,msa_2058559708
"However , the evaluation of these promises has relied on simulations of individual TCLs that make important assumptions about the thermal dynamics and properties of the loads , the end-users interactions with individual TCLs and the disturbances to their operation",Purpose,msa_2058559708
"In this paper , we first propose a data-driven modeling strategy",Mechanism,msa_2058559708
"to simulate individual TCLsspecifically , household refrigeration units ( HRUs ) that allows us to relax some of these assumptions and evaluate the validity of the approaches proposed to date",Purpose,msa_2058559708
"Specifically , we fit probability distributions to a year-long dataset of power measurements for HRUs and use these models to create more realistic simulations",Mechanism,msa_2058559708
We then derive the aggregate system equations using a bottom-up approach that results in a more flexible [ linear time invariant ( LTI ) ] system,Mechanism,msa_2058559708
"Finally , we quantify the plant-model mismatch and evaluate the proposed strategy with the more realistic simulation",Method,msa_2058559708
We show an algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2058706632
for solving symmetric diagonally dominant ( SDD ) linear systems with m non-zero entries to a relative error of e in O ( m log 1/2 n log c n log ( 1/ e ) ) time,Purpose,msa_2058706632
"Our approach follows the recursive preconditioning framework , which aims to reduce graphs to trees using iterative methods",Mechanism,msa_2058706632
We improve two key components of this framework : random sampling and tree embeddings,Mechanism,msa_2058706632
"Both of these components are used in a variety of other algorithms , and our approach also extends to the dual problem of computing electrical flows",Mechanism,msa_2058706632
We show that preconditioners constructed by random sampling can perform well without meeting the standard requirements of iterative methods,Mechanism,msa_2058706632
"In the graph setting , this leads to ultra-sparsifiers that have optimal behavior in expectation",Mechanism,msa_2058706632
The improved running time makes previous low stretch embedding algorithms the running time bottleneck in this framework,Mechanism,msa_2058706632
"In our analysis , we relax the requirement of these embeddings to snowflake spaces",Mechanism,msa_2058706632
We then obtain a two-pass approach algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2058706632
for constructing optimal embeddings in snowflake spaces that runs in O ( m log log n ) time,Purpose,msa_2058706632
Social media offers a targeted way for mainstream technology companies to communicate with people with disabilities about the accessibility problems that they face,Background,msa_2058812096
"While companies have started to engage with users on social media about accessibility , they differ greatly in terms of their approach and how well they support the ways in which their users want to engage",Purpose,msa_2058812096
"In this paper , we describe current use patterns of six corporate accessibility teams and their users on Twitter , and present an analysis of these interactions",Method,msa_2058812096
"We find that while many users want to interact directly with companies about accessibility , companies prefer to redirect them to other channels and use Twitter for broadcast messages promoting their accessibility work instead",Findings,msa_2058812096
"Our analysis demonstrates that users want to use social media to become part of the process of improving accessibility of mainstream technology ,",Findings,msa_2058812096
"In this paper , we present two conceptual frameworks for GPU applications",Mechanism,msa_2059065946
to adjust their task execution times based on total workload,Purpose,msa_2059065946
These frameworks enable smart GPU resource management when many applications share GPU resources while the workloads of those applications vary,Mechanism,msa_2059065946
Application developers can explicitly adjust the number of GPU cores depending on their needs,Mechanism,msa_2059065946
"An implicit adjustment will be supported by a run-time framework , which dynamically allocates the number of cores to tasks based on the total workload",Mechanism,msa_2059065946
The runtime support of the proposed system can be realized using functions which measure the execution times of the tasks on GPU and change the number of GPU cores,Mechanism,msa_2059065946
"For very large dynamic networks , monitoring the behavior of a subset of agents provides an efficient framework for detecting changes in network topology",Background,msa_2059222769
"For example , in mobile caller networks with millions of subscribers , we would like to monitor the dynamics of the smallest possible set of subscribers and still be able to infer abnormal events that occur over the entire network",Purpose,msa_2059222769
"In general , we assume that the temporal behavior of a network agent is captured by a ( local ) dynamic state , which may reflect either a physical property such as the number of connections or an abstract quantity such as opinions or beliefs",Mechanism,msa_2059222769
"Further , assuming coupled linear inter-agent dynamics in which the local agent states evolve as weighted linear combinations of the neighboring agents ' states , we focus on tracking network-wide agent dynamics",Mechanism,msa_2059222769
"Due to the large-scale nature of the problem , directly monitoring data streams of the state dynamics for every individual agent is infeasible",Mechanism,msa_2059222769
To address this issue,Purpose,msa_2059222769
", we propose a method that identifies a relatively small subset of agents whose state streams enable us",Mechanism,msa_2059222769
"to reconstruct the dynamic state evolution of all the network agents at any given time and , simultaneously , detect agent departure events",Purpose,msa_2059222769
"Using structural properties of the coupled inter-agent dynamics , we provide an algorithm , which is polynomial in the number of agents ,",Mechanism,msa_2059222769
to identify a small subset of agents that ensures such network observability regardless of any agent leaving,Purpose,msa_2059222769
"In addition , we show how well-known tools in dynamic control systems may be useful for identifying abnormal events ; in particular",Background,msa_2059222769
we use a fault detection and isolation scheme,Mechanism,msa_2059222769
to identify agent departures,Purpose,msa_2059222769
"Finally , we illustrate our method and algorithms in a small test network",Method,msa_2059222769
This paper presents a computer vision algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2059599986

"To detect lateral and longitudinal lane-markings , this method applies a spatial filter emphasizing the intensity contrast between lane-marking pixels and their neighboring pixels",Mechanism,msa_2059599986
"The authors then examine the detected lane-markings to identify perpendicular , geometry layouts between longitudinal and lateral lane-markings for stop-line detection",Mechanism,msa_2059599986
"To provide reliable stop-line recognition , the authors developed an unscented Kalman filter to track the detected stop-line over frames",Mechanism,msa_2059599986

"Despite the popularity of home medical devices , serious safety concerns have been raised , because the use-errors of home medical devices have linked to a large number of fatal hazards",Purpose,msa_2059689929
"To resolve the problem ,",Purpose,msa_2059689929
we introduce a cognitive assistive system,Mechanism,msa_2059689929
to automatically monitor the use of home medical devices,Purpose,msa_2059689929
Being able to accurately recognize user operations is one of the most important functionalities of the proposed system,Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"However , even though various action recognition algorithms have been proposed in recent years , it is still unknown whether they are adequate for recognizing operations in using home medical devices",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"Since the lack of the corresponding database is the main reason causing the situation , at the first part of this paper , we present a database specially designed for studying the use of home medical devices",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"Then , we evaluate the performance of the existing approaches on the proposed database",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"Although using state-of-art approaches which have demonstrated near perfect performance in recognizing certain general human actions , we observe significant performance drop when applying it to recognize device operations",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
We conclude that the tiny action involved in using devices is one of the most important reasons leading to the performance decrease,Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"To accurately recognize tiny actions , it 's critical to focus on where the target action happens , namely the region of interest ( ROI ) and have more elaborate action modeling based on the ROI",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
"Therefore , in the second part of this paper , we introduce a simple but effective approach to estimating ROI for recognizing tiny actions",Mechanism,msa_2059689929
The key idea of this method is to analyze the correlation between an action and the sub-regions of a frame,Mechanism,msa_2059689929
The estimated ROI is then used as a filter for building more accurate action representations,Mechanism,msa_2059689929
Experimental,Method,msa_2059689929
"Given a real world graph , how should we lay-out its edges ? How can we compress it ? These questions are closely related , and the typical approach so far is to find clique-like communities , like the cavemen graph , and compress them",Background,msa_2060778826
"We show that the block-diagonal mental image of the cavemen graph is the wrong paradigm , in full agreement with earlier results that real world graphs have no good cuts",Purpose,msa_2060778826
"Instead , we propose to envision graphs as a collection of hubs connecting spokes , with super-hubs connecting the hubs , and so on , recursively",Purpose,msa_2060778826
"Based on the idea , we propose the SlashBurn method to recursively split a graph into hubs and spokes connected only by the hubs",Mechanism,msa_2060778826
"We also propose techniques to select the hubs and give an ordering to the spokes , in addition to the basic SlashBurn",Mechanism,msa_2060778826
We give theoretical analysis of the proposed hub selection methods,Mechanism,msa_2060778826
"Our view point has several advantages : ( a ) it avoids the no good cuts problem , ( b ) it gives better compression , and ( c ) it leads to faster execution times for matrix-vector operations , which are the back-bone of most graph processing tools",Mechanism,msa_2060778826

Big data has been becoming ubiquitous and applied in numerous fields recently,Background,msa_2061890139
The challenges to solve a large-scale machine learning problem in big data scenario generally lie in three aspects,Purpose,msa_2061890139
"Firstly , a proposed machine learning algorithm has to be appropriated for the distributed optimization problem",Purpose,msa_2061890139
"Secondly , it needs a platform for the distributed implementation",Purpose,msa_2061890139
"Finally , the communication delays different machines may cause problems in convergence even though the non-distributed algorithm shows a good convergence rate",Purpose,msa_2061890139
"In order to solve these challenges ,",Purpose,msa_2061890139
we propose a new machine learning approach named Distributed Class-dependent Feature Analysis ( DCFA ),Mechanism,msa_2061890139
", to combine the advantages of sparse representation in an over-complete dictionary",Purpose,msa_2061890139

Braincomputer interfaces ( BCIs ) are a promising technology for restoring motor ability to paralyzed patients,Background,msa_2062317132
Spiking-based BCIs have successfully been used in clinical trials to control multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices,Background,msa_2062317132
"Current implementations of these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step , which is an obstacle to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic",Background,msa_2062317132
"A viable alternative is to avoid spike-sorting , treating all threshold crossings of the voltage waveform on an electrode as coming from one putative neuron",Purpose,msa_2062317132
"It is not known , however , how much decoding information might be lost by ignoring spike identity",Purpose,msa_2062317132
Approach,Mechanism,msa_2062317132
We present a full analysis of the effects of spike-sorting schemes on decoding performance,Mechanism,msa_2062317132
"Specifically , we compare how well two common decoders , the optimal linear estimator and the Kalman filter , reconstruct the arm movements of non-human primates performing reaching tasks , when receiving input from various sorting schemes",Mechanism,msa_2062317132
"The schemes we tested included : using threshold crossings without spike-sorting ; expert-sorting discarding the noise ; expert-sorting , including the noise as if it were another neuron ; and automatic spike-sorting using waveform features",Mechanism,msa_2062317132
"We also decoded from a joint statistical model for the waveforms and tuning curves , which does not involve an explicit spike-sorting step",Mechanism,msa_2062317132
Main results,Findings,msa_2062317132
Discarding the threshold crossings that can not be assigned to neurons degrades decoding :,Method,msa_2062317132

A common approach in crowdsourcing is to break large tasks into small microtasks so that they can be parallelized across many crowd workers and so that redundant work can be more easily compared for quality control,Background,msa_2062742763
"In practice , this can result in the microtasks being presented out of their natural order and often introduces delays between individual microtasks",Purpose,msa_2062742763
"In this paper , we demonstrate in a study of 338 crowd workers",Method,msa_2062742763
that non-sequential microtasks and the introduction of delays significantly decreases worker performance,Findings,msa_2062742763
"We show that interruptions where a large delay occurs between two related tasks can cause up to a 102 % slowdown in completion time , and interruptions where workers are asked to perform different tasks in sequence can slow down completion time by 57 %",Findings,msa_2062742763

We establish a sufficient condition on the $ \gamma $ s that guarantees survival of the fittestonly one strain survives,Mechanism,msa_2063366119
"We propose an ordering of the weighted digraphs , the $ \star $ -order , and show that if the weighted digraph of strain $ y $ is $ \star $ -dominated by the weighted digraph of strain $ x $ , then $ y $ dies out in the long run",Mechanism,msa_2063366119
We prove that the orbits of the ODE accumulate to an attractor that captures the survival of the fittest phenomenon,Mechanism,msa_2063366119
"Due to the coupled nonlinear high-dimension nature of the ODEs , there is no natural Lyapunov function to study their global qualitative behavior",Mechanism,msa_2063366119

We study a mechanism design version of matching computation in graphs that models,Mechanism,msa_2064135158
the game played by hospitals participating in pairwise kidney exchange programs,Purpose,msa_2064135158
We present a new randomized matching mechanism for two agents which is truthful in expectation and,Mechanism,msa_2064135158
Self-powered systems that interact with the physical world require computing platforms with predictable timing behavior and a low energy demand,Background,msa_2064540015
Energy consumption can be reduced by choosing energy-efficient designs for both hardware and software components of the platform,Purpose,msa_2064540015
We leverage the state-of-the-art in hardware design by adopting Heterogeneous Multi-core Processors with support for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling and Dynamic Power Management,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
"Through experiments on one such platform ,",Method,msa_2064540015
we expose the hardware characteristics that violate assumptions of conventional energy models,Findings,msa_2064540015
and propose a revised model suitable,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
for identifying the energy-efficient frequency range,Purpose,msa_2064540015
We then address the problem of allocating real-time software components onto heterogeneous cores such that total energy is minimized,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
Our approach is to start from an analytically justified target load distribution and find a task assignment heuristic that approximates it,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
"Our analysis shows that neither balancing the load nor assigning all load to the `` cheapest '' core is the best load distribution strategy , unless the cores are extremely alike or extremely different",Findings,msa_2064540015
The optimal load distribution is then formulated as a solution to a convex optimization problem,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
A heuristic that approximates this load distribution and an alternative method that leverages the solution explicitly are proposed as viable task assignment methods,Mechanism,msa_2064540015
Poor posture and incorrect muscle usage are a leading cause of many injuries in sports and fitness,Background,msa_2064676964
"For this reason , non- invasive , fine-grained sensing and monitoring of human motion and muscles is important for mitigating injury and improving fitness efficacy",Background,msa_2064676964
Current sensing systems either de- pend on invasive techniques or unscalable approaches whose accuracy is highly dependent on body sensor placement,Background,msa_2064676964
"As a result these systems are not suitable for use in active sports or fitness training where sensing needs to be scalable , accurate and un-inhibitive to the activity being performed",Purpose,msa_2064676964
"We present MARS , a system that",Mechanism,msa_2064676964
detects both body motion and individual muscle group activity during physical human activity,Purpose,msa_2064676964
"by only using unobtrusive , non-invasive in- ertial sensors",Mechanism,msa_2064676964
"MARS not only accurately senses and recreates human motion down to the muscles , but also allows for fast personalized system setup by determining the individual identities of the instrumented muscles , obtained with minimal system training",Mechanism,msa_2064676964
"In a real world human study con- ducted to evaluate MARS ,",Method,msa_2064676964
"The openness of wireless communication and the recent development of software-defined radio technology , respectively , provide a low barrier and a wide range of capabilities for misbehavior , attacks , and defenses against attacks",Background,msa_2065483835
"In this work we present finite-energy jamming games , a game model",Mechanism,msa_2065483835
"that allows a jammer and sender to choose ( 1 ) whether to transmit or sleep , ( 2 ) a power level to transmit with , and ( 3 ) what channel to transmit on",Purpose,msa_2065483835
We also allow the jammer,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
to choose on how many channels it simultaneously attacks,Purpose,msa_2065483835
A major addition in finite-energy jamming games is that the jammer and sender both have a limited amount of energy which is drained according to the actions a player takes,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
We develop a model of our system as a zero-sum finite-horizon stochastic game with deterministic transitions,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
We leverage the zero-sum and finite-horizon properties of our model to design a simple polynomial-time algorithm to compute optimal randomized strategies for both players,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
The utility function of our game model can be decoupled into a recursive equation,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
Our algorithm exploits this fact to use dynamic programming to construct solutions in a bottom-up fashion,Mechanism,msa_2065483835
"For each state of energy levels , a linear program is solved to find Nash equilibrium strategies for the subgame",Mechanism,msa_2065483835
"With these techniques , our algorithm has only a linear dependence on the number of states , and quadratic dependence on the number of actions , allowing us to solve very large instances",Mechanism,msa_2065483835
"By computing Nash equilibria for our game models , we explore what kind of performance guarantees can be achieved both for the sender and jammer , when playing against an optimal opponent",Mechanism,msa_2065483835
"We also use the optimal strategies to simulate finite-energy jamming games and provide insights into robust communication among reconfigurable , yet energy-limited , radio systems",Mechanism,msa_2065483835
To test the performance of the optimal strategies we compare their performance with a random and adaptive strategy,Method,msa_2065483835
"Matching our intuition , the aggressiveness of an attacker is related to how much of a discount is placed on data delay",Findings,msa_2065483835
"This results in the defender often choosing to sleep despite the latency implication , because the threat of jamming is high",Findings,msa_2065483835
We also present several other findings,Findings,msa_2065483835
"Multimedia event detection ( MED ) and multimedia event recounting ( MER ) are fundamental tasks in managing large amounts of unconstrained web videos , and have attracted a lot of attention in recent years",Background,msa_2065636378
Most existing systems perform MER as a post-processing step on top of the MED results,Purpose,msa_2065636378
"In order to leverage the mutual benefits of the two tasks ,",Purpose,msa_2065636378
we propose a joint framework that simultaneously detects high-level events and localizes the indicative concepts of the events,Mechanism,msa_2065636378
"Our premise is that a good recounting algorithm should not only explain the detection result , but should also be able to assist detection in the first place",Mechanism,msa_2065636378
"Coupled in a joint optimization framework , recounting improves detection by pruning irrelevant noisy concepts while detection directs recounting to the most discriminative evidences",Mechanism,msa_2065636378
"To better utilize the powerful and interpretable semantic video representation , we segment each video into several shots and exploit the rich temporal structures at shot level",Mechanism,msa_2065636378
"The consequent computational challenge is carefully addressed through a significant improvement of the current ADMM algorithm , which , after eliminating all inner loops and equipping novel closed-form solutions for all intermediate steps , enables us to efficiently process extremely large video corpora",Mechanism,msa_2065636378
"We test the proposed method on the large scale TRECVID MEDTest 2014 and MEDTest 2013 datasets ,",Method,msa_2065636378
"Despite persistent effort , many web pages are still not accessible to everyone",Background,msa_2065757434
Fixing web accessibility problems can be complicated,Purpose,msa_2065757434
Developers need to have extensive knowledge not only of possible accessibility problems but also of approaches for fixing them,Purpose,msa_2065757434
This paper is about using the large number of accessibility issues on real websites and crowd-sourced fixes for them as a unique source of learning materials for web developers to learn how to build accessible components in a cost-efficient manner,Purpose,msa_2065757434
"In this paper , we present the design , development and study of CAN ( Composable Accessibility Infrastructure ) , a crowdsourcing infrastructure that collects web accessibility issues and their fixes , dynamically composes solutions on-the-fly , and delivers the crowd-sourced content as teaching materials",Mechanism,msa_2065757434
"Our unique CAN user interaction and system design enables end users with disabilities to both benefit from and contribute to the system without additional effort in their daily web browsing , and allows web developers to experience real accessibility issues and initiate a learning process with first-hand materials",Mechanism,msa_2065757434
CAN also provides an opportunity for data-driven discovery of the common implementation practices that cause accessibility issues,Mechanism,msa_2065757434
We show how CAN addresses a set of accessibility issues on the top 100 popular websites,Method,msa_2065757434

"We demonstrate the Acoustic Location Processing System ( ALPS ) , a platform that augments BLE proximity beacons with ultrasonic transmitters in a manner",Mechanism,msa_2066689965
that allows for precise and robust indoor localization,Purpose,msa_2066689965
"Motor cortex plays a substantial role in driving movement , yet the details underlying this control remain unresolved",Purpose,msa_2066921639
We analyzed the extent to which movement-related information could be extracted from single-trial motor cortical activity recorded while monkeys performed center-out reaching,Purpose,msa_2066921639
"Using information theoretic techniques ,",Method,msa_2066921639
we found that single units carry relatively little speed-related information compared with direction-related information,Findings,msa_2066921639
This result is not mitigated at the population level : simultaneously recorded population activity predicted speed with significantly lower accuracy relative to direction predictions,Findings,msa_2066921639
"Furthermore , a unit-dropping analysis",Method,msa_2066921639
"revealed that speed accuracy would likely remain lower than direction accuracy , even given larger populations",Findings,msa_2066921639
These results suggest that the instantaneous details of single-trial movement speed are difficult to extract using commonly assumed coding schemes,Background,msa_2066921639
"This apparent paucity of speed information takes particular importance in the context of brain-machine interfaces ( BMIs ) , which rely on extracting kinematic information from motor cortex",Background,msa_2066921639
Previous studies have highlighted subjects ' difficulties in holding a BMI cursor stable at targets,Background,msa_2066921639
"These studies , along with our finding of relatively little speed information in motor cortex ,",Background,msa_2066921639
inspired a speed-dampening Kalman filter ( SDKF ) that automatically slows the cursor upon detecting changes in decoded movement direction,Mechanism,msa_2066921639
"Effectively , SDKF",Mechanism,msa_2066921639
enhances speed control,Purpose,msa_2066921639
"by using prevalent directional signals , rather than requiring speed to be directly decoded from neural activity",Mechanism,msa_2066921639
SDKF improved success rates by a factor of 1,Findings,msa_2066921639
7 relative to a standard Kalman filter in a closed-loop BMI task requiring stable stops at targets,Findings,msa_2066921639
Traditional hard real-time scheduling algorithms require the use of the worst-case execution times to guarantee that deadlines will be met,Background,msa_2067348042
"Unfortunately , many algorithms with parameters derived from sensing the physical world suffer large variations in execution time , leading to pessimistic overall utilization , such as visual recognition tasks",Purpose,msa_2067348042
"In this article , we present ZS-QRAM , a scheduling approach that enables the use of flexible execution times and application-derived utility to tasks in order",Mechanism,msa_2067348042
to maximize total system utility,Purpose,msa_2067348042
"In particular , we provide a detailed description of the algorithm , the formal proofs for its temporal protection , and a detailed , evaluation",Mechanism,msa_2067348042
Our evaluation uses the Utility Degradation Resilience ( UDR ),Method,msa_2067348042
"showing that ZS-QRAM is able to obtain 4 as much UDR as ZSRM , a previous overbooking approach , and almost 2 as much UDR as Rate-Monotonic with Period Transformation ( RM/TP )",Findings,msa_2067348042
We then evaluate a Linux kernel module implementation of our scheduler on an Unmanned Air Vehicle ( UAV ) platform,Method,msa_2067348042
"Complex events essentially include human , scenes , objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes , so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection",Background,msa_2067936711
Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications,Background,msa_2067936711
"However , attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data",Purpose,msa_2067936711
"Hence , we propose to leverage attributes at video level ( named as video attributes in this work ) , i",Mechanism,msa_2067936711
", the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes",Mechanism,msa_2067936711
"Compared to complex event videos , these external videos contain simple contents such as objects , scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events",Mechanism,msa_2067936711
"Specifically , building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event , we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos",Mechanism,msa_2067936711
Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset,Method,msa_2067936711
"Traditional power system state estimation methods lack the ability to track and manage increasing uncertainties inherent in the new technologies , such as recent and ongoing massive penetration of renewable energy , distribution intelligence , and plug-in electric vehicles",Background,msa_2068046847
"To deal with the inability , a recent work proposes to utilize the unused historical data for power system state estimation",Background,msa_2068046847
"Although able to achieve much higher accuracy , the new approach is slow due to the burden by sequential similarity check over large volumes of high dimensional historical measurements , making it unsuitable for online services",Purpose,msa_2068046847
This calls for a general approach to preprocess the historical data,Purpose,msa_2068046847
"In this paper , we propose to achieve such a goal with three steps",Purpose,msa_2068046847
"First , because the power systems are with periodic patterns , which create clustered measurement data ,",Background,msa_2068046847
dimension reduction is proposed,Mechanism,msa_2068046847
to remove redundancy,Purpose,msa_2068046847
", but still able to retrieve similar measurements",Mechanism,msa_2068046847
"To further reduce the computational time ,",Purpose,msa_2068046847
the k-dimensional tree indexing approach is employed in step two,Mechanism,msa_2068046847
"to group the clustered power system data into a tree structure ,",Purpose,msa_2068046847
resulting in a log-reduction over searching time,Mechanism,msa_2068046847
"Finally , we verify the obtained historical power system states via AC power system model and the current measurements to filter out bad historical data",Method,msa_2068046847

The Internet of Things ( IoT ) aims to integrate the digital world of the Internet with our encompassing physical world,Background,msa_2068991234
"However , existing IoT lacks to provide considerate services , meaning that sensors dynamically `` collaborate '' to provide context-aware federated sensor data",Purpose,msa_2068991234
This paper reports our on-going work developing a sensor service federation and provisioning infrastructure,Mechanism,msa_2068991234
A novel approach has been presented to build social sensor networks,Mechanism,msa_2068991234
to record and study historical interaction patterns among sensors,Purpose,msa_2068991234
A case study is reported,Method,msa_2068991234
to leverage in-memory database to monitor and manage real-time sensor service provisioning,Purpose,msa_2068991234
A two-way publish/subscribe pattern on top of a message bus is established,Mechanism,msa_2068991234
to assure scalability of sensor service communication,Purpose,msa_2068991234
Workflow provenance is carried by a dynamic virtual device concept that we have introduced,Mechanism,msa_2068991234
A case study is reported,Method,msa_2068991234
A key idea in object-oriented programming is that objects encapsulate state and interact with each other by message exchange,Background,msa_2069380956
This perspective suggests a model of computation that is inherently concurrent ( to facilitate simultaneous message exchange ) and that accounts for the effect of message exchange on an object 's state ( to express valid sequences of state transitions ),Background,msa_2069380956
In this paper we show that such a model of computation arises naturally from session-based communication,Purpose,msa_2069380956
We introduce an object-oriented programming language that has processes as its only objects and employs linear session types,Mechanism,msa_2069380956
to express the protocols of message exchange and to reason about concurrency and state,Purpose,msa_2069380956
Based on various examples,Method,msa_2069380956
we show that our language supports the typical patterns of object-oriented programming ( e,Findings,msa_2069380956
", encapsulation , dynamic dispatch , and subtyping ) while guaranteeing session fidelity in a concurrent setting",Findings,msa_2069380956
"In addition , we show that our language facilitates new forms of expression ( e",Findings,msa_2069380956
", type-directed reuse , internal choice ) , which are not available in current object-oriented languages",Findings,msa_2069380956
"The Pascaline was the first working mechanical calculator , created in 1642 by the French polymath Blaise Pascal",Background,msa_2069415035
"Over the next two decades Pascal built 40 of these machines , of which nine survive today",Background,msa_2069415035
"Several good web resources describe the Pascaline , but to properly appreciate the sautoir , Pascal 's kinetic energy solution to jam-free ripple carry , building a working replica is invaluable",Background,msa_2069415035
"Thanks to the growing availability of rapid prototyping tools , it has become relatively easy for CS educators to fabricate physical artifacts to help students explore computational ideas",Purpose,msa_2069415035
"I 've created a Pascaline kit using laser-cut acrylic and standard fasteners that can be assembled with just a screwdriver , pliers , and Loctite",Mechanism,msa_2069415035
High school or college students with minimal skills can put it together in a few hours and have a functioning calculator,Mechanism,msa_2069415035
Exploring the Pascaline 's design is an engaging way to connect a milestone in the early history of computing with more modern theoretical concepts,Mechanism,msa_2069415035
Students can investigate questions such as : What makes a device `` digital '' ? ( Slide rules have numeric scales but are analog devices,Mechanism,msa_2069415035
) How does nonlinearity produce discrete states in a continuous world ? How are nonlinearities induced in the Pascaline vs,Mechanism,msa_2069415035
"in digital electronics ? How do the logic design concepts `` half adder '' and `` full adder '' map onto the components of the Pascaline ? Is the Pascaline really adding , or merely counting ? How does the Pascaline use nines complement arithmetic to perform subtraction , and why is n't it tens complement ?",Mechanism,msa_2069415035
User review is a crucial component of open mobile app markets such as the Google Play Store,Background,msa_2069442545
How do we automatically summarize millions of user reviews and make sense out of them ?,Background,msa_2069442545
"Unfortunately , beyond simple summaries such as histograms of user ratings , there are few analytic tools that can provide insights into user reviews",Purpose,msa_2069442545
"In this paper , we propose Wiscom , a system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail",Mechanism,msa_2069442545
"Our system is able to ( a ) discover inconsistencies in reviews ; ( b ) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app , and provide an interactive , zoomable view of how users ' reviews evolve over time ; and ( c ) provide valuable insights into the entire app market , identifying users ' major concerns and preferences of different types of apps",Mechanism,msa_2069442545
Results using our techniques are reported,Findings,msa_2069442545
"on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store",Method,msa_2069442545
"In an effort to address persistent consumer privacy concerns , policy makers and the data industry seem to have found common grounds in proposals that aim at making online privacy more `` transparent",Background,msa_2069636936
"'' Such self-regulatory approaches rely on , among other things , providing more and better information to users of Internet services about how their data is used",Background,msa_2069636936
"However , we illustrate",Purpose,msa_2069636936
in a series of experiments,Method,msa_2069636936
"that even simple privacy notices do not consistently impact disclosure behavior , and may in fact be used to nudge individuals to disclose variable amounts of personal information",Purpose,msa_2069636936
"In a first experiment ,",Method,msa_2069636936
"we demonstrate that the impact of privacy notices on disclosure is sensitive to relative judgments , even when the objective risks of disclosure actually stay constant",Findings,msa_2069636936
"In a second experiment ,",Method,msa_2069636936
we show that the impact of privacy notices on disclosure can be muted by introducing simple misdirections that do not alter the objective risk of disclosure,Findings,msa_2069636936
The commoditization of wireless sensing systems makes it feasible to include BAS functionality in small and medium-sized buildings,Background,msa_2069697254
The configuration complexity and cost of installation is now the dominant barrier to adoption,Purpose,msa_2069697254
In this demo we introduce a platform called Mortar,Mechanism,msa_2069697254
"io , which",Mechanism,msa_2069697254
"focuses on ease-of-installation , secure configuration , and management of BAS sub-systems in a manner that can scale from small to large installations",Purpose,msa_2069697254
Visually impaired people can struggle to use everyday appliances with inaccessible control panels,Purpose,msa_2070425136
"To address this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2070425136
we present ApplianceReader - a system that combines a wearable point-of-view camera with on-demand crowdsourcing and computer vision,Mechanism,msa_2070425136
to make appliance interfaces accessible,Purpose,msa_2070425136
"ApplianceReader sends photos of appliance interfaces that it has not seen previously to the crowd , who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface",Mechanism,msa_2070425136
Computer vision techniques then track the user 's finger pointing at the controls and read out the labels previously provided by the crowd,Mechanism,msa_2070425136
This enables visually impaired users to interactively explore and use appliances without asking the crowd repetitively,Mechanism,msa_2070425136
"Advances in real-time , embedded and distributed systems along with control and communication theory have catalyzed the rapid emergence of cyber-physical systems such as a self-driving car",Background,msa_2070961933
"The importance of fault-tolerance support on a cyber-physical system ( CPS ) has been greatly emphasized by recent research due to the nature of CPS that senses its surroundings , processes sensor data , and reacts using its actuators",Background,msa_2070961933
"In order to tackle this challenge , we proposed SAFER ( System-level Architecture for Failure Evasion in Real-time Applications ) in our previous work",Background,msa_2070961933
SAFER is able to tolerate fail-stop processor and/or task failures for distributed embedded real-time systems,Background,msa_2070961933
"One of its limitations , however , is that SAFER is not capable of tolerating a failure of a processor with a dedicated connection to an actuator",Purpose,msa_2070961933
This paper provides a method,Mechanism,msa_2070961933
that relaxes this limitation,Purpose,msa_2070961933
"by ( 1 ) deploying a small piece of hardware to avoid a dedicated connection between a processor and an actuator , ( 2 ) adding a software module that monitors and controls the hardware , and ( 3 ) enhancing the failure detection and recovery mechanisms of SAFER to support these changes",Mechanism,msa_2070961933
Behavioral coding is a common technique in the social sciences and human computer interaction for extracting meaning from video data [ 3 ],Background,msa_2071400413
"Since computer vision can not yet reliably interpret human actions and emotions , video coding remains a time-consuming manual process done by a small team of researchers",Purpose,msa_2071400413
"We present Glance , a tool",Mechanism,msa_2071400413
that allows researchers to rapidly analyze video datasets for behavioral events that are difficult to detect automatically,Purpose,msa_2071400413
"Glance uses the crowd to interpret natural language queries , and then aggregates and summarizes the content of the video",Mechanism,msa_2071400413
We show that Glance can accurately code events in video in a fraction of the time it would take a single person,Findings,msa_2071400413
"We also investigate speed improvements made possible by recruiting large crowds ,",Method,msa_2071400413
showing that Glance is able to code 80 % of an hour-long video in just 5 minutes,Findings,msa_2071400413
"We present the design , implementation , and verification of XMHF- an eXtensible and Modular Hypervisor Framework",Mechanism,msa_2073294836
XMHF is designed,Mechanism,msa_2073294836
"to achieve three goals -- modular extensibility , automated verification , and high performance",Purpose,msa_2073294836
XMHF includes a core that provides functionality common to many hypervisor-based security architectures and supports extensions that augment the core with additional security or functional properties while preserving the fundamental hypervisor security property of memory integrity ( i,Mechanism,msa_2073294836
", ensuring that the hypervisor 's memory is not modified by software running at a lower privilege level )",Mechanism,msa_2073294836
We verify the memory integrity of the XMHF core -- 6018 lines of code -- using a combination of automated and manual techniques,Method,msa_2073294836
The model checker CBMC automatically verifies 5208 lines of C code in about 80 seconds using less than 2GB of RAM,Findings,msa_2073294836
We manually audit the remaining 422 lines of C code and 388 lines of assembly language code that are stable and unlikely to change as development proceeds,Method,msa_2073294836
Our experiments,Method,msa_2073294836
"The promise of `` smart '' homes , workplaces , schools , and other environments has long been championed",Background,msa_2073408573
"Unattractive , however , has been the cost to run wires and install sensors",Background,msa_2073408573
"More critically , raw sensor data tends not to align with the types of questions humans wish to ask , e",Background,msa_2073408573
", do I need to restock my pantry ?",Background,msa_2073408573
"Although techniques like computer vision can answer some of these questions , it requires significant effort to build and train appropriate classifiers",Purpose,msa_2073408573
"Even then , these systems are often brittle , with limited ability to handle new or unexpected situations , including being repositioned and environmental changes ( e",Purpose,msa_2073408573
", lighting , furniture , seasons )",Purpose,msa_2073408573
"We propose Zensors , a new sensing approach that fuses real-time human intelligence from online crowd workers with automatic approaches",Mechanism,msa_2073408573
"to provide robust , adaptive , and readily deployable intelligent sensors",Purpose,msa_2073408573
"With Zensors , users can go from question to live sensor feed in less than 60 seconds",Mechanism,msa_2073408573
Video analysis has been attracting increasing research due to the proliferation of internet videos,Background,msa_2073807451
"In this paper , we investigate how to improve the performance on internet quality video analysis",Purpose,msa_2073807451
"Particularly , we work on the scenario of few labeled training videos being provided , which is less focused in multimedia",Purpose,msa_2073807451
"To being with , we consider how to more effectively harness the evidences from the low-level features",Purpose,msa_2073807451
Researchers have developed several promising features to represent videos to capture the semantic information,Purpose,msa_2073807451
"However , as videos usually characterize rich semantic contents , the analysis performance by using one single feature is potentially limited",Purpose,msa_2073807451
Simply combining multiple features through early fusion or late fusion to incorporate more informative cues is doable but not optimal due to the heterogeneity and different predicting capability of these features,Purpose,msa_2073807451
"For better exploitation of multiple features , we propose to mine the importance of different features and cast it into the learning of the classification model",Mechanism,msa_2073807451
Our method is based on multiple graphs from different features and uses the Riemannian metric to evaluate the feature importance,Mechanism,msa_2073807451
"On the other hand , to be able to use limited labeled training videos for a respectable accuracy we formulate our method in a semi-supervised way",Mechanism,msa_2073807451
The main contribution of this paper is a novel scheme of evaluating the feature importance that is further casted into a unified framework of harnessing multiple weighted features with limited labeled training videos,Mechanism,msa_2073807451
We perform extensive experiments on video action recognition and multimedia event recognition,Method,msa_2073807451
Distributed reinforcement learning algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2073900753
for collaborative multi-agent Markov decision processes ( MDPs ) are presented and analyzed,Purpose,msa_2073900753
The networked setup consists of a collection of agents ( learners ) which respond differently ( depending on their instantaneous one-stage random costs ) to a global controlled state and the control actions of a remote controller,Mechanism,msa_2073900753
"With the objective of jointly learning the optimal stationary control policy ( in the absence of global state transition and local agent cost statistics ) that minimizes network-averaged infinite horizon discounted cost ,",Purpose,msa_2073900753
the paper presents distributed variants of Q-learning of the consensus + innovations type in which each agent sequentially refines its learning parameters by locally processing its instantaneous payoff data and the information received from neighboring agents,Mechanism,msa_2073900753
"Under broad conditions on the multi-agent decision model and mean connectivity of the inter-agent communication network ,",Method,msa_2073900753

"With the advancement of information systems , means of communications are becoming cheaper , faster , and more available",Background,msa_2074522330
"Today , millions of people carrying smartphones or tablets are able to communicate practically any time and anywhere they want",Background,msa_2074522330
"They can access their e-mails , comment on weblogs , watch and post videos and photos ( as well as comment on them ) , and make phone calls or text messages almost ubiquitously",Background,msa_2074522330
"Given this scenario , in this article , we tackle a fundamental aspect of this new era of communication : How the time intervals between communication events behave for different technologies and means of communications",Purpose,msa_2074522330
"Are there universal patterns for the Inter-Event Time Distribution ( IED ) q How do inter-event times behave differently among particular technologiesq To answer these questions ,",Purpose,msa_2074522330
we analyzed eight different datasets from real and modern communication data and found four well-defined patterns seen in all the eight datasets,Method,msa_2074522330
"Moreover , we propose the use of the Self-Feeding Process ( SFP )",Mechanism,msa_2074522330

The SFP is an extremely parsimonious point process that requires at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the universal properties we observed in the data,Mechanism,msa_2074522330

"Multimedia Event Detection ( MED ) is a multimedia retrieval task with the goal of finding videos of a particular event in video archives , given example videos and event descriptions ; different from MED , multimedia classification is a task that classifies given videos into specified classes",Background,msa_2077395415
"Both tasks require mining features of example videos to learn the most discriminative features , with best performance resulting from a combination of multiple complementary features",Purpose,msa_2077395415
How to combine different features is the focus of this paper,Purpose,msa_2077395415
"Generally , early fusion and late fusion are two popular combination strategies",Background,msa_2077395415
The former one fuses features before performing classification and the latter one combines output of classifiers from different features,Background,msa_2077395415
Early fusion can better capture the relationship among features yet is prone to over-fit the training data,Background,msa_2077395415
Late fusion deals with the over-fitting problem better but does not allow classifiers to train on all the data at the same time,Background,msa_2077395415
"In this paper , we introduce a fusion scheme named double fusion , which simply combines early fusion and late fusion together to incorporate their advantages",Mechanism,msa_2077395415
Results are reported,Findings,msa_2077395415
"on the TRECVID MED 2010 , MED 2011 , UCF50 and HMDB51 datasets",Method,msa_2077395415
"Given a large collection of co-evolving multiple time-series , which contains an unknown number of patterns of different durations , how can we efficiently and effectively find typical patterns and the points of variation ? How can we statistically summarize all the sequences , and achieve a meaningful segmentation ?",Purpose,msa_2077760583
"In this paper we present AutoPlait , a fully automatic mining algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2077760583
for co-evolving time sequences,Purpose,msa_2077760583
"Our method has the following properties : ( a ) effectiveness : it operates on large collections of time-series , and finds similar segment groups that agree with human intuition ; ( b ) scalability : it is linear with the input size , and thus scales up very well ; and ( c ) AutoPlait is parameter-free , and requires no user intervention , no prior training , and no parameter tuning",Mechanism,msa_2077760583
Extensive experiments on 67GB of real datasets,Method,msa_2077760583
"In this paper we focus on common data reorganization operations such as shuffle , pack/unpack , swap , transpose , and layout transformations",Purpose,msa_2078141470
"Although these operations simply relocate the data in the memory , they are costly on conventional systems mainly due to inefficient access patterns , limited data reuse and roundtrip data traversal throughout the memory hierarchy",Purpose,msa_2078141470
This paper presents a two pronged approach,Mechanism,msa_2078141470
for efficient data reorganization,Purpose,msa_2078141470
", which combines ( i ) a proposed DRAM-aware reshape accelerator integrated within 3D-stacked DRAM , and ( ii ) a mathematical framework that is used to represent and optimize the reorganization operations",Mechanism,msa_2078141470
We evaluate our proposed system through two major use cases,Method,msa_2078141470
"First , we demonstrate the reshape accelerator in performing a physical address remapping via data layout transform to utilize the internal parallelism/locality of the 3D-stacked DRAM structure more efficiently for general purpose workloads",Method,msa_2078141470
"Then , we focus on offloading and accelerating commonly used data reorganization routines selected from the Intel Math Kernel Library package",Method,msa_2078141470
We evaluate the energy and performance benefits of our approach by comparing it against existing optimized implementations on state-of-the-art GPUs and CPUs,Method,msa_2078141470
"Can we identify patterns of temporal activities caused by human communications in social media ? Is it possible to model these patterns and tell if a user is a human or a bot based only on the timing of their postings ? Social media services allow users to make postings , generating large datasets of human activity time-stamps",Background,msa_2078701302
In this paper we analyze time-stamp data from social media services,Purpose,msa_2078701302
"and find that the distribution of postings inter-arrival times ( IAT ) is characterized by four patterns : ( i ) positive correlation between consecutive IATs , ( ii ) heavy tails , ( iii ) periodic spikes and ( iv ) bimodal distribution",Findings,msa_2078701302
"Based on our findings , we propose Rest-Sleep-and-Comment ( RSC ) , a generative model",Mechanism,msa_2078701302
that is able to match all four discovered patterns,Purpose,msa_2078701302
We demonstrate the utility of RSC,Method,msa_2078701302
by showing that it can accurately fit real time-stamp data from Reddit and Twitter,Findings,msa_2078701302
"We also show that RSC can be used to spot outliers and detect users with non-human behavior , such as bots",Findings,msa_2078701302
We validate RSC using real data consisting of over 35 million postings from Twitter and Reddit,Method,msa_2078701302
Detecting and quantifying the timing and the genetic contributions of parental populations to a hybrid population is an important but challenging problem in reconstructing evolutionary histories from genetic variation data,Background,msa_2078871685
"With the advent of high throughput genotyping technologies , new methods suitable for large-scale data are especially needed",Background,msa_2078871685
"Furthermore , existing methods typically assume the assignment of individuals into subpopulations is known , when that itself is a difficult problem often unresolved for real data",Purpose,msa_2078871685
"Here , we propose a novel method that combines prior work for inferring nonreticulate population structures with an MCMC scheme for sampling over admixture scenarios",Mechanism,msa_2078871685
to both identify population assignments and learn divergence times and admixture proportions for those populations,Purpose,msa_2078871685
using genome-scale admixed genetic variation data,Mechanism,msa_2078871685
We validated our method using coalescent simulations and a collection of real bovine and human variation data,Method,msa_2078871685
The paper studies the problem of distributed parameter estimation,Purpose,msa_2079252010
in multi-agent networks with exponential family observation statistics,Mechanism,msa_2079252010
"A certainty-equivalence type distributed estimator of the consensus + innovations form is proposed in which , at each each observation sampling epoch agents update their local parameter estimates by appropriately combining the data received from their neighbors and the locally sensed new information ( innovation )",Mechanism,msa_2079252010
"Under global observability of the networked sensing model , i",Mechanism,msa_2079252010
", the ability to distinguish between different instances of the parameter value based on the joint observation statistics , and mean connectivity of the inter-agent communication network , the proposed estimator",Mechanism,msa_2079252010
is shown to yield consistent parameter estimates at each network agent,Findings,msa_2079252010
"Further , it is shown that the distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient , in that , the asymptotic covariances of the agent estimates coincide with that of the optimal centralized estimator , i",Findings,msa_2079252010
", the inverse of the centralized Fisher information rate",Findings,msa_2079252010
"Reasoning that overexpression of multiple E2F-responsive genes might be a useful marker for RB1 dysfunction ,",Purpose,msa_2079298178
"we compiled a list of E2F-responsive genes from the literature and evaluated their expression in publicly available gene expression microarray data of patients with breast cancer , serous ovarian cancer , and prostate cancer",Method,msa_2079298178
"In breast cancer , a group of tumors was identified , each of which simultaneously overexpressed multiple E2F-responsive genes",Findings,msa_2079298178
"Seventy percent of these genes were concerned with cell cycle progression , DNA repair , or mitosis",Findings,msa_2079298178
"These E2F-responsive gene overexpressing ( ERGO ) tumors frequently exhibited additional evidence of Rb/E2F axis dysfunction , were mostly triple negative , and preferentially overexpressed multiple basal cytokeratins , suggesting that they overlapped substantially with the basal-like tumor subset",Findings,msa_2079298178
ERGO tumors were also identified in serous ovarian cancer and prostate cancer,Findings,msa_2079298178
"In these cancer types , there was no evidence for a tumor subset comparable to the breast cancer basal-like subset",Findings,msa_2079298178
A core group of about 30 E2F-responsive genes were overexpressed in all three cancer types,Findings,msa_2079298178
We explore 3D printing physical controls whose tactile response can be manipulated programmatically through pneumatic actuation,Purpose,msa_2079316448
"In particular , by manipulating the internal air pressure of various pneumatic elements , we can create mechanisms that require different levels of actuation force and can also change their shape",Mechanism,msa_2079316448
We introduce and discuss a series of example 3D printed pneumatic controls,Method,msa_2079316448
", which demonstrate the feasibility of our approach",Findings,msa_2079316448
"This includes conventional controls , such as buttons , knobs and sliders , but also extends to domains such as toys and deformable interfaces",Method,msa_2079316448
We describe the challenges that we faced and the methods that we used to overcome some of the limitations of current 3D printing technology,Mechanism,msa_2079316448
"Many people would find the Web easier to use if content was a little bigger , even those who already find the Web possible to use now",Background,msa_2079605657
This paper introduces the idea of opportunistic accessibility improvement in which,Mechanism,msa_2079605657
"improvements intended to make a web page easier to access , such as magnification , are automatically applied to the extent that they can be without causing negative side effects",Purpose,msa_2079605657
We explore this idea with oppaccess,Mechanism,msa_2079605657
"js , an easily-deployed system for magnifying web pages that iteratively increases magnification until it notices negative side effects , such as horizontal scrolling or overlapping text",Mechanism,msa_2079605657
We validate this approach,Method,msa_2079605657
by magnifying existing web pages 1,Findings,msa_2079605657
6x on average without introducing negative side effects,Findings,msa_2079605657
"We consider the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods , focusing on a recently-introduced notion of fairness called maximin share guarantee : Each player 's value for his allocation should be at least as high as what he can guarantee by dividing the items into as many bundles as there are players and receiving his least desirable bundle",Purpose,msa_2079854492
Assuming additive valuation functions,Method,msa_2079854492
", we show that such allocations may not exist , but allocations guaranteeing each player 2/3 of the above value always exist ,",Findings,msa_2079854492
and can be computed in polynomial time when the number of players is constant,Mechanism,msa_2079854492

to improve accuracy in differentially private data analysis,Purpose,msa_2080900058
"The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global sensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets , we take advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have , to quantify over a restricted class of datasets",Mechanism,msa_2080900058
"Specifically , given a query f and a hypothesis HH about the structure of a dataset D , we show generically how to transform f into a new query f HH whose global sensitivity ( over all datasets including those that do not satisfy HH ) matches the restricted sensitivity of the query f",Mechanism,msa_2080900058
"Moreover , if the belief of the querier is correct ( i",Mechanism,msa_2080900058
", D HH ) then f HH ( D ) 0 f ( D )",Mechanism,msa_2080900058
"If the belief is incorrect , then f HH ( D ) may be inaccurate",Mechanism,msa_2080900058
"We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of answering queries regarding social-networks ,",Method,msa_2080900058
which we model as a combination of a graph and a labeling of its vertices,Mechanism,msa_2080900058
"In particular , while our generic procedure is computationally inefficient , for the specific definition of H as graphs of bounded degree , we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f H using different projection-based techniques",Findings,msa_2080900058
We then analyze two important query classes : subgraph counting queries ( e,Method,msa_2080900058
", number of triangles ) and local profile queries ( e",Method,msa_2080900058
", number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist who know each other )",Method,msa_2080900058
"Activity recognition can provide computers with the context underlying user inputs , enabling more relevant responses and more fluid interaction",Background,msa_2080951892
"However , training these systems is difficult because it requires observing every possible sequence of actions that comprise a given activity",Purpose,msa_2080951892
"Prior work has enabled the crowd to provide labels in real-time to train automated systems on-the-fly , but numerous examples are still needed before the system can recognize an activity on its own",Background,msa_2080951892
"To reduce the need to collect this data by observing users ,",Purpose,msa_2080951892
"we introduce ARchitect , a system that uses the crowd to capture the dependency structure of the actions that make up activities",Mechanism,msa_2080951892
Our tests,Method,msa_2080951892
Multimedia event detection ( MED ) plays an important role in many applications such as video indexing and retrieval,Background,msa_2081899160
Current event detection works mainly focus on sports and news event detection or abnormality detection in surveillance videos,Purpose,msa_2081899160
"Differently , our research aims to detect more complicated and generic events within a longer video sequence",Purpose,msa_2081899160
"In the past , researchers have proposed using intermediate concept classifiers with concept lexica to help understand the videos",Purpose,msa_2081899160
Yet it is difficult to judge how many and what concepts would be sufficient for the particular video analysis task,Purpose,msa_2081899160
"Additionally , obtaining robust semantic concept classifiers requires a large number of positive training examples , which in turn has high human annotation cost",Purpose,msa_2081899160
"In this paper , we propose an approach that exploits the external concepts-based videos and event-based videos simultaneously to learn an intermediate representation from video features",Mechanism,msa_2081899160
Our algorithm integrates the classifier inference and latent intermediate representation into a joint framework,Mechanism,msa_2081899160
The joint optimization of the intermediate representation and the classifier makes them mutually beneficial and reciprocal,Mechanism,msa_2081899160
"Effectively , the intermediate representation and the classifier are tightly correlated",Mechanism,msa_2081899160
The classifier dependent intermediate representation not only accurately reflects the task semantics but is also more suitable for the specific classifier,Mechanism,msa_2081899160
Thus we have created a discriminative semantic analysis framework based on a tightly coupled intermediate representation,Mechanism,msa_2081899160
Extensive experiments on multimedia event detection using real-world videos,Method,msa_2081899160
Ultrasonic guided-waves propagating in pipes with varying environmental and operational conditions ( EOCs ) are usually the results of complex superposition of multiple modes travelling in multiple paths,Background,msa_2082178729
"Among all of the components forming a complex guided-wave signal , the arrivals scattered by damage ( so called scatter signal ) are of importance for damage diagnosis purposes",Background,msa_2082178729
This paper evaluates the potentials of nonlinear decomposition methods for extracting the scatter signal from a multi-modal signal recorded from a pipe under varying temperatures,Purpose,msa_2082178729
"Current approaches for extracting scatter signal can be categorized as ( A ) baseline subtraction methods , and ( B ) linear decomposition methods",Background,msa_2082178729
"In this paper , we first illustrate , experimentally , the challenges for applying these methods on multi-modal signals at varying temperatures",Purpose,msa_2082178729
"To better analyze the experimental results , the effects of temperature on multi-modal signals are simulated",Method,msa_2082178729
The simulation results show that different wave modes may have significantly different sensitivities to temperature variations,Findings,msa_2082178729
"This brings about challenges such as shape distortion and nonlinear relations between the signals recorded at different temperatures , which prevent the aforementioned methods to be extensible to wide range of temperatures",Findings,msa_2082178729
"In this paper ,",Purpose,msa_2082178729
"we examine the potential of a nonlinear decomposition method , namely nonlinear principal component analysis ( NLPCA ) ,",Mechanism,msa_2082178729
"for removing the nonlinear relation between the components of a multi-modal guided-wave signal , and thus , extracting the scatter signal",Purpose,msa_2082178729
Ultrasonic pitch-catch measurements from an aluminum pipe segment in a thermally controlled laboratory are used to evaluate the detection performance of the damage-sensitive features extracted by the proposed approach,Method,msa_2082178729
"Abstract In case of an emergency in a building , first responders need to know current blockages in the building ( e",Background,msa_2083376899
", blocked passageways and exits ) and safe evacuating paths so that the occupants can be guided to the unblocked exits and safe paths toward those exits",Background,msa_2083376899
"To automatically determine blockage levels at buildings ,",Purpose,msa_2083376899
a system that fuses data from multiple sensors and video camera was proposed,Mechanism,msa_2083376899
A prototype was developed,Mechanism,msa_2083376899
and tested on an experimental model of a pilot building 's hallway,Method,msa_2083376899
A series of damage tests were conducted on the hallway model and recorded by the sensors and the video camera,Method,msa_2083376899
"Individual performances of sensors and video camera were evaluated ,",Method,msa_2083376899
and a decision tree method was used,Mechanism,msa_2083376899
to fuse sensor and video camera data for estimating the level of blockage in the hallway for different damage combinations applied on building components,Purpose,msa_2083376899
"The results demonstrated the technical feasibility of the proposed system and the findings of the decision tree highlight that by using less number of sensors , a cost-effective configuration can be achieved",Findings,msa_2083376899
Topic models are effective probabilistic tools for processing large collections of unstructured data,Background,msa_2083511819
"With the exponential growth of modern industrial data , and consequentially also with our ambition to explore much bigger models , there is a real pressing need to significantly scale up topic modeling algorithms , which has been taken up in lots of previous works , culminating in the recent fast Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms in [ 10 , 23 ] for the unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) formulations",Purpose,msa_2083511819
In this work we extend the recent sampling advances for unsupervised LDA models to supervised tasks,Purpose,msa_2083511819
We focus on the Gibbs MedLDA model [ 27 ] that is able to simultaneously discover latent structures and make accurate predictions,Mechanism,msa_2083511819
By combining a set of sampling techniques we are able to reduce the O ( K 3 + DK 2 + DNK complexity in [ 27 ] to O ( DK + DN ) when there are K topics and D documents with average length N,Mechanism,msa_2083511819
"To our best knowledge , this is the first linear time sampling algorithm for supervised topic models",Mechanism,msa_2083511819
"Our algorithm requires minimal modifications to incorporate most loss functions in a variety of supervised tasks , and we observe in our experiments an order of magnitude speedup over the current state-of-the-art implementation , while achieving similar prediction performances",Mechanism,msa_2083511819
We derive the time reversal likelihood ratio optimal detector,Mechanism,msa_2083979825
for,Background,msa_2083979825
a target in stationary random multipath clutter,Purpose,msa_2083979825
", extending prior work where both are assumed to be deterministic",Background,msa_2083979825
We suppress the stationary clutter through adaptive power allocation,Mechanism,msa_2083979825
We show that the Time Reversal Likelihood Ratio Test performs much better than the conventional Weighted Energy Detector,Findings,msa_2083979825
We provide analytical,Method,msa_2083979825
results,Findings,msa_2083979825
"on the performance of the time reversal detector by approximating it with the Time Reversal Linear Quadratic detector , which models the received signal as a Complex Gaussian",Method,msa_2083979825

"Text can often be complex and difficult to read , especially for people with cognitive impairments or low literacy skills",Background,msa_2084251146
"Text simplification is a process that reduces the complexity of both wording and structure in a sentence , while retaining its meaning",Background,msa_2084251146
"However , this is currently a challenging task for machines , and thus , providing effective on-demand text simplification to those who need it remains an unsolved problem",Purpose,msa_2084251146
"Even evaluating the simplicity of text remains a challenging problem for both computers , which can not understand the meaning of text , and humans , who often struggle to agree on what constitutes a good simplification",Purpose,msa_2084251146
This paper focuses on the evaluation of English text simplification using the crowd,Method,msa_2084251146
We show that leveraging crowds can result in a collective decision that is accurate and converges to a consensus rating,Findings,msa_2084251146
"Our results from 2,500 crowd annotations",Method,msa_2084251146
show that the crowd can effectively rate levels of simplicity,Findings,msa_2084251146
Seeking solutions from one domain to solve problems in another is an effective process of innovation,Background,msa_2084291440
This process of analogy searching is difficult for both humans and machines,Purpose,msa_2084291440
"In this paper , we present a novel approach",Mechanism,msa_2084291440
"for re-presenting a problem in terms of its abstract structure , and then allowing people to use this structural representation to find analogies",Purpose,msa_2084291440
We propose a crowdsourcing process that helps people navigate a large dataset to find analogies,Mechanism,msa_2084291440
"Through two experiments ,",Method,msa_2084291440
"we show the benefits of using abstract structural representations to search for ideas that are analogous to a source problem , and that these analogies result in better solutions than alternative approaches",Findings,msa_2084291440

"In 1876 , Charles Lutwidge Dodgson suggested the intriguing voting rule that today bears his name",Background,msa_2084807538
"Although Dodgsons rule is one of the most well-studied voting rules , it suffers from serious deficiencies , both from the computational point of viewit is NP-hard even to approximate the Dodgson score within sublogarithmic factorsand from the social choice point of viewit fails basic social choice desiderata such as monotonicity and homogeneity",Background,msa_2084807538
"However , this does not preclude the existence of approximation algorithms for Dodgson that are monotonic or homogeneous , and indeed it is natural to ask whether such algorithms exist",Purpose,msa_2084807538
"In this article , we give definitive answers to these questions",Purpose,msa_2084807538
"We design a monotonic exponential-time algorithm that yields a 2-approximation to the Dodgson score , while matching this result with a tight lower bound",Mechanism,msa_2084807538
We also present a monotonic polynomial-time O ( log m ) -approximation algorithm ( where m is the number of alternatives ) ; this result is tight as well due to a complexity-theoretic lower bound,Mechanism,msa_2084807538
"Furthermore , we show that a slight variation on a known voting rule yields a monotonic , homogeneous , polynomial-time O ( m log m ) -approximation algorithm and establish that it is impossible to achieve a better approximation ratio even if one just asks for homogeneity",Findings,msa_2084807538
"We complete the picture by studying several additional social choice properties ; for these properties ,",Method,msa_2084807538
"Given a snapshot of a large graph , in which an infection has been spreading for some time , can we identify those nodes from which the infection started to spread ? In other words , can we reliably tell who the culprits are ? In this paper , we answer this question affirmatively",Purpose,msa_2085330768
and give an efficient method called NetSleuth for the well-known susceptible-infected virus propagation model,Mechanism,msa_2085330768
"Essentially , we are after that set of seed nodes that best explain the given snapshot",Purpose,msa_2085330768
We propose to employ the minimum description length principle,Mechanism,msa_2085330768
"to identify the best set of seed nodes and virus propagation ripple ,",Purpose,msa_2085330768
as the one by which we can most succinctly describe the infected graph,Mechanism,msa_2085330768
We give an highly efficient algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2085330768
to identify likely sets of seed nodes,Purpose,msa_2085330768
given a snapshot,Mechanism,msa_2085330768
"Then , given these seed nodes , we show we can optimize the virus propagation ripple in a principled way by maximizing likelihood",Mechanism,msa_2085330768
"With all three combined , NetSleuth can automatically identify the correct number of seed nodes , as well as which nodes are the culprits",Mechanism,msa_2085330768

"As sensor networks gain traction and begin to scale , we will be increasingly faced with challenges associated with managing large-scale time-series data",Purpose,msa_2086634749
"In this paper , we present a cloud-to-edge partitioned architecture called Respawn",Mechanism,msa_2086634749
that is capable of serving large amounts of time-series data from a continuously updating datastore with access latencies low enough to support interactive real-time visualization,Purpose,msa_2086634749
Respawn targets sensing systems where resource-constrained edge node devices may only have limited or intermittent network connections linking them to a cloud-backend,Mechanism,msa_2086634749
The cloud-backend provides aggregate storage and transparent dispatching of data queries to edge node devices,Mechanism,msa_2086634749
Data is downsampled as it enters the system creating a multi-resolution representation capable of lowlatency range-base queries,Mechanism,msa_2086634749
Lower-resolution aggregate data is automatically migrated from edge nodes to the cloud-backend both for improved consistency and caching,Mechanism,msa_2086634749
"In order to further mask latency from users , edge nodes automatically identify and migrate blocks of data that contain statistically interesting features",Mechanism,msa_2086634749
We show through simulation and micro-benchmarking,Method,msa_2086634749
"Online instructional videos have become a popular way for people to learn new skills encompassing art , cooking and sports",Background,msa_2087095333
"As watching instructional videos is a natural way for humans to learn , analogously , machines can also gain knowledge from these videos",Purpose,msa_2087095333
We propose to utilize the large amount of instructional videos available online,Mechanism,msa_2087095333
to harvest examples of various actions in an unsupervised fashion,Purpose,msa_2087095333
"The key observation is that in instructional videos , the instructor 's action is highly correlated with the instructor 's narration",Mechanism,msa_2087095333
"By leveraging this correlation , we can exploit the timing of action corresponding terms in the speech transcript to temporally localize actions in the video and harvest action examples",Mechanism,msa_2087095333
The proposed method is scalable as it requires no human intervention,Mechanism,msa_2087095333
Experiments,Method,msa_2087095333
We introduce GOTCHAs ( Generating panOptic Turing Tests to Tell Computers and Humans Apart ) as,Mechanism,msa_2087133238
a way of preventing automated offline dictionary attacks against user selected passwords,Purpose,msa_2087133238
"A GOTCHA is a randomized puzzle generation protocol , which involves interaction between a computer and a human",Mechanism,msa_2087133238
"Informally , a GOTCHA should satisfy two key properties : ( 1 ) The puzzles are easy for the human to solve",Mechanism,msa_2087133238
( 2 ) The puzzles are hard for a computer to solve even if it has the random bits used by the computer to generate the final puzzle -- - unlike a CAPTCHA [ 44 ],Mechanism,msa_2087133238
Our main theorem demonstrates that GOTCHAs can be used to mitigate the threat of offline dictionary attacks against passwords by ensuring that a password cracker must receive constant feedback from a human being while mounting an attack,Mechanism,msa_2087133238
"Finally , we provide a candidate construction of GOTCHAs based on Inkblot images",Mechanism,msa_2087133238
Our construction relies on the usability assumption that users can recognize the phrases that they originally used to describe each Inkblot image -- - a much weaker usability assumption than previous password systems based on Inkblots which required users to recall their phrase exactly,Mechanism,msa_2087133238
Viral videos that gain popularity through the process of Internet sharing are having a profound impact on society,Background,msa_2087398646
Existing studies on viral videos have only been on small or confidential datasets,Purpose,msa_2087398646
"We collect by far the largest open benchmark for viral video study called CMU Viral Video Dataset , and share it with researchers from both academia and industry",Method,msa_2087398646
"Having verified existing observations on the dataset ,",Method,msa_2087398646
we discover some interesting characteristics of viral videos,Findings,msa_2087398646
"Based on our analysis , in the second half of the paper , we propose a model",Mechanism,msa_2087398646
to forecast the future peak day of viral videos,Purpose,msa_2087398646
"The application of our work is not only important for advertising agencies to plan advertising campaigns and estimate costs , but also for companies to be able to quickly respond to rivals in viral marketing campaigns",Background,msa_2087398646
The proposed method is unique in that it is the first attempt to incorporate video metadata into the peak day prediction,Background,msa_2087398646
Space-Time Adaptive Processing ( STAP ) is a technique for processing signals from multiple antenna elements over multiple time periods for target detection,Background,msa_2087526979
"As STAP algorithms are typical run on airborne platforms , they need to be both high performance and energy-efficient",Background,msa_2087526979
"Due to the high rate of processing required , many existing algorithms focus on reducing the dimensionality of the data , or exploiting structure in the underlying mathematical formulation in order to reduce the total number of floating-point operations ( FLOPs ) , and consequently , the time for computation",Background,msa_2087526979
"While such algorithms target the FLOPs-intensive operations within the STAP algorithm , a significant portion of the compute time for most STAP algorithms is actually spent in low-FLOPs , memory-bounded operations",Purpose,msa_2087526979
"In this paper ,",Mechanism,msa_2087526979
we address the computation of these memory-bounded operations within the STAP algorithm,Purpose,msa_2087526979
using a 3D stacked Logic-in-Memory system,Mechanism,msa_2087526979
"The imminent arrival of 3D stacked memory makes avail high memory bandwidth , which opens up a new and orthogonal dimension for optimizing STAP algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2087526979
"For deeply scaled digital integrated systems , the power required for transporting data between memory and logic can exceed the power needed for computation , thereby limiting the efficacy of synthesizing logic and compiling memory independently",Background,msa_2088039427
Logic-in-Memory ( LiM ) architectures address this challenge by embedding logic within the memory block to perform basic operations on data locally for specific functions,Background,msa_2088039427
"While custom smart memories have been successfully constructed for various applications , a fully automated LiM synthesis flow enables architectural exploration that has heretofore not been possible",Purpose,msa_2088039427
In this paper we present a tool and design methodology for LiM physical synthesis,Mechanism,msa_2088039427
that performs co-design of algorithms and architectures to explore system level trade-offs,Purpose,msa_2088039427
The resulting layouts and timing models can be incorporated within any physical synthesis tool,Mechanism,msa_2088039427
Silicon,Method,msa_2088039427
We consider an adaptive cruise control system in which,Mechanism,msa_2088607916
control decisions are made,Purpose,msa_2088607916
based on position and velocity information received from other vehicles via V2V wireless communication,Mechanism,msa_2088607916
"If the vehicles follow each other at a close distance , they have better wireless reception but collisions may occur when a follower car does not receive notice about the decelerations of the leader car fast enough to react before it is too late",Mechanism,msa_2088607916
"If the vehicles are farther apart , they would have a bigger safety margin , but the wireless communication drops out more often , so that the follower car no longer receives what the leader car is doing",Mechanism,msa_2088607916
"In order to guarantee safety , such a system must return control to the driver if it does not receive an update from a nearby vehicle within some timeout period",Mechanism,msa_2088607916
The value of this timeout parameter encodes a tradeoff between the likelihood that an update is received and the maximum safe acceleration,Mechanism,msa_2088607916
"Combining formal verification techniques for hybrid systems with a wireless communication model ,",Mechanism,msa_2088607916
Accurate models of the cross-talk between signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks within cells are essential to understand complex response programs,Background,msa_2089691349
We present a new computational method that combines condition-specific time-series expression data with general protein interaction data,Mechanism,msa_2089691349
to reconstruct dynamic and causal stress response networks,Purpose,msa_2089691349
"These networks characterize the pathways involved in the response , their time of activation , and the affected genes",Mechanism,msa_2089691349
The signaling and regulatory components of our networks are linked via a set of common transcription factors that serve as targets in the signaling network and as regulators of the transcriptional response network,Mechanism,msa_2089691349
Detailed case studies of stress responses in budding yeast,Method,msa_2089691349
demonstrate the predictive power of our method,Findings,msa_2089691349
Our method correctly identifies the core signaling proteins and transcription factors of the response programs,Mechanism,msa_2089691349
It further predicts the involvement of additional transcription factors and other proteins not previously implicated in the response pathways,Mechanism,msa_2089691349
We experimentally verify several of these predictions for the osmotic stress response network,Method,msa_2089691349
"Our approach requires little condition-specific data : only a partial set of upstream initiators and time-series gene expression data , which are readily available for many conditions and species",Mechanism,msa_2089691349
"People spend an enormous amount of time searching for complex information online ; for example , consumers researching new purchases or patients learning about their conditions",Background,msa_2089703868
"As they search , people build up rich mental schemas about their target domains ; which , if effectively shared , could accelerate learning for others with similar interests",Purpose,msa_2089703868
In this paper we introduce a novel approach,Mechanism,msa_2089703868
for integrating the schemas individuals develop as they gather information online and surfacing them for others with similar interests,Purpose,msa_2089703868
Through a controlled experiment,Method,msa_2089703868
"Multimedia event detection ( MED ) is a retrieval task with the goal of finding videos of a particular event in a large scale internet video archive , given example videos and text descriptions",Background,msa_2090410387
"Nowadays , different multimodal fusion schemes of low-level and high-level features are extensively investigated and evaluated for MED",Purpose,msa_2090410387
"For most of events in MED , people are usually the central subjects in videos",Purpose,msa_2090410387
The face of a person can be considered as the most important factor which brings a lot of information describing the video events,Purpose,msa_2090410387
"However , face information has not been systematically investigated in the previous research for MED",Purpose,msa_2090410387
"In this paper , we investigate the possibility of using the high-level face information to assist multimedia event detection",Mechanism,msa_2090410387
"Moreover , since the labeled data in TRECVID MED dataset are limited , we propose a semi-supervised kernel ridge regression which works well in practice to explore the useful information from unlabeled data to assist the event detection",Mechanism,msa_2090410387
Extensive experimental results on TRECVID MED dataset,Method,msa_2090410387
Current research is interested in identifying how topology impacts epidemics in networks,Background,msa_2090509666
"In this paper , we model SIS ( susceptible-infected-susceptible ) epidemics as a continuous-time Markov process and for which",Mechanism,msa_2090509666
we can obtain a closed form description of the equilibrium distribution,Purpose,msa_2090509666
Such distribution describes the long-run behavior of the epidemics,Mechanism,msa_2090509666
The adjacency matrix of the network topology is reflected explicitly in the formulation of the equilibrium distribution,Mechanism,msa_2090509666
"Secondly , we are interested in analyzing the model in the regime where the topology dependent infection process opposes the topology independent healing process",Method,msa_2090509666
"Specifically , how will network topology affect the most probable long-run network state ?",Method,msa_2090509666
Provision of training data sets is one of the core requirements for event-based supervised NILM ( Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring ) algorithms,Background,msa_2090598788
"Due to diversity in appliances ' technologies , in-situ training by users is often required",Background,msa_2090598788
This process might require continuous user-interaction to ensure that a high quality training data set is provided,Background,msa_2090598788
Pre-populating a training data set could potentially reduce the need for user-system interaction,Purpose,msa_2090598788
"In this study , a heuristic unsupervised clustering algorithm is presented and evaluated",Mechanism,msa_2090598788
to enable autonomous partitioning of appliances signature space ( i,Purpose,msa_2090598788
e,Purpose,msa_2090598788
feature space ) for applications in electricity consumption disaggregation,Purpose,msa_2090598788
The algorithm is based on hierarchical clustering and uses the characteristics of a cluster binary tree to determine the distance threshold for pruning the tree without a priori information,Mechanism,msa_2090598788
The algorithm determines the partition of a feature space recursively to account for multi-scale nature of the binary cluster tree,Mechanism,msa_2090598788
Evaluation of the algorithm was carried out using metrics for accuracy and cluster quality ( proposed in this study ) on a fully labeled data set that was collected and processed in a real residential setting,Method,msa_2090598788
"Given a table where rows correspond to records and columns correspond to attributes , we want to find a small number of patterns that succinctly summarize the dataset",Purpose,msa_2091356303
"For example , given a set of patient records with several attributes each , how can we find ( a ) that the `` most representative '' pattern is , say , ( male , adult , * ) , followed by ( * , child , low-cholesterol ) , etc ?",Purpose,msa_2091356303
"We propose TSum , a method",Mechanism,msa_2091356303
that provides a sequence of patterns,Purpose,msa_2091356303
ordered by their `` representativeness,Mechanism,msa_2091356303
"'' It can decide both which these patterns are , as well as how many are necessary to properly summarize the data",Mechanism,msa_2091356303
"Our main contribution is formulating a general framework , TSum , using compression principles",Mechanism,msa_2091356303
TSum can easily accommodate different optimization strategies for selecting and refining patterns,Mechanism,msa_2091356303
"The discovered patterns can be used to both represent the data efficiently , as well as interpret it quickly",Mechanism,msa_2091356303
Extensive experiments,Method,msa_2091356303
Matched field processing is a powerful tool for accurately localizing targets in dispersive media,Background,msa_2092287656
"However , matched field processing requires a precise model of the medium under test",Background,msa_2092287656
"In underwater acoustics , where matched field processing has been extensively studied , authors often resort to extremely detailed numerical models of the propagation medium , which are computationally expensive and impractical for many applications",Background,msa_2092287656
"As an alternative , this paper uses convex sparse recovery techniques",Mechanism,msa_2092287656
"to construct ,",Purpose,msa_2092287656
"directly from measured data ,",Mechanism,msa_2092287656
an accurate model of a plate medium,Purpose,msa_2092287656
based on its dispersion characteristics,Mechanism,msa_2092287656
"From this data-driven model , the Green 's function between two points can be readily predicted",Mechanism,msa_2092287656
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model,Findings,msa_2092287656
by localizing a source in a dispersive plate medium,Method,msa_2092287656
Restricted Boltzmann Machine ( RBM ) has shown great effectiveness in document modeling,Background,msa_2092961325
"It utilizes hidden units to discover the latent topics and can learn compact semantic representations for documents which greatly facilitate document retrieval , clustering and classification",Background,msa_2092961325
The popularity ( or frequency ) of topics in text corpora usually follow a power-law distribution where a few dominant topics occur very frequently while most topics ( in the long-tail region ) have low probabilities,Purpose,msa_2092961325
"Due to this imbalance , RBM tends to learn multiple redundant hidden units to best represent dominant topics and ignore those in the long-tail region , which renders the learned representations to be redundant and non-informative",Purpose,msa_2092961325
"To solve this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2092961325
"we propose Diversified RBM ( DRBM ) which diversifies the hidden units , to make them cover not only the dominant topics , but also those in the long-tail region",Mechanism,msa_2092961325
We define a diversity metric and use it as a regularizer to encourage the hidden units to be diverse,Mechanism,msa_2092961325
"Since the diversity metric is hard to optimize directly , we instead optimize its lower bound and prove that maximizing the lower bound with projected gradient ascent can increase this diversity metric",Mechanism,msa_2092961325

Despite benefits and uses of social networking sites ( SNSs ) users are not always satisfied with their behaviors on the sites,Background,msa_2093680229
These desires for behavior change both provide insight into users ' perceptions of how SNSs impact their lives ( positively or negatively ) and can inform tools for helping users achieve desired behavior changes,Purpose,msa_2093680229
We use a 604-participant online survey,Method,msa_2093680229
"to explore SNS users ' behavior-change goals for Facebook , Instagram , and Twitter",Purpose,msa_2093680229
"While some participants want to reduce site use , others want to improve their use or increase a range of behaviors",Findings,msa_2093680229
"These desired changes differ by SNS , and , for Twitter , by participants ' levels of site use",Findings,msa_2093680229
"Participants also expect a range of benefits from these goals , including increased time , contact with others , intrinsic benefits , better security/privacy , and improved self presentation",Findings,msa_2093680229
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring ( NILM ) has been studied for a few decades now as a method of disaggregating information about appliance level power consumption in a building from aggregate measurements of voltage and/or current obtained at a centralized location in the electrical system,Background,msa_2093735991
"When such information is provided to the electricity consumer as feedback , they can then take the necessary steps to modify their behavior and conserve electricity",Background,msa_2093735991
Research has shown potential for savings of up to 20 % through this kind of feedback,Background,msa_2093735991
The training phase required to allow the algorithms to recognize appliances in the home at the beginning of a NILM setup is a big hindrance to wide adoption of the technique,Background,msa_2093735991
One of the recent advances in this research area includes the addition of an Electro-Magnetic Field ( EMF ) sensor that measures the electric and magnetic field nearby an appliance to detect its operational state,Background,msa_2093735991
"This information , when coupled with the aggregate power consumption data for the home , can help to train a NILM system , which is a significant step forward in automating the training phase",Background,msa_2093735991
This paper explores the theory behind the operation of the EMF sensor and discusses the feasibility of,Purpose,msa_2093735991
automating the training and classification process using these devices,Mechanism,msa_2093735991
"A case study is presented , where magnetic field measurements of eight appliances are analyzed to determine the viability of using these signals alone to determine the type of appliance that the EMF sensor has been placed next to",Method,msa_2093735991
"Various dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to the collected data , and the resulting feature vectors are used to train a variety of common machine learning classifiers",Mechanism,msa_2093735991
"A vector subspace obtained using Independent Component Analysis ( ICA ) , along with a k-NN classifier , was found to perform best among the different alternatives explored",Findings,msa_2093735991
"High-data-rate sensors , such as video cameras , are becoming ubiquitous in the Internet of Things",Background,msa_2094547360
"This article describes GigaSight ,",Mechanism,msa_2094547360
an Internet-scale repository of crowd-sourced video content,Purpose,msa_2094547360
", with strong enforcement of privacy preferences and access controls",Mechanism,msa_2094547360
"The GigaSight architecture is a federated system of VM-based cloudlets that perform video analytics at the edge of the Internet , thus reducing the demand for ingress bandwidth into the cloud",Mechanism,msa_2094547360
"Denaturing , which is an owner-specific reduction in fidelity of video content to preserve privacy , is one form of analytics on cloudlets",Mechanism,msa_2094547360
Content-based indexing for search is another form of cloudlet-based analytics,Mechanism,msa_2094547360

"Many vision tasks require a multi-class classifier to discriminate multiple categories , on the order of hundreds or thousands",Background,msa_2095181741
"In this paper , we propose sparse output coding ,",Mechanism,msa_2095181741
"a principled way for large-scale multi-class classification ,",Purpose,msa_2095181741
by turning high-cardinality multi-class categorization into a bit-by-bit decoding problem,Mechanism,msa_2095181741
"Specifically , sparse output coding is composed of two steps : efficient coding matrix learning with scalability to thousands of classes , and probabilistic decoding",Mechanism,msa_2095181741
Empirical results,Findings,msa_2095181741
on object recognition and scene classification,Method,msa_2095181741
Computers have the potential to significantly extend the practice of popular music based on steady tempo and mostly determined form,Background,msa_2096085895
"There are significant challenges to overcome , however , due to constraints including accurate timing based on beats and adherence to a form or structure despite possible changes that may occur , possibly even during performance",Purpose,msa_2096085895
We describe an approach to synchronization across media that,Mechanism,msa_2096085895
takes into account latency due to communication delays and audio buffering,Purpose,msa_2096085895
We also address,Mechanism,msa_2096085895
the problem of mapping from a conventional score,Purpose,msa_2096085895
"Noisy , high-dimensional time series observations can often be described by a set of low-dimensional latent variables",Background,msa_2096126430
Commonly used methods to extract these latent variables typically assume instantaneous relationships between the latent and observed variables,Background,msa_2096126430
"In many physical systems , changes in the latent variables manifest as changes in the observed variables after time delays",Background,msa_2096126430
"Techniques that do not account for these delays can recover a larger number of latent variables than are present in the system , thereby making the latent representation more difficult to interpret",Purpose,msa_2096126430
"In this work , we introduce a novel probabilistic technique , time-delay gaussian-process factor analysis TD-GPFA ,",Mechanism,msa_2096126430
that performs dimensionality reduction,Purpose,msa_2096126430
in the presence of a different time delay between each pair of latent and observed variables,Mechanism,msa_2096126430
We demonstrate how using a gaussian process to model the evolution of each latent variable allows us to tractably learn these delays over a continuous domain,Mechanism,msa_2096126430
"Additionally , we show how TD-GPFA combines temporal smoothing and dimensionality reduction into a common probabilistic framework",Mechanism,msa_2096126430
We present an expectation/conditional maximization either ECME algorithm to learn the model parameters,Mechanism,msa_2096126430
Our simulations,Method,msa_2096126430
"demonstrate that when time delays are present , TD-GPFA is able to correctly identify these delays and recover the latent space",Findings,msa_2096126430
We then applied TD-GPFA to the activity of tens of neurons recorded simultaneously in the macaque motor cortex during a reaching task,Method,msa_2096126430
"TD-GPFA is able to better describe the neural activity using a more parsimonious latent space than GPFA , a method that has been used to interpret motor cortex data but does not account for time delays",Findings,msa_2096126430
There has been significant interest and progress recently in algorithms that solve regression problems involving tall and thin matrices in input sparsity time,Background,msa_2096908304
"Given a n * d matrix where n g d , these algorithms find an approximation with fewer rows , allowing one to solve a poly ( d ) sized problem instead",Purpose,msa_2096908304
"In practice , the best performances are often obtained by invoking these routines in an iterative fashion",Purpose,msa_2096908304
We show these iterative methods can be adapted,Mechanism,msa_2096908304
to give theoretical guarantees comparable to and better than the current state of the art,Purpose,msa_2096908304
"Our approaches are based on computing the importances of the rows , known as leverage scores , in an iterative manner",Mechanism,msa_2096908304
We show that alternating between computing a short matrix estimate and finding more accurate approximate leverage scores leads to a series of geometrically smaller instances,Mechanism,msa_2096908304
This gives an algorithm whose runtime is input sparsity plus an overhead comparable to the cost of solving a regression problem on the smaller approximation,Mechanism,msa_2096908304
Abstract Genes are often combinatorially regulated by multiple transcription factors ( TFs ),Background,msa_2097643762
Such combinatorial regulation plays an important role in development and facilitates the ability of cells to respond to different stresses,Background,msa_2097643762
"While a number of approaches have utilized sequence and ChIP-based datasets to study combinational regulation , these have often ignored the combinational logic and the dynamics associated with such regulation",Purpose,msa_2097643762
"Here we present cDREM , a new method",Mechanism,msa_2097643762
for reconstructing dynamic models of combinatorial regulation,Purpose,msa_2097643762
cDREM integrates time series gene expression data with ( static ) protein interaction data,Mechanism,msa_2097643762
"The method is based on a hidden Markov model and utilizes the sparse group Lasso to identify small subsets of combinatorially active TFs , their time of activation , and the logical function they implement",Mechanism,msa_2097643762
We tested cDREM on yeast and human data sets,Method,msa_2097643762
Using yeast,Method,msa_2097643762
This technical note studies the impact of side initial state information on the detectability of data deception attacks against cyber-physical systems,Purpose,msa_2098489504
We assume the attack detector has access to a linear function of the initial system state that can not be altered by an attacker,Method,msa_2098489504
"First , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an attack to be undetectable by any dynamic attack detector under each specific side information pattern",Method,msa_2098489504
"Second , we characterize attacks that can be sustained for arbitrarily long periods without being detected",Method,msa_2098489504
"Third , we define the zero state inducing attack , the only type of attack that remains dynamically undetectable regardless of the side initial state information available to the attack detector",Method,msa_2098489504
"Finally , we design a dynamic attack detector",Mechanism,msa_2098489504

Several researchers proposed using non-Euclidean metrics on point sets in Euclidean space for clustering noisy data,Background,msa_2098790909
"Almost always , a distance function is desired that recognizes the closeness of the points in the same cluster , even if the Euclidean cluster diameter is large",Background,msa_2098790909
"There- fore , it is preferred to assign smaller costs to the paths that stay close to the input points",Purpose,msa_2098790909
"In this paper , we consider a natural metric with this property ,",Purpose,msa_2098790909
We present an algorithm that,Mechanism,msa_2099143789
"on input of an $ n $ -vertex $ m $ -edge weighted graph $ G $ and a value $ k $ produces an incremental sparsifier $ \hat { G } $ with $ n-1 + m/k $ edges , such that the relative condition number of $ G $ with $ \hat { G } $ is bounded above by $ \tilde { O } ( k\log^2 n ) $ , with probability $ 1-p $ ( we use the $ \tilde { O } ( ) $ notation to hide a factor of at most $ ( \log\log n ) ^4 $ )",Purpose,msa_2099143789
"Linear subspace learning methods such as Fisher 's Linear Discriminant Analysis ( LDA ) , Unsupervised Discriminant Projection ( UDP ) , and Locality Preserving Projections ( LPP ) have been widely used in face recognition applications as a tool to capture low dimensional discriminant information",Background,msa_2099593527
"However , when these methods are applied in the context of face recognition , they often encounter the small-sample-size problem",Background,msa_2099593527
"In order to overcome this problem , a separate Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) step is usually adopted to reduce the dimensionality of the data",Background,msa_2099593527
"However , such a step may discard dimensions that contain important discriminative information that can aid classification performance",Purpose,msa_2099593527
"In this work , we propose a new idea which we named Multi-class Fukunaga Koontz Discriminant Analysis ( FKDA ) by incorporating the Fukunaga Koontz Transform within the optimization",Mechanism,msa_2099593527
"for maximizing class separation criteria in LDA , UDP , and LPP",Purpose,msa_2099593527
"In contrast to traditional LDA , UDP , and LPP , our approach can work with very high dimensional data as input , without requiring a separate dimensionality reduction step to make the scatter matrices full rank",Mechanism,msa_2099593527
"In addition , the FKDA formulation seeks optimal projection direction vectors that are orthogonal which the existing methods can not guarantee , and it has the capability of finding the exact solutions to the `` trace ratio '' objective in discriminant analysis problems while traditional methods can only deal with a relaxed and inexact `` ratio trace '' objective",Mechanism,msa_2099593527
"We have shown using six face database , in the context of large scale unconstrained face recognition , face recognition with occlusions , and illumination invariant face recognition , under `` closed set '' , `` semi-open set '' , and `` open set '' recognition scenarios ,",Method,msa_2099593527
that our proposed FKDA significantly outperforms traditional linear discriminant subspace learning methods as well as five other competing algorithms,Findings,msa_2099593527
Online consumers are uncertain about subjective product quality e,Background,msa_2099686863
", fit and feel of clothing and texture of materials because of the absence of experiential information",Background,msa_2099686863
"In this paper , we examine the dynamic change of the products purchased online over time in the presence of this type of uncertainty",Purpose,msa_2099686863
"Using individual-level transaction data ,",Method,msa_2099686863
we find that consumers purchase products with a high degree of product uncertainty as their online shopping experiences help them better estimate product quality,Findings,msa_2099686863
Our results also show that the average and highest prices of market baskets decrease around 1 % when online shopping experience increases 10 %,Findings,msa_2099686863
"This implies that online consumers are reluctant to buy expensive products with only digitally transferred information , whereas they tend to purchase more of the cheaper products online along with their accumulated online shopping experience",Background,msa_2099686863
We also verify the interaction effects of product uncertainty and product price on online consumers ' purchase decision,Method,msa_2099686863
"When online consumers buy products priced under $ 50 , they readily buy products with a high degree of product uncertainty regardless of their online shopping experience",Findings,msa_2099686863
"But consumers are unlikely to buy expensive products online if there is a high degree of product uncertainty , even when they have accumulated much online shopping experience",Findings,msa_2099686863
"In addition , we find that online vendors can effectively overcome product-level uncertainty by taking advantage of retailer reputation in the physical world and through the use of digitized video commercials",Findings,msa_2099686863
Our study on the dynamics in the set of products purchased online expands the understanding of consumer purchase behavior under uncertainty,Background,msa_2099686863

Self-paced learning ( SPL ) is a recently proposed learning regime inspired by the learning process of humans and animals that gradually incorporates easy to more complex samples into training,Background,msa_2100913937
Existing methods are limited in that they ignore an important aspect in learning : diversity,Purpose,msa_2100913937
"To incorporate this information ,",Purpose,msa_2100913937
"we propose an approach called self-paced learning with diversity ( SPLD ) which formalizes the preference for both easy and diverse samples into a general regularizes This regularization term is independent of the learning objective , and thus can be easily generalized into various learning tasks",Mechanism,msa_2100913937
"Albeit non-convex , the optimization of the variables included in this SPLD regularization term for sample selection can be globally solved in linearithmic time",Mechanism,msa_2100913937
We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the conventional SPL,Findings,msa_2100913937
on three real-world datasets,Method,msa_2100913937
"Given a directed graph of millions of nodes , how can we automatically spot anomalous , suspicious nodes , judging only from their connectivity patterns ?",Purpose,msa_2101447063
"Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications , from Twitter users who buy fake followers , manipulating the social network , to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks , disturbing the network traffic graph",Background,msa_2101447063
"We propose a fast and effective method , CatchSync , which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters : ( a ) synchronized behavior : suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior pattern , because they are often required to perform some task together ( such as follow the same user ) ; and ( b ) rare behavior : their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority",Mechanism,msa_2101447063
We introduce novel measures,Mechanism,msa_2101447063
to quantify both concepts ( `` synchronicity '' and `` normality '' ),Purpose,msa_2101447063
and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots,Mechanism,msa_2101447063
"Thanks to careful design , CatchSync has the following desirable properties : ( a ) it is scalable to large datasets , being linear on the graph size ; ( b ) it is parameter free ; and ( c ) it is side-information-oblivious : it can operate using only the topology , without needing labeled data , nor timing information , etc",Mechanism,msa_2101447063
", while still capable of using side information , if available",Mechanism,msa_2101447063
"We applied CatchSync on two large , real datasets 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph and 3-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graph , and several synthetic ones ;",Method,msa_2101447063
Regularization has played a key role in deriving sensible estimators in high dimensional statistical inference,Background,msa_2102026903
A substantial amount of recent works has argued for nonconvex regularizers in favor of their superior theoretical properties and excellent practical performances,Background,msa_2102026903
"In a dierent but analogous vein , nonconvex loss functions are promoted because of their robustness against \outliers ''",Background,msa_2102026903
"However , these nonconvex formulations are computationally more challenging , especially in the presence of nonsmoothness and nonseparability",Purpose,msa_2102026903
"To address this issue ,",Purpose,msa_2102026903
we propose a new proximal gradient meta-algorithm by rigorously extending the proximal average to the nonconvex setting,Mechanism,msa_2102026903

Motivation : Synaptic connections underlie learning and memory in the brain and are dynamically formed and eliminated during development and in response to stimuli,Background,msa_2104221896
Quantifying changes in overall density and strength of synapses is an important pre-requisite for studying connectivity and plasticity in these cases or in diseased conditions,Background,msa_2104221896
"Unfortunately , most techniques to detect such changes are either low-throughput ( e",Purpose,msa_2104221896

"Unlike algorithms that focus on distributed learning in either the big data or big model setting ( but not both ) , our scheme partitions both the data and model variables simultaneously",Mechanism,msa_2104450883
"This not only leads to faster learning on distributed clusters , but also enables machine learning applications where both data and model are too large to fit within the memory of a single machine",Mechanism,msa_2104450883
"Furthermore , our scheme allows worker machines to perform additional updates while waiting for slow workers to finish , which provides users with a tunable synchronization strategy that can be set based on learning needs and cluster conditions",Mechanism,msa_2104450883

Phylogenetic algorithms have begun to see widespread use in cancer research to reconstruct processes of evolution in tumor progression,Background,msa_2104801871

"Since users from different communities tend to have varying tastes and interests , capturing communitylevel temporal change can improve the understanding and management of social content",Background,msa_2104918168
"Additionally , it can further facilitate the applications such as community discovery , temporal prediction and online marketing",Background,msa_2104918168
"However , this kind of extraction becomes challenging due to the intricate interactions between community and topic , and intractable computational complexity",Purpose,msa_2104918168
"In this paper , we take a unified solution towards the communitylevel topic dynamic extraction",Mechanism,msa_2104918168
"A probabilistic model , CosTot ( Community Specific Topics-over-Time ) is proposed to uncover the hidden topics and communities , as well as capture community-specific temporal dynamics",Mechanism,msa_2104918168
"Specifically , CosTot considers text , time , and network information simultaneously , and well discovers the interactions between community and topic over time",Mechanism,msa_2104918168
"We then discuss the approximate inference implementation to enable scalable computation of model parameters , especially for large social data",Mechanism,msa_2104918168
"Based on this , the application layer support for multi-scale temporal analysis and community exploration is also investigated",Method,msa_2104918168
We conduct extensive experimental studies on a large real microblog dataset,Method,msa_2104918168
The goal of supervised feature selection is to find a subset of input features that are responsible for predicting output values,Background,msa_2105465844
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( Lasso ) allows computationally efficient feature selection based on linear dependency between input features and output values,Purpose,msa_2105465844
"In this paper , we consider a feature-wise kernelized Lasso",Mechanism,msa_2105465844
for capturing non-linear input-output dependency,Purpose,msa_2105465844
"We first show that , with particular choices of kernel functions , non-redundant features with strong statistical dependence on output values can be found in terms of kernel-based independence measures such as the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion ( HSIC )",Mechanism,msa_2105465844
We then show that the globally optimal solution can be efficiently computed ; this makes the approach scalable to high-dimensional problems,Mechanism,msa_2105465844
"As our society is increasingly aging , it is urgent to develop computer aided techniques to improve the quality-of-care ( QoC ) and quality-of-life ( QoL ) of geriatric patients",Purpose,msa_2105733800
"In this paper , we focus on automatic human activities analysis in video surveillance recorded in complicated environments at a nursing home",Mechanism,msa_2105733800
This will enable the automatic exploration of the statistical patterns between patients ' daily activities and their clinical diagnosis,Mechanism,msa_2105733800

"including smooth and comfortable trajectory generation and following ; lane keeping and lane changing ; intersection handling with or without V2I and V2V ; and pedestrian , bicyclist , and workzone detection",Mechanism,msa_2107656445
Safety and reliability features include a fault-tolerant computing system ; smooth and intuitive autonomous-manual switching ; and the ability to fully disengage and power down the drive-by-wire and computing system upon E-stop,Mechanism,msa_2107656445
Game-theoretic algorithms for physical security have made an impressive real-world impact,Background,msa_2108111486
"These algorithms compute an optimal strategy for the defender to commit to in a Stackelberg game , where the attacker observes the defender 's strategy and best-responds",Background,msa_2108111486
"In order to build the game model , though , the payoffs of potential attackers for various outcomes must be estimated ; inaccurate estimates can lead to significant inefficiencies",Purpose,msa_2108111486
We design an algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2108111486
that optimizes the defender 's strategy with no prior information,Purpose,msa_2108111486

Tablet computers are often called upon to emulate classical pen-and-paper input,Background,msa_2109830222
"However , touchscreens typically lack the means to distinguish between legitimate stylus and finger touches and touches with the palm or other parts of the hand",Purpose,msa_2109830222
"This forces users to rest their palms elsewhere or hover above the screen , resulting in ergonomic and usability problems",Purpose,msa_2109830222
We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that uses the temporal evolution of touch contacts,Mechanism,msa_2109830222
to reject palms,Purpose,msa_2109830222
Most algorithmic matches in fielded kidney exchanges do not result in an actual transplant,Background,msa_2111490728
"In this paper , we address the problem of cycles and chains in a proposed match failing after the matching algorithm has committed to them",Purpose,msa_2111490728
We show that failure-aware kidney exchange can significantly increase the expected number of lives saved,Findings,msa_2111490728

"From the computational viewpoint , we design a branch-and-price-based optimal clearing algorithm specifically",Mechanism,msa_2111490728
for the probabilistic exchange clearing problem,Purpose,msa_2111490728
and show that this new solver scales well,Findings,msa_2111490728
Cloud offload is an important technique in mobile computing,Background,msa_2111581171
VM-based cloudlets have been proposed as offload sites for the resource-intensive and latency-sensitive computations typically associated with mobile multimedia applications,Background,msa_2111581171
"Since cloud offload relies on precisely-configured back-end software , it is difficult to support at global scale across cloudlets in multiple domains",Purpose,msa_2111581171
"To address this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2111581171
we describe just-in-time ( JIT ) provisioning of cloudlets under the control of an associated mobile device,Mechanism,msa_2111581171

"The average person can skillfully manipulate a plethora of tools , from hammers to tweezers",Background,msa_2111687945
"However , despite this remarkable dexterity , gestures on today 's touch devices are simplistic , relying primarily on the chording of fingers : one -finger pan , two -finger pinch , four -finger swipe and similar",Purpose,msa_2111687945
We propose that touch gesture design be inspired by the manipulation of physical tools from the real world,Mechanism,msa_2111687945
"In this way , we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools",Mechanism,msa_2111687945

"Location sharing is a popular feature of online social networks , but challenges remain in the effective presentation of privacy choices to users , whose location sharing preferences are complex and diverse",Background,msa_2112032833
"One proposed approach for capturing these nuances builds on the observation that key attributes of users ' location sharing preferences can be represented by a small number of privacy profiles , which can provide a basis for configuring individual preferences",Background,msa_2112032833
"However , the impact of this approach on how users view their privacy is relatively unknown",Purpose,msa_2112032833
We present a study,Method,msa_2112032833
evaluating the impact of this approach on users ' location sharing preferences and their satisfaction with the decisions made by their resulting settings,Purpose,msa_2112032833
The results suggest that this approach can influence users to share significantly more without a substantial difference in comfort,Findings,msa_2112032833
The proliferation of touchscreen devices has made soft keyboards a routine part of life,Background,msa_2112261049
"However , ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony SmartWatch and Apple iPod Nano lack a means of text entry",Purpose,msa_2112261049
"This limits their potential , despite the fact they are quite capable computers",Purpose,msa_2112261049
"In this work , we present a soft keyboard interaction technique called ZoomBoard",Mechanism,msa_2112261049
that enables text entry on ultra-small devices,Purpose,msa_2112261049
Our approach uses iterative zooming to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size,Mechanism,msa_2112261049
"We based our design on a QWERTY layout , so that it is immediately familiar to users and leverages existing skill",Mechanism,msa_2112261049
"As the ultimate test , we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16 x 6mm - smaller than a US penny",Method,msa_2112261049
Meeting service level objectives ( SLOs ) for tail latency is an important and challenging open problem in cloud computing infrastructures,Purpose,msa_2112319566
The challenges are exacerbated by burstiness in the workloads,Purpose,msa_2112319566
This paper describes PriorityMeister -- a system that employs a combination of per-workload priorities and rate limits,Mechanism,msa_2112319566
to provide tail latency QoS for shared networked storage,Purpose,msa_2112319566
", even with bursty workloads",Mechanism,msa_2112319566
PriorityMeister automatically and proactively configures workload priorities and rate limits across multiple stages ( e,Mechanism,msa_2112319566
", a shared storage stage followed by a shared network stage ) to meet end-to-end tail latency SLOs",Mechanism,msa_2112319566
"In real system experiments and under production trace workloads ,",Method,msa_2112319566

"With an explosion of popularity of online photo sharing , we can trivially collect a huge number of photo streams for any interesting topics such as scuba diving as an outdoor recreational activity class",Background,msa_2112378258
"Obviously , the retrieved photo streams are neither aligned nor calibrated since they are taken in different temporal , spatial , and personal perspectives",Purpose,msa_2112378258
"However , at the same time , they are likely to share common storylines that consist of sequences of events and activities frequently recurred within the topic",Purpose,msa_2112378258
"In this paper ,",Mechanism,msa_2112378258
"as a first technical step to detect such collective storylines ,",Purpose,msa_2112378258
we propose an approach,Mechanism,msa_2112378258
to jointly aligning and segmenting uncalibrated multiple photo streams,Purpose,msa_2112378258
"The alignment task discovers the matched images between different photo streams , and the image segmentation task parses each image into multiple meaningful regions to facilitate the image understanding",Mechanism,msa_2112378258
We close a loop between the two tasks so that solving one task helps enhance the performance of the other in a mutually rewarding way,Mechanism,msa_2112378258
"To this end , we design a scalable message-passing based optimization framework to jointly achieve both tasks for the whole input image set at once",Mechanism,msa_2112378258

We study the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium in large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games,Purpose,msa_2112452549
"While this problem can be solved in polynomial time , first-order or regret-based methods are usually preferred for large games",Purpose,msa_2112452549
"Regret-based methods have largely been favored in practice , in spite of their theoretically inferior convergence rates",Background,msa_2112452549
In this paper we investigate the acceleration of first-order methods both theoretically and experimentally,Mechanism,msa_2112452549
An important component of many first-order methods is a distance-generating function,Mechanism,msa_2112452549
"Motivated by this , we investigate a specific distance-generating function , namely the dilated entropy function , over treeplexes , which are convex polytopes that encompass the strategy spaces of perfect-recall extensive-form games",Mechanism,msa_2112452549
We develop significantly stronger bounds on the associated strong convexity parameter,Mechanism,msa_2112452549
"In terms of extensive-form game solving , this improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of O ( ( # information sets depth M ) / ( 2 depth ) ) where M is the maximum value of the l 1 norm over the treeplex encoding the strategy spaces",Mechanism,msa_2112452549
"Experimentally , we investigate the performance of three first-order methods ( the excessive gap technique , mirror prox , and stochastic mirror prox ) and compare their performance to the regret-based algorithms",Method,msa_2112452549
"In order to instantiate stochastic mirror prox , we develop a class of gradient sampling schemes for game trees",Mechanism,msa_2112452549

"Distributed machine learning has typically been approached from a data parallel perspective , where big data are partitioned to multiple workers and an algorithm is executed concurrently over different data subsets under various synchronization schemes to ensure speed-up and/or correctness",Background,msa_2113547287
"A sibling problem that has received relatively less attention is how to ensure efficient and correct model parallel execution of ML algorithms , where parameters of an ML program are partitioned to different workers and undergone concurrent iterative updates",Purpose,msa_2113547287
"We argue that model and data parallelisms impose rather different challenges for system design , algorithmic adjustment , and theoretical analysis",Purpose,msa_2113547287
"In this paper , we develop a system for model-parallelism , STRADS , that provides a programming abstraction for scheduling parameter updates by discovering and leveraging changing structural properties of ML programs",Mechanism,msa_2113547287
"STRADS enables a flexible tradeoff between scheduling efficiency and fidelity to intrinsic dependencies within the models , and improves memory efficiency of distributed ML",Mechanism,msa_2113547287
"Computational cancer phylogenetics seeks to enumerate the temporal sequences of aberrations in tumor evolution , thereby delineating the evolution of possible tumor progression pathways , molecular subtypes , and mechanisms of action",Background,msa_2114204060
We previously developed a pipeline for constructing phylogenies describing evolution between major recurring cell types computationally inferred from whole-genome tumor profiles,Background,msa_2114204060
"The accuracy and detail of the phylogenies , however , depend on the identification of accurate , high-resolution molecular markers of progression , i",Purpose,msa_2114204060
", reproducible regions of aberration that robustly differentiate different subtypes and stages of progression",Purpose,msa_2114204060
"Here , we present a novel hidden Markov model ( HMM ) scheme",Mechanism,msa_2114204060
for the problem of inferring such phylogenetically significant markers,Purpose,msa_2114204060
through joint segmentation and calling of multisample tumor data,Mechanism,msa_2114204060
Our method classifies sets of genome-wide DNA copy number measurements into a partitioning of samples into normal ( diploid ) or amplified at each probe,Mechanism,msa_2114204060
"It differs from other similar HMM methods in its design specifically for the needs of tumor phylogenetics , by seeking to identify robust markers of progression conserved across a set of copy number profiles",Mechanism,msa_2114204060

"We present Air+Touch , a new class of interactions that interweave touch events with in-air gestures ,",Mechanism,msa_2114977140
offering a unified input modality with expressiveness greater than each input modality alone,Purpose,msa_2114977140
"We demonstrate how air and touch are highly complementary : touch is used to designate targets and segment in-air gestures , while in-air gestures add expressivity to touch events",Mechanism,msa_2114977140
"For example , a user can draw a circle in the air and tap to trigger a context menu , do a finger 'high jump ' between two touches to select a region of text , or drag and in-air 'pigtail ' to copy text to the clipboard",Mechanism,msa_2114977140
"Through an observational study ,",Method,msa_2114977140
"we devised a basic taxonomy of Air+Touch interactions , based on whether the in-air component occurs before , between or after touches",Mechanism,msa_2114977140
Recent trends in System-on-a-Chip show that an increasing number of special-purpose processors are being added to improve the efficiency of common operations,Background,msa_2115069656
"Unfortunately , the use of these processors may introduce suspension delays incurred by communication , synchronization and external I/O operations",Background,msa_2115069656
"When these processors are used in real-time systems , conventional schedulability analyses incorporate these delays in the worst-case execution/response time , hence significantly reducing the schedulable utilization",Background,msa_2115069656
"In this paper , we provide schedulability analyses",Purpose,msa_2115069656
and propose segment-fixed priority scheduling,Mechanism,msa_2115069656
for self-suspending tasks,Purpose,msa_2115069656
We model the tasks as segments of execution separated by suspensions,Mechanism,msa_2115069656
We start from providing response-time analyses for self-suspending tasks under Rate Monotonic Scheduling ( RMS ),Method,msa_2115069656
"While RMS is shown to not be optimal , it can be used effectively in some special cases that we have identified",Findings,msa_2115069656
We then derive a utilization bound for the cases as a function of the ratio of the suspension duration to the period of the tasks,Mechanism,msa_2115069656
"For general cases , we develop a segment-fixed priority scheduling scheme",Mechanism,msa_2115069656
Our scheme assigns individual segments different priorities and phase offsets that are used for phase enforcement to control the unexpected self-suspending nature,Mechanism,msa_2115069656

"Cloud-sourced virtual appliances ( VAs ) have been touted as powerful solutions for many software maintenance , mobility , backward compatibility , and security challenges",Background,msa_2115860724
"In this paper , we ask whether it is possible",Purpose,msa_2115860724
to create a VA cloud service,Mechanism,msa_2115860724
"that supports fluid , interactive user experience even over mobile networks",Purpose,msa_2115860724
"More specifically , we wish to support a YouTube-like streaming service for executable content , such as games , interactive books , research artifacts , etc",Mechanism,msa_2115860724
"Users should be able to post , browse through , and interact with executable content swiftly and without long interruptions",Mechanism,msa_2115860724
"Intuitively , this seems impossible ; the bandwidths , latencies , and costs of last-mile networks would be prohibitive given the sheer sizes of virtual machines ! Yet , we show that a set of carefully crafted , novel prefetching and streaming techniques can bring this goal surprisingly close to reality",Mechanism,msa_2115860724

"The model has been proposed by multiple researchers within the past year , yet previous papers have been substantially limited in their analysis of the method and in the ability to solve large-scale problems",Mechanism,msa_2116150816
"In this paper , we make three contributions : 1 ) we develop a second-order active-set method which is several orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed optimization approaches for this problem ,",Mechanism,msa_2116150816

We study the phase transition of the coalitional manipulation problem for generalized scoring rules,Purpose,msa_2117293368
"Previously it has been shown that , under some conditions on the distribution of votes , if the number of manipulators is o ( n ) , where n is the number of voters , then the probability that a random profile is manipulable by the coalition goes to zero as the number of voters goes to infinity , whereas if the number of manipulators is ( n ) , then the probability that a random profile is manipulable goes to one",Background,msa_2117293368
"Here we consider the critical window , where a coalition has size cn ,",Mechanism,msa_2117293368
"and we show that as c goes from zero to infinity , the limiting probability that a random profile is manipulable goes from zero to one in a smooth fashion , i",Findings,msa_2117293368

Real-time captioning provides people who are deaf or hard of hearing access to speech in settings such as classrooms and live events,Background,msa_2117887941
"The most reliable approach to provide these captions is to recruit an expert stenographer who is able to type at natural speaking rates , but they charge more than $ 100 USD per hour and must be scheduled in advance",Purpose,msa_2117887941

"Each person is unable to type at natural speaking rates , and so is asked only to type part of what they hear",Mechanism,msa_2117887941
Scribe automatically stitches all of the partial captions together to form a complete caption stream,Mechanism,msa_2117887941
Distributed online groups have great potential for generating interdependent and complex products like encyclopedia articles or product design,Background,msa_2118153153
"However , coordinating multiple group members to work together effectively while minimizing process losses remains an open challenge",Purpose,msa_2118153153
We conducted an experiment comparing the effectiveness of two coordination strategies ( simultaneous vs,Method,msa_2118153153
sequential work ) on a complex creative task as the number of group members increased,Method,msa_2118153153
"Our results indicate that , contrary to prior work , a sequential work structure was more effective than a simultaneous work structure as the size of the group increased",Findings,msa_2118153153

"In a multimillion-node network of who-follows-whom like Twitter , since a high count of followers leads to higher profits , users have the incentive to boost their in-degree",Background,msa_2118422001
"Can we spot the suspicious following behavior , which may indicate zombie followers and suspicious followees ? To answer the above question",Purpose,msa_2118422001
", we propose CatchSync , which exploits two tell-tale signs of the suspicious behavior : ( a ) synchronized behavior : the zombie followers have extremely similar following behavior pattern , because , say , they are generated by a script ; and ( b ) abnormal behavior : their behavior pattern is very different from the majority",Mechanism,msa_2118422001
Our CatchSync introduces novel measures to quantify both concepts and catches the suspicious behavior,Mechanism,msa_2118422001

How can one build a distributed framework that allows efficient deployment of a wide spectrum of modern advanced machine learning ( ML ) programs for industrial-scale problems using Big Models ( 100s of billions of parameters ) on Big Data ( terabytes or petabytes ) -,Purpose,msa_2119391823
"Contemporary parallelization strategies employ fine-grained operations and scheduling beyond the classic bulk-synchronous processing paradigm popularized by MapReduce , or even specialized operators relying on graphical representations of ML programs",Background,msa_2119391823
"The variety of approaches tends to pull systems and algorithms design in different directions , and it remains difficult to find a universal platform applicable to a wide range of different ML programs at scale",Purpose,msa_2119391823
"We propose a general-purpose framework that systematically addresses data- and model-parallel challenges in large-scale ML , by leveraging several fundamental properties underlying ML programs that make them different from conventional operation-centric programs : error tolerance , dynamic structure , and nonuniform convergence ; all stem from the optimization-centric nature shared in ML programs ' mathematical definitions , and the iterative-convergent behavior of their algorithmic solutions",Mechanism,msa_2119391823
"These properties present unique opportunities for an integrative system design , built on bounded-latency network synchronization and dynamic load-balancing scheduling , which is efficient , programmable , and enjoys provable correctness guarantees",Mechanism,msa_2119391823
"We demonstrate how such a design in light of ML-first principles leads to significant performance improvements versus well-known implementations of several ML programs , allowing them to run in much less time and at considerably larger model sizes ,",Findings,msa_2119391823
"In this paper , we address the problem of discovering topically meaningful , yet compact ( densely connected ) communities in a social network",Purpose,msa_2120119131
"Assuming the social network to be an integer-weighted graph ( where the weights can be intuitively defined as the number of common friends , followers , documents exchanged , etc",Mechanism,msa_2120119131
") , we transform the social network to a more efficient representation",Mechanism,msa_2120119131
"In this new representation , each user is a bag of her one-hop neighbors",Mechanism,msa_2120119131
We propose a mixed-membership model to identify compact communities using this transformation,Mechanism,msa_2120119131
"Next , we augment the representation and the model to incorporate user-content information imposing topical consistency in the communities",Mechanism,msa_2120119131
In our model a user can belong to multiple communities and a community can participate in multiple topics,Mechanism,msa_2120119131
This allows us to discover community memberships as well as community and user interests,Mechanism,msa_2120119131
Our method outperforms other well known baselines,Findings,msa_2120119131

"Recently , data with complex characteristics such as epilepsy electroencephalography ( EEG ) time series has emerged",Background,msa_2120838210
"Epilepsy EEG data has special characteristics including nonlinearity , nonnormality , and nonperiodicity",Background,msa_2120838210
"Therefore , it is important to find a suitable forecasting method that covers these special characteristics",Purpose,msa_2120838210
"In this paper , we propose a coercively adjusted autoregression ( CA-AR ) method that forecasts future values from a multivariable epilepsy EEG time series",Mechanism,msa_2120838210
"We use the technique of random coefficients , which forcefully adjusts the coefficients with 1 and 1",Mechanism,msa_2120838210

"Hence , there is a great need for algorithms and software tools that could scale up to the whole omic level , integrate different omic data , leverage rich structure information , and be easily accessible to non-technical users",Purpose,msa_2121006010
"We present GenAMap , an interactive analytics software platform that 1 ) automates the execution of principled machine learning methods that detect genome- and phenome-wide associations among genotypes , gene expression data , and clinical or other macroscopic traits , and 2 ) provides new visualization tools specifically designed to aid in the exploration of association mapping results",Mechanism,msa_2121006010

Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( OTSCC ) is associated with poor prognosis,Background,msa_2122753798
"To improve prognostication ,",Purpose,msa_2122753798
"we analyzed four gene probes ( TERC , CCND1 , EGFR and TP53 ) and the centromere probe CEP4 as a marker of chromosomal instability , using fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) in single cells from the tumors of sixty-five OTSCC patients ( Stage I , n=15 ; Stage II , n=30 ; Stage III , n=7 ; Stage IV , n=13 )",Method,msa_2122753798
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the FISH data distinguished three clusters related to smoking status,Findings,msa_2122753798
"Copy number increases of all five markers were found to be correlated to non-smoking habits , while smokers in this cohort had low-level copy number gains",Findings,msa_2122753798
"Using the phylogenetic modeling software FISHtrees , we constructed models of tumor progression for each patient based on the four gene probes",Mechanism,msa_2122753798
"Then , we derived test statistics on the models that are significant predictors of disease-free and overall survival , independent of tumor stage and smoking status in multivariate analysis",Mechanism,msa_2122753798
The patients whose tumors were modeled as progressing by a more diverse distribution of copy number changes across the four genes have poorer prognosis,Findings,msa_2122753798
This is consistent with the view that multiple genetic pathways need to become deregulated in order for cancer to progress,Findings,msa_2122753798
Whats new ? Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( OTSCC ) is a rare head and neck cancer that typically is asymptomatic in early stages,Background,msa_2122753798
"Hence , in order to improve prognosis in OTSCC , predictive biomarkers that are independent of tumor stage must be identified",Purpose,msa_2122753798
"Here , using four fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) gene probes and the software FISHtrees , phylogenetic tree models of tumor progression in OTSCC patients were constructed",Mechanism,msa_2122753798
Smartphone users are often unaware of the data collected by apps running on their devices,Background,msa_2123307077
We report on a study,Purpose,msa_2123307077
that evaluates the benefits of giving users an app permission manager and sending them nudges,Method,msa_2123307077
intended to raise their awareness of the data collected by their apps,Purpose,msa_2123307077
Our study provides both qualitative and quantitative evidence that these approaches are complementary and can each play a significant role in empowering users to more effectively control their privacy,Findings,msa_2123307077
"For instance , even after a week with access to the permission manager , participants benefited from nudges showing them how often some of their sensitive data was being accessed by apps , with 95 % of participants reassessing their permissions , and 58 % of them further restricting some of their permissions",Findings,msa_2123307077
"We discuss how participants interacted both with the permission manager and the privacy nudges , analyze the effectiveness of both solutions ,",Findings,msa_2123307077

Inadequate information interoperability in facility management ( FM ) activities costs time and money being wasted for searching for the needed information in many different data sources,Background,msa_2124926379
"An integrated building information model ( BIM ) , depicting as-is conditions , has a high potential to minimize such wastes",Background,msa_2124926379
"However , facility managers still face the challenge of generating as-is building information models for existing facilities",Background,msa_2124926379
A main problem with current approaches for generating as-is BIMs is that they mainly focus on capturing and providing geometric information,Purpose,msa_2124926379
"Many other types of information are missing , such as equipment warranty and technical parameters",Purpose,msa_2124926379
The research described in this paper targets,Mechanism,msa_2124926379

We approach the problem of estimating the parameters of a latent tree graphical model from a hierarchical tensor decomposition point of view,Purpose,msa_2125124498
"In this new view , the marginal probability table of the observed variables is treated as a tensor , and we show that : ( i ) the latent variables induce low rank structures in various matricizations of the tensor ; ( ii ) this collection of low rank matricizations induces a hierarchical low rank decomposition of the tensor",Mechanism,msa_2125124498
"We further derive an optimization problem for estimating ( alternative ) parameters of a latent tree graphical model , allowing us to represent the marginal probability table of the observed variables in a compact and robust way",Mechanism,msa_2125124498
The optimization problem aims to find the best hierarchical low rank approximation of a tensor in Frobenius norm,Mechanism,msa_2125124498
"For correctly specified latent tree graphical models , we show that a global optimum of the optimization problem can be obtained via a recursive decomposition algorithm",Findings,msa_2125124498
This algorithm recovers previous spectral algorithms for hidden Markov models ( Hsu et al,Findings,msa_2125124498

Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown,Background,msa_2125858773

"to perform MCMC using the correct equilibrium distribution , in a distributed manner",Purpose,msa_2125858773
"Nowadays , facility management ( FM ) teams are facing challenges to generate accurate and semantically-rich as-is BIMs for existing buildings",Background,msa_2126440696
"Current model creation approaches , such as model generation based on point cloud data , mainly capture geometric information of a building and lack to provide additional semantic information about components and other project information",Purpose,msa_2126440696
This paper provides the results of a detailed case study,Purpose,msa_2126440696
that aimed at leveraging existing data sources ( e,Method,msa_2126440696
", archived documents and data in FM systems ) to generate accurate and semanticallyrich as-is BIMs",Method,msa_2126440696
The initial findings from the case study highlighted two main challenges associated with model generation from existing data sources : information extraction and integration,Findings,msa_2126440696
"Existing information for different components is typically stored in heterogeneous data sources with various formats and quality , and hence requires different approaches to extract information",Findings,msa_2126440696
The findings also showed that almost 40 % of the component attributes investigated had conflicting values in existing sources,Findings,msa_2126440696
Formal verification and validation play a crucial role in making cyber-physical systems ( CPS ) safe,Background,msa_2127240436
"Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained , including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics",Background,msa_2127240436
"In CPS , models are essential ; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world",Background,msa_2127240436
"If the real system fits to the model , its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified with respect to the model",Purpose,msa_2127240436
"Otherwise , all bets are off",Purpose,msa_2127240436
"This article introduces ModelPlex , a method",Mechanism,msa_2127240436
ensuring that verification results about models apply to CPS implementations,Purpose,msa_2127240436
ModelPlex provides correctness guarantees for CPS executions at runtime : it combines offline verification of CPS models with runtime validation of system executions for compliance with the model,Mechanism,msa_2127240436
ModelPlex ensures in a provably correct way that the verification results obtained for the model apply to the actual system runs by monitoring the behavior of the world for compliance with the model,Mechanism,msa_2127240436
"If , at some point , the observed behavior no longer complies with the model so that offline verification results no longer apply , ModelPlex initiates provably safe fallback actions , assuming the system dynamics deviation is bounded",Mechanism,msa_2127240436
"This article , furthermore , develops a systematic technique",Mechanism,msa_2127240436
to synthesize provably correct monitors automatically from CPS proofs in differential dynamic logic,Purpose,msa_2127240436
"by a correct-by-construction approach , leading to verifiably correct runtime model validation",Mechanism,msa_2127240436
"Overall , ModelPlex generates provably correct monitor conditions that",Findings,msa_2127240436
", if checked to hold at runtime",Method,msa_2127240436

Demand response has gained significant attention in recent years as it demonstrates potentials to enhance the power system 's operational flexibility in a cost-effective way,Background,msa_2127618983
"Industrial loads such as steel manufacturing plants consume large amounts of electric energy , and their electricity bills account for a remarkable percentage of their total operation cost",Background,msa_2127618983
"Meanwhile , lots of industrial loads are very flexible in terms of adjusting their power consumption rate , e",Background,msa_2127618983
g,Background,msa_2127618983
through switching the transformer tap position,Background,msa_2127618983
"Hence , industrial loads such as the steel plants have both the motivation and the ability to support power system operation through demand response",Purpose,msa_2127618983
"In this paper , we focus on the steel plant and optimize its scheduling",Mechanism,msa_2127618983
to maximize its profits,Purpose,msa_2127618983
Black-box mutational fuzzing is a simple yet effective technique to find bugs in software,Background,msa_2128128820
"Given a set of program-seed pairs , we ask how to schedule the fuzzings of these pairs in order to maximize the number of unique bugs found at any point in time",Purpose,msa_2128128820
We develop an analytic framework using a mathematical model of black-box mutational fuzzing,Mechanism,msa_2128128820
and use it to evaluate 26 existing and new randomized online scheduling algorithms,Method,msa_2128128820
Our experiments,Method,msa_2128128820
Much research on human action recognition has been oriented toward the performance gain on lab-collected datasets,Background,msa_2128840666
"Yet real-world videos are more diverse , with more complicated actions and often only a few of them are precisely labeled",Purpose,msa_2128840666
"Thus , recognizing actions from these videos is a tough mission",Purpose,msa_2128840666
The paucity of labeled real-world videos motivates us to `` borrow '' strength from other resources,Mechanism,msa_2128840666
"Specifically , considering that many lab datasets are available , we propose to harness lab datasets",Mechanism,msa_2128840666
to facilitate the action recognition in real-world videos,Purpose,msa_2128840666
given that the lab and real-world datasets are related,Mechanism,msa_2128840666
"As their action categories are usually inconsistent , we design a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize the classifiers for both sides",Mechanism,msa_2128840666
The general Schatten $ $ p $ $ p -norm is exerted on the two classifiers to explore the shared knowledge between them,Mechanism,msa_2128840666
"In this way , our framework is able to mine the shared knowledge between two datasets even if the two have different action categories , which is a major virtue of our method",Mechanism,msa_2128840666
The shared knowledge is further used to improve the action recognition in the real-world videos,Mechanism,msa_2128840666
Extensive experiments are performed on real-world datasets,Method,msa_2128840666

We study distributed optimization problems when N nodes minimize the sum of their individual costs subject to a common vector variable,Purpose,msa_2129122308
"The costs are convex , have Lipschitz continuous gradient ( with constant L ) , and bounded gradient",Background,msa_2129122308
We propose two fast distributed gradient algorithms based on the centralized Nesterov gradient algorithm and establish their convergence rates in terms of the per-node communications K and the per-node gradient evaluations k,Mechanism,msa_2129122308
"Our first method , Distributed Nesterov Gradient ,",Mechanism,msa_2129122308
achieves rates O ( logK/K ) and O ( logk/k ),Findings,msa_2129122308
"Our second method , Distributed Nesterov gradient with Consensus iterations , assumes at all nodes knowledge of L and ( W ) - the second largest singular value of the N N doubly stochastic weight matrix W",Mechanism,msa_2129122308
It achieves rates O ( 1/ K 2- ) and O ( 1/k 2 ) ( > 0 arbitrarily small ),Findings,msa_2129122308
"Further , we give for both methods explicit dependence of the convergence constants on N and W",Method,msa_2129122308
Simulation,Method,msa_2129122308
"In spite of many favorable characteristics of guided-waves for Nondestructive Evaluation ( NDE ) of pipes , real-world application of these systems is still quite limited",Background,msa_2129228949
"Beside the complexities derived from multi-modal , dispersive and multi-path characteristics of guided-waves , one of the main challenges in guided-wave based NDE of pipelines is sensitivity of these systems to variations of environmental and operational conditions ( EOC )",Purpose,msa_2129228949
This paper investigates the effects of varying EOCs on guilded-wave based NDE of pipelines,Purpose,msa_2129228949
We first provide a review of the studies to date in the field of guided-wave based testing to identify research gaps for enhancing the application of these systems in pipeline NDE,Method,msa_2129228949
"To study the identified gaps , guided-wave data from a fully operational piping system , with continuously varying flow rate and temperature , is used",Method,msa_2129228949
Time-shift and amplitude drift effects due to flow rate variations are evaluated along with those of temperature,Method,msa_2129228949
"Given a graph with billions of nodes and edges , how can we find patterns and anomalies ? Are there nodes that participate in too many or too few triangles ? Are there close-knit near-cliques ? These questions are expensive to answer unless we have the first several eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrix",Background,msa_2129898896
"However , eigensolvers suffer from subtle problems ( e",Purpose,msa_2129898896
", convergence ) for large sparse matrices , let alone for billion-scale ones",Purpose,msa_2129898896
We address this problem,Purpose,msa_2129898896
"with the proposed HEIGEN algorithm , which we carefully design to be accurate , efficient , and able to run on the highly scalable MAPREDUCE ( HADOOP ) environment",Mechanism,msa_2129898896

"We then applied these methods to populations of neurons recorded simultaneously in visual areas V1 and V2 ,",Method,msa_2143139396
and found that gLARA provides a better description of the recordings than pCCA,Findings,msa_2143139396
"We introduce and test the hypothesis that control over publication of private information may influence individuals privacy concerns and affect their propensity to disclose sensitive information , even when the objective risks associated with such disclosures do not change or worsen",Purpose,msa_2143953012
We designed three experiments in the form of online surveys administered to students at a North-American University,Method,msa_2143953012
"In all experiments we manipulated the participants control over information publication , but not their control over the actual access to and usage by others of the published information",Method,msa_2143953012
"Our findings suggest , paradoxically , that more control over the publication of their private information decreases individuals privacy concerns and increases their willingness to publish sensitive information , even when the probability that strangers will access and use that information stays the same or , in fact , increases",Findings,msa_2143953012
"On the other hand , less control over the publication of personal information increases individuals privacy concerns and decreases their willingness to publish sensitive information , even when the probability that strangers will access and use that information actually decreases",Findings,msa_2143953012
A large number of facility management tasks relying on sensor measurements require knowledge of the context under which the readings were collected,Background,msa_2143982228
"However , this context information ( i",Background,msa_2143982228
e,Background,msa_2143982228
"'spatial metadata ' ) is generally recorded manually , a process that is error-prone and time consuming considering the number of sensors located in a building",Background,msa_2143982228
"Therefore , as other researchers have pointed out , there is a need to automatically determine the location information",Background,msa_2143982228
Inferring the relative locations of sensors with respect to each other is arguably the first step to take and previous work in this area has already shown promising initial results,Purpose,msa_2143982228
"In this paper , we explore whether linear correlation or a statistical dependency measure ( in this case distance correlation ) are better suited to infer spatial relations between a pair of temperature sensors in a commercial building",Purpose,msa_2143982228
We conducted analyses on three different test beds where temperature measurements from 10 sensors were collected every minute,Method,msa_2143982228
We consider every possible size of data subsets within a year to explore time-windowing effects,Method,msa_2143982228
We also examine how different physical distances between sensors affect the results,Method,msa_2143982228
Most everyday electrical and electromechanical objects emit small amounts of electromagnetic ( EM ) noise during regular operation,Background,msa_2144299314
"When a user makes physical contact with such an object , this EM signal propagates through the user , owing to the conductivity of the human body",Purpose,msa_2144299314
"By modifying a small , low-cost , software-defined radio , we can detect and classify these signals in real-time , enabling robust on-touch object detection",Mechanism,msa_2144299314
"Unlike prior work , our approach requires no instrumentation of objects or the environment ; our sensor is self-contained and can be worn unobtrusively on the body",Mechanism,msa_2144299314
We call our technique EM-Sense and built a proof-of-concept smartwatch implementation,Mechanism,msa_2144299314

"Communication costs , resulting from synchronization requirements during learning , can greatly slow down many parallel machine learning algorithms",Purpose,msa_2145536610
"In this paper , we present a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm in which subsets of data are processed independently , with very little communication",Mechanism,msa_2145536610
"First , we arbitrarily partition data onto multiple machines",Mechanism,msa_2145536610
"Then , on each machine , any classical MCMC method ( e",Mechanism,msa_2145536610
", Gibbs sampling ) may be used to draw samples from a posterior distribution given the data subset",Mechanism,msa_2145536610
"Finally , the samples from each machine are combined to form samples from the full posterior",Mechanism,msa_2145536610
This embarrassingly parallel algorithm allows each machine to act independently on a subset of the data ( without communication ) until the final combination stage,Mechanism,msa_2145536610
We prove that our algorithm generates asymptotically exact samples and,Findings,msa_2145536610
empirically,Method,msa_2145536610
Stochastic gradient optimization is a class of widely used algorithms for training machine learning models,Background,msa_2145832734
"To optimize an objective , it uses the noisy gradient computed from the random data samples instead of the true gradient computed from the entire dataset",Background,msa_2145832734
"However , when the variance of the noisy gradient is large , the algorithm might spend much time bouncing around , leading to slower convergence and worse performance",Purpose,msa_2145832734
"In this paper , we develop a general approach of using control variate",Mechanism,msa_2145832734
for variance reduction in stochastic gradient,Purpose,msa_2145832734
Data statistics such as low-order moments ( pre-computed or estimated online ) is used to form the control variate,Mechanism,msa_2145832734
We demonstrate how to construct the control variate for two practical problems using stochastic gradient optimization,Method,msa_2145832734
"One is convexthe MAP estimation for logistic regression , and the other is non-convexstochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation",Method,msa_2145832734
"We propose Fast Generalized Subset Scan ( FGSS ) , a new method",Mechanism,msa_2146022760
for detecting anomalous patterns in general categorical data sets,Purpose,msa_2146022760
"We frame the pattern detection problem as a search over subsets of data records and attributes , maximizing a nonparametric scan statistic over all such subsets",Mechanism,msa_2146022760
"We prove that the nonparametric scan statistics possess a novel property that allows for efficient optimization over the exponentially many subsets of the data without an exhaustive search , enabling FGSS to scale to massive and high-dimensional data sets",Mechanism,msa_2146022760
"We evaluate the performance of FGSS in three real-world application domains ( customs monitoring , disease surveillance , and network intrusion detection ) ,",Method,msa_2146022760
and demonstrate that FGSS can successfully detect and characterize relevant patterns in each domain,Findings,msa_2146022760

"Paid crowd work offers remarkable opportunities for improving productivity , social mobility , and the global economy by engaging a geographically distributed workforce to complete complex tasks on demand and at scale",Background,msa_2146286563
"But it is also possible that crowd work will fail to achieve its potential , focusing on assembly-line piecework",Purpose,msa_2146286563
Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate ? This paper frames the major challenges that stand in the way of this goal,Purpose,msa_2146286563
"Drawing on theory from organizational behavior and distributed computing , as well as direct feedback from workers , we outline a framework",Mechanism,msa_2146286563

We consider the problem of adaptively routing a fleet of cooperative vehicles within a road network in the presence of uncertain and dynamic congestion conditions,Purpose,msa_2146333962
"To tackle this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2146333962
we first propose a Gaussian Process Dynamic Congestion Model that can effectively characterize both the dynamics and the uncertainty of congestion conditions,Mechanism,msa_2146333962
Our model is efficient and thus facilitates real-time adaptive routing in the face of uncertainty,Mechanism,msa_2146333962
"Using this congestion model , we develop an efficient algorithm for non-myopic adaptive routing",Mechanism,msa_2146333962
to minimize the collective travel time of all vehicles in the system,Purpose,msa_2146333962
"A key property of our approach is the ability to efficiently reason about the long-term value of exploration , which enables collectively balancing the exploration/exploitation trade-off for entire fleets of vehicles",Mechanism,msa_2146333962
We validate our approach based on traffic data from two large Asian cities,Method,msa_2146333962
We show that our congestion model is effective in modeling dynamic congestion conditions,Findings,msa_2146333962
"We also show that our routing algorithm generates significantly faster routes compared to standard baselines , and achieves near-optimal performance",Findings,msa_2146333962
compared to an omniscient routing algorithm,Method,msa_2146333962
We also present the results,Findings,msa_2146333962

The simple fact that human fingers are large and mobile devices are small has led to the perennial issue of limited surface area for touch-based interactive tasks,Purpose,msa_2146711757
"In response ,",Purpose,msa_2146711757
"we have developed Toffee , a sensing approach",Mechanism,msa_2146711757
that extends touch interaction beyond the small confines of a mobile device,Purpose,msa_2146711757
"and onto ad hoc adjacent surfaces , most notably tabletops",Mechanism,msa_2146711757
This is achieved using a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival ( TDOA ) correlation,Mechanism,msa_2146711757
Previous time-of-arrival based systems have required semi-permanent instrumentation of the surface and were too large for use in mobile devices,Mechanism,msa_2146711757
Our approach requires only a hard tabletop and gravity -- the latter acoustically couples mobile devices to surfaces,Mechanism,msa_2146711757
"We conducted an evaluation ,",Method,msa_2146711757

", a novel motion tracking technology",Purpose,msa_2147092109
that uses projected structured patterns and linear optical sensors,Mechanism,msa_2147092109
"Each sensor unit is capable of recovering 2D location within the projection area , while multiple sensors can be combined for up to six degree of freedom ( DOF ) tracking",Mechanism,msa_2147092109
"Our structured light approach is based on special patterns , called m-sequences , in which any consecutive sub-sequence of m bits is unique",Mechanism,msa_2147092109
"Lumitrack can utilize both digital and static projectors , as well as scalable embedded sensing configurations",Mechanism,msa_2147092109
"The resulting system enables high-speed , high precision , and low-cost motion tracking for a wide range of interactive applications",Mechanism,msa_2147092109

"There are many security tools and techniques for analyzing software , but many of them require access to source code",Background,msa_2147118954
"We propose leveraging decompilation , the study of recovering abstractions from compiled code ,",Mechanism,msa_2147118954
to apply existing source-based tools and techniques to compiled programs,Purpose,msa_2147118954
A decompiler should focus on two properties to be used for security,Background,msa_2147118954
"First , it should recover abstractions as much as possible to minimize the complexity that must be handled by the security analysis that follows",Background,msa_2147118954
"Second , it should aim to recover these abstractions correctly",Background,msa_2147118954
"Previous work in control-flow structuring , an abstraction recovery problem used in decompilers , does not provide either of these properties",Background,msa_2147118954
"Specifically , existing structuring algorithms are not semantics-preserving , which means that they can not safely be used for decompilation without modification",Purpose,msa_2147118954
Existing structural algorithms also miss opportunities for recovering control flow structure,Purpose,msa_2147118954
We propose a new structuring algorithm in this paper,Mechanism,msa_2147118954
that addresses these problems,Purpose,msa_2147118954

This is an important problem faced in many law-enforcement applications on almost a daily basis,Background,msa_2147514478

"A device just like Harry Potter 's Marauder 's Map , which pinpoints the location of each person-of-interest at all times , provides invaluable information for analysis of surveillance videos",Background,msa_2147736645
"To make this device real , a system would be required to perform robust person localization and tracking in real world surveillance scenarios , especially for complex indoor environments with many walls causing occlusion and long corridors with sparse surveillance camera coverage",Purpose,msa_2147736645
We propose a tracking-by-detection approach with nonnegative discretization to tackle this problem,Mechanism,msa_2147736645
"Given a set of person detection outputs , our framework takes advantage of all important cues such as color , person detection , face recognition and non-background information to perform tracking",Mechanism,msa_2147736645
Local learning approaches are used to uncover the manifold structure in the appearance space with spatio-temporal constraints,Mechanism,msa_2147736645

We develop a process modeling-based methodology,Mechanism,msa_2147841110

Our method focuses on the topological structure of a process and takes into account its effect on error propagation and risk mitigation using both expected loss and conditional value-at-risk risk measures,Mechanism,msa_2147841110
"Using this method , optimal strategies can be designed for control resource allocation to manage risk in a business process",Background,msa_2147841110

"Design , construction and operation of building heating , ventilation and air conditioning ( HVAC ) systems are complicated processes that generally involve several stakeholders , such as mechanical designers , control system integrators , commissioning agents and facilities managers",Background,msa_2148718741
It is important for all these stakeholders at various phases of the project to have a thorough understanding of the system components as well as the control strategy according to the design intent of the mechanical designers,Background,msa_2148718741
"For example , when assessing the behavior of a HVAC system during operation phase , it is important for facilities managers to check for the correctness of every components behavior and its control logic against the design specifications",Background,msa_2148718741
"The control sequences and logic of HVAC systems are primarily conveyed through schematic diagrams and textual descriptions called sequence of operations ( SOOs ) in construction documents ( ASHRAE , 2004 )",Purpose,msa_2148718741
Several challenges are associated with extracting and interpreting the information contained in these SOOs,Purpose,msa_2148718741
"Through a detailed analysis of a case-study conducted in relation to the information provided in the SOOs for the air handling unit ( AHU ) in a building , the research described in this paper highlights these challenges",Purpose,msa_2148718741
Stochastic variational inference finds good posterior approximations of probabilistic models with very large data sets,Background,msa_2148721460
"It optimizes the variational objective with stochastic optimization , following noisy estimates of the natural gradient",Background,msa_2148721460
"Operationally , stochastic inference iteratively subsamples from the data , analyzes the subsample , and updates parameters with a decreasing learning rate",Background,msa_2148721460
"However , the algorithm is sensitive to that rate , which usually requires hand-tuning to each application",Purpose,msa_2148721460
We solve this problem,Purpose,msa_2148721460

"Confessions are people 's way of coming clean , sharing unethical acts with others",Background,msa_2150562299
Although confessions are traditionally viewed as categorical one either comes clean or not people often confess to only part of their transgression,Background,msa_2150562299
"Such partial confessions may seem attractive , because they offer an opportunity to relieve ones guilt without having to own up to the full consequences of the transgression",Background,msa_2150562299
"In this paper , we explored the occurrence , antecedents , consequences , and everyday prevalence of partial confessions",Method,msa_2150562299
"Using a novel experimental design ,",Mechanism,msa_2150562299
"we found a high frequency of partial confessions , especially among people cheating to the full extent possible",Findings,msa_2150562299
People found partial confessions attractive because they ( correctly ) expected partial confessions to be more believable than not confessing,Findings,msa_2150562299
"People failed , however , to anticipate the emotional costs associated with partially confessing",Findings,msa_2150562299

The positive exemplars which exactly convey the precise semantic of an event are hard to obtain,Purpose,msa_2150979491
It would be beneficial to utilize the related exemplars for complex event detection,Purpose,msa_2150979491
"However , the semantic correlations between related exemplars and the target event vary substantially as relatedness assessment is subjective",Purpose,msa_2150979491

"While much of the work assessingT-cell spatiotemporal organization uses planar APC substitutes , wefocus here on B-cell APCs with often stark differences",Purpose,msa_2151083265
"Spatiotemporalsignaling distributions are driven by cell biologically distinct structures , a large protein assembly at the interface center , a large invagination , the actin-supported interface periphery as extended by smaller indi-vidual lamella , and a newly discovered whole-interface actin-drivenlamellum",Mechanism,msa_2151083265

"When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions , such as the expectation operator , we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes",Mechanism,msa_2158559550
"Furthermore , we present two concrete examples of RegBayes , infinite latent support vector machines ( iLSVM ) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines ( MT-iLSVM ) , which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning , respectively",Mechanism,msa_2158559550
We present efficient inference methods and,Mechanism,msa_2158559550
"report empirical studies on several benchmark data sets ,",Method,msa_2158559550
which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics,Findings,msa_2158559550
Network robustness is an important principle in biology and engineering,Background,msa_2159848460
Previous studies of global networks have identified both redundancy and sparseness as topological properties used by robust networks,Background,msa_2159848460
"By focusing on molecular subnetworks , or modules , we show that module topology is tightly linked to the level of environmental variability ( noise ) the module expects to encounter",Purpose,msa_2159848460
Modules internal to the cell that are less exposed to environmental noise are more connected and less robust than external modules,Background,msa_2159848460
A similar design principle is used by several other biological networks,Background,msa_2159848460
We propose a simple change to the evolutionary gene duplication model,Mechanism,msa_2159848460
which gives rise to the rich range of module topologies observed within real networks,Purpose,msa_2159848460
We apply these observations to evaluate and design communication networks that are specifically optimized for noisy or malicious environments,Method,msa_2159848460
"Combined , joint analysis of biological and computational networks",Method,msa_2159848460
The convergence of mobile computing and cloud computing enables new multimedia applications that are both resource-intensive and interaction-intensive,Background,msa_2159977093
"For these applications , end-to-end network bandwidth and latency matter greatly when cloud resources are used to augment the computational power and battery life of a mobile device",Background,msa_2159977093
We first present quantitative evidence,Method,msa_2159977093
that this crucial design consideration to meet interactive performance criteria limits data center consolidation,Purpose,msa_2159977093
We develop mini-batched parallel Frank-Wolfe ( conditional gradient ) methods,Mechanism,msa_2160570933
for smooth convex optimization subject to block-separable constraints,Purpose,msa_2160570933
Our work includes the basic ( batch ) Frank-Wolfe algorithm as well as the recently proposed Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe ( BCFW ) method\citep { lacoste2012block } as special cases,Mechanism,msa_2160570933
"Our algorithm permits asynchronous updates within the minibatch , and is robust to stragglers and faulty worker threads",Mechanism,msa_2160570933
Our analysis reveals how the potential speedups over BCFW depend on the minibatch size and how one can provably obtain large problem dependent speedups,Findings,msa_2160570933

"How can we tell when accounts are fake or real in a social network ? And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal , conservative or centrist users ? Often , we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily ( `` birds of a feather flock together '' ) or heterophily ( `` opposites attract '' )",Background,msa_2162150749
One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation ( BP ) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence,Background,msa_2162150749
"A well-known problem with BP , however , is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops",Purpose,msa_2162150749
"This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation ( LinBP ) , a linearization of BP",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
that allows a closed-form solution,Purpose,msa_2162150749
"via intuitive matrix equations and , thus , comes with exact convergence guarantees",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
"It handles homophily , heterophily , and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
"Plus , it allows a compact implementation in SQL",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
"The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation ( SBP ) , a localized ( or `` myopic '' ) version of LinBP",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
that propagates information across every edge at most once,Purpose,msa_2162150749
and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors,Mechanism,msa_2162150749
"In addition , SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks",Mechanism,msa_2162150749
Our runtime experiments,Method,msa_2162150749
We propose a dynamic topic model,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
for monitoring temporal evolution of market competition,Purpose,msa_2162683784
by jointly leveraging tweets and their associated images,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
For a market of interest ( e,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
g,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"luxury goods ) , we aim at automatically detecting the latent topics ( e",Mechanism,msa_2162683784
g,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"bags , clothes , luxurious ) that are competitively shared by multiple brands ( e",Mechanism,msa_2162683784
g,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"Burberry , Prada , and Chanel ) , and tracking temporal evolution of the brands ' stakes over the shared topics",Mechanism,msa_2162683784
One of key applications of our work is social media monitoring that can provide companies with temporal summaries of highly overlapped or discriminative topics with their major competitors,Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"We design our model to correctly address three major challenges : multiview representation of text and images , modeling of competitiveness of multiple brands over shared topics , and tracking their temporal evolution",Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"As far as we know , no previous model can satisfy all the three challenges",Mechanism,msa_2162683784
"For evaluation , we analyze about 10 millions of tweets and 8 millions of associated images of the 23 brands in the two categories of luxury and beer",Method,msa_2162683784
"Through experiments ,",Method,msa_2162683784
we show that the proposed approach is more successful than other candidate methods for the topic modeling of competition,Findings,msa_2162683784

The stochastic matching problem deals with finding a maximum matching in a graph whose edges are unknown but can be accessed via queries,Purpose,msa_2162740996
"This is a special case of stochastic k-set packing , where the problem is to find a maximum packing of sets , each of which exists with some probability",Purpose,msa_2162740996
"In this paper , we provide edge and set query algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2162740996
"for these two problems , respectively ,",Purpose,msa_2162740996
that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimal solution,Mechanism,msa_2162740996
Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching ( i,Mechanism,msa_2162740996
", 2-set packing ) problem is the design of an adaptive algorithm that queries only a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a ( 1-e ) fraction of the omniscient optimal solution , for an arbitrarily small e > 0",Mechanism,msa_2162740996
"Moreover , this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only a constant number of rounds",Mechanism,msa_2162740996
We complement this result with a non-adaptive ( i,Mechanism,msa_2162740996
", one round of queries ) algorithm that achieves a ( 0",Mechanism,msa_2162740996
5 - e ) fraction of the omniscient optimum,Mechanism,msa_2162740996
"We also extend both our results to stochastic k-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a ( 2/k - e ) fraction of the omniscient optimal solution , again with only O ( 1 ) queries per element",Mechanism,msa_2162740996
This guarantee is close to the best known polynomial-time approximation ratio of 3/k+1 -e for the deterministic k-set packing problem [ Furer 2013 ],Mechanism,msa_2162740996
"We empirically explore the application of ( adaptations of ) these algorithms to the kidney exchange problem , where patients with end-stage renal failure swap willing but incompatible donors",Method,msa_2162740996

Undirected graphical models are important in a number of modern applications that involve exploring or exploiting dependency structures underlying the data,Background,msa_2162926179
"For example , they are often used to explore complex systems where connections between entities are not well understood , such as in functional brain networks or genetic networks",Background,msa_2162926179
"Existing methods for estimating structure of undirected graphical models focus on scenarios where each node represents a scalar random variable , such as a binary neural activation state or a continuous mRNA abundance measurement , even though in many real world problems , nodes can represent multivariate variables with much richer meanings , such as whole images , text documents , or multi-view feature vectors",Purpose,msa_2162926179
"In this paper , we propose a new principled framework",Mechanism,msa_2162926179
for estimating the structure of undirected graphical models from such multivariate ( or multi-attribute ) nodal data,Purpose,msa_2162926179
The structure of a graph is inferred through estimation of non-zero partial canonical correlation between nodes,Mechanism,msa_2162926179
"Under a Gaussian model , this strategy is equivalent to estimating conditional independencies between random vectors represented by the nodes and it generalizes the classical problem of covariance selection ( Dempster , 1972 )",Mechanism,msa_2162926179
We relate the problem of estimating non-zero partial canonical correlations to maximizing a penalized Gaussian likelihood objective and develop a method that efficiently maximizes this objective,Mechanism,msa_2162926179
Extensive simulation studies,Method,msa_2162926179
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method under various conditions,Findings,msa_2162926179
Many large-scale machine learning ( ML ) applications use iterative algorithms to converge on parameter values that make the chosen model fit the input data,Background,msa_2162970483
"Often , this approach results in the same sequence of accesses to parameters repeating each iteration",Purpose,msa_2162970483
This paper shows that these repeating patterns can and should be exploited,Mechanism,msa_2162970483
to improve the efficiency of the parallel and distributed ML applications that will be a mainstay in cloud computing environments,Purpose,msa_2162970483
"Focusing on the increasingly popular `` parameter server '' approach to sharing model parameters among worker threads , we describe and demonstrate how the repeating patterns can be exploited",Mechanism,msa_2162970483
"Examples include replacing dynamic cache and server structures with static pre-serialized structures , informing prefetch and partitioning decisions , and determining which data should be cached at each thread to avoid both contention and slow accesses to memory banks attached to other sockets",Mechanism,msa_2162970483
Experiments,Method,msa_2162970483
Dashboards are increasingly being used in commercial buildings to show building data in an intuitive way to occupants and facility operators,Background,msa_2163102740
"Such dashboards make relevant parties aware of the impact that they have on a buildings behavior and enable them to understand the dynamics of building systems and current/historical energy use , and as a result , support reduction in energy use and improvement of operations of such systems",Background,msa_2163102740
This paper gives an overview of an approach,Mechanism,msa_2163102740
for designing and implementing an energy dashboard,Purpose,msa_2163102740

Many modern multi-core processors sport a large shared cache with the primary goal of enhancing the statistic performance of computing workloads,Background,msa_2163283745
"However , due to resulting cache interference among tasks , the uncontrolled use of such a shared cache can significantly hamper the predictability and analyzability of multi-core real-time systems",Background,msa_2163283745
Software cache partitioning has been considered as an attractive approach to address this issue because it does not require any hardware support beyond that available on many modern processors,Background,msa_2163283745
"However , the state-of-the-art software cache partitioning techniques face two challenges : ( 1 ) the memory co-partitioning problem , which results in page swapping or waste of memory , and ( 2 ) the availability of a limited number of cache partitions , which causes degraded performance",Purpose,msa_2163283745
These are major impediments to the practical adoption of software cache partitioning,Purpose,msa_2163283745
"In this paper , we propose a practical OS-level cache management scheme",Mechanism,msa_2163283745
for multi-core real-time systems,Purpose,msa_2163283745
"Our scheme provides predictable cache performance , addresses the aforementioned problems of existing software cache partitioning , and efficiently allocates cache partitions to schedule a given task set",Mechanism,msa_2163283745
We have implemented and evaluated our scheme in Linux/RK running on the Intel Core i7 quad-core processor,Method,msa_2163283745
Experimental,Method,msa_2163283745
Existing algorithms for trajectory-based clustering usually rely on simplex representation and a single proximity-related distance ( or similarity ) measure,Background,msa_2163347789
"Consequently , additional information markers ( e",Background,msa_2163347789
", social interactions or the semantics of the spatial layout ) are usually ignored , leading to the inability to fully discover the communities in the trajectory database",Background,msa_2163347789
"This is especially true for human-generated trajectories , where additional fine-grained markers ( e",Purpose,msa_2163347789
", movement velocity at certain locations , or the sequence of semantic spaces visited ) can help capture latent relationships between cluster members",Purpose,msa_2163347789
"To address this limitation ,",Purpose,msa_2163347789
we propose TODMIS : a general framework for Trajectory cOmmunity Discovery using Multiple Information Sources,Mechanism,msa_2163347789
TODMIS combines additional information with raw trajectory data and creates multiple similarity metrics,Mechanism,msa_2163347789
"In our proposed approach , we first develop a novel approach",Mechanism,msa_2163347789
for computing semantic level similarity,Purpose,msa_2163347789
"by constructing a Markov Random Walk model from the semantically-labeled trajectory data , and then measuring similarity at the distribution level",Mechanism,msa_2163347789
"In addition , we also extract and compute pair-wise similarity measures related to three additional markers , namely trajectory level spatial alignment ( proximity ) , temporal patterns and multi-scale velocity statistics",Mechanism,msa_2163347789
"Finally , after creating a single similarity metric from the weighted combination of these multiple measures , we apply dense sub-graph detection",Mechanism,msa_2163347789
to discover the set of distinct communities,Purpose,msa_2163347789
"We evaluated TODMIS extensively using traces of ( i ) student movement data in a campus , ( ii ) customer trajectories in a shopping mall , and ( iii ) city-scale taxi movement data",Method,msa_2163347789

"Despite decades of research attempting to establish conversational interaction between humans and computers , the capabilities of automated conversational systems are still limited",Purpose,msa_2163986367
"In this paper , we introduce Chorus , a crowd-powered conversational assistant",Mechanism,msa_2163986367
"When using Chorus , end users converse continuously with what appears to be a single conversational partner",Mechanism,msa_2163986367
"Behind the scenes , Chorus leverages multiple crowd workers to propose and vote on responses",Mechanism,msa_2163986367
"A shared memory space helps the dynamic crowd workforce maintain consistency , and a game-theoretic incentive mechanism helps to balance their efforts between proposing and voting",Mechanism,msa_2163986367
Studies with 12 end users and 100 crowd workers,Method,msa_2163986367
"demonstrate that Chorus can provide accurate , topical responses , answering nearly 93 % of user queries appropriately , and staying on-topic in over 95 % of responses",Findings,msa_2163986367
"We also observed that Chorus has advantages over pairing an end user with a single crowd worker and end users completing their own tasks in terms of speed , quality , and breadth of assistance",Findings,msa_2163986367
Organizations that collect and use large volumes of personal information often use security audits to protect data subjects from inappropriate uses of this information by authorized insiders,Background,msa_2164245297
"In face of unknown incentives of employees , a reasonable audit strategy for the organization is one that minimizes its regret",Background,msa_2164245297
"While regret minimization has been extensively studied in repeated games , the standard notion of regret for repeated games can not capture the complexity of the interaction between the organization ( defender ) and an adversary , which arises from dependence of rewards and actions on history",Purpose,msa_2164245297
"To account for this generality ,",Purpose,msa_2164245297
"we introduce a richer class of games called bounded-memory games ,",Mechanism,msa_2164245297
which can provide a more accurate model of the audit process,Purpose,msa_2164245297
"We introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret , which compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the algorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained by the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary",Mechanism,msa_2164245297
"Roughly , a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender 's actions exactly as the real adversary would within each window of karounds",Mechanism,msa_2164245297
A k-adaptive adversary is a natural model for temporary adversaries ( e,Mechanism,msa_2164245297
", company employees ) who stay for a certain number of audit cycles and are then replaced by a different person",Mechanism,msa_2164245297
"Our definition is parameterized by a set of experts , which can include both fixed and adaptive defender strategies",Mechanism,msa_2164245297
We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive regret minimization in bounded-memory games of perfect and imperfect information,Mechanism,msa_2164245297

"Two assembly strategiesa whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assemblywere used , each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort",Mechanism,msa_2165460636
The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2,Mechanism,msa_2165460636
"9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced , without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group",Mechanism,msa_2165460636

11-fold coverage,Findings,msa_2165460636
The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data,Findings,msa_2165460636
The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes,Findings,msa_2165460636
"More than 90 % of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more , and 25 % of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger",Findings,msa_2165460636
"Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence",Findings,msa_2165460636
"Although gene-dense clusters are obvious , almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence",Findings,msa_2165460636
Only 1,Findings,msa_2165460636

1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ),Findings,msa_2165460636
"A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average , but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome",Findings,msa_2165460636
"Less than 1 % of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins ,",Findings,msa_2165460636
Developments in health information technology have encouraged the establishment of distributed systems known as Health Information Exchanges ( HIEs ) to enable the sharing of patient records between institutions,Background,msa_2166707323
"In many cases , the parties running these exchanges wish to limit the amount of information they are responsible for holding because of sensitivities about patient information",Background,msa_2166707323
"Hence , there is an interest in broker-based HIEs that keep limited information in the exchange repositories",Background,msa_2166707323
"However , it is essential to audit these exchanges carefully due to risks of inappropriate data sharing",Purpose,msa_2166707323
"In this paper , we consider some of the requirements and present a design",Mechanism,msa_2166707323
for auditing broker-based HIEs,Purpose,msa_2166707323
in a way that controls the information available in audit logs and regulates their release for investigations,Mechanism,msa_2166707323
Our approach is based on formal rules for audit and the use of Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption ( HIBE ) to support staged release of data needed in audits and a balance between automated and manual reviews,Mechanism,msa_2166707323
"We introduce scalable deep kernels , which combine the structural properties of deep learning architectures with the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods",Mechanism,msa_2167085024
"Specifically , we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture , using local kernel interpolation , inducing points , and structure exploiting ( Kronecker and Toeplitz ) algebra for a scalable kernel representation",Mechanism,msa_2167085024
"These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels , with benefits in expressive power and scalability",Purpose,msa_2167085024
We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process,Mechanism,msa_2167085024
"Inference and learning cost $ O ( n ) $ for $ n $ training points , and predictions cost $ O ( 1 ) $ per test point",Mechanism,msa_2167085024

reduction of energy consumption ),Background,msa_2167549098
"As sensor networks in buildings increase , the complexity of managing them also increases",Background,msa_2167549098
"For instance , the generation and maintenance of metadata about sensors , such as their location within a building , currently requires significant manual labor",Background,msa_2167549098
"The research described in this paper explores the relationship between different HVAC system sensor measurements and physical characteristics of spaces , and its potential application in streamlining the identification of sensor location within a facility",Purpose,msa_2167549098
The energy contained in the conditioned air delivered to each room is presented as a characteristic feature in order to understand the differences between rooms,Method,msa_2167549098
"Being able to understand the relationships between different measurement types and building characteristics is fundamental in achieving an automatic mapping of sensors in buildings ,",Background,msa_2167549098
"Given a large dataset of users ' ratings of movies , what is the best model to accurately predict which movies a person will like ? And how can we prevent spammers from tricking our algorithms into suggesting a bad movie ? Is it possible to infer structure between movies simultaneously ?",Purpose,msa_2167564468
In this paper we describe a unified Bayesian approach to Collaborative Filtering,Mechanism,msa_2167564468
that accomplishes all of these goals,Purpose,msa_2167564468
It models the discrete structure of ratings and is flexible to the often non-Gaussian shape of the distribution,Mechanism,msa_2167564468
"Additionally , our method finds a co-clustering of the users and items , which improves the model 's accuracy and makes the model robust to fraud",Mechanism,msa_2167564468
"We offer three main contributions : ( 1 ) We provide a novel model and Gibbs sampling algorithm that accurately models the quirks of real world ratings , such as convex ratings distributions",Mechanism,msa_2167564468

"We address the problem of model checking stochastic systems , i",Purpose,msa_2168798915
", checking whether a stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal property with a probability greater ( or smaller ) than a fixed threshold",Purpose,msa_2168798915
"In particular , we present a Statistical Model Checking ( SMC ) approach based on Bayesian statistics",Mechanism,msa_2168798915
"We show that our approach is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions , a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models",Mechanism,msa_2168798915
Standard approaches to stochastic discrete systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces,Background,msa_2168798915
Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging,Background,msa_2168798915
The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case,Mechanism,msa_2168798915
It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces ( which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow ) with hypothesis testing ( i,Mechanism,msa_2168798915
", testing against a probability threshold ) or estimation ( i",Mechanism,msa_2168798915
", computing with high probability a value close to the true probability )",Mechanism,msa_2168798915
We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models,Mechanism,msa_2168798915
"While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct , we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small",Findings,msa_2168798915
"The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard , exhaustive model checking techniques",Mechanism,msa_2168798915
We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink : a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance,Method,msa_2168798915
We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques,Findings,msa_2168798915
We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models,Mechanism,msa_2168798915
We consider distributed optimization in random networks where N nodes cooperatively minimize the sum i=1 N f i ( x ) of their individual convex costs,Purpose,msa_2168803043
"Existing literature proposes distributed gradient-like methods that are computationally cheap and resilient to link failures , but have slow convergence rates",Background,msa_2168803043
"In this paper , we propose accelerated distributed gradient methods that 1 ) are resilient to link failures ; 2 ) computationally cheap ; and 3 ) improve convergence rates over other gradient methods",Mechanism,msa_2168803043
"We model the network by a sequence of independent , identically distributed random matrices { W ( k ) } drawn from the set of symmetric , stochastic matrices with positive diagonals",Mechanism,msa_2168803043
"The network is connected on average and the cost functions are convex , differentiable , with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients",Mechanism,msa_2168803043
We design two distributed Nesterov-like gradient methods that modify the D-NG and D-NC methods that we proposed for static networks,Mechanism,msa_2168803043
We prove their convergence rates,Findings,msa_2168803043
in terms of the expected optimality gap at the cost function,Method,msa_2168803043
"Let k and K be the number of per-node gradient evaluations and per-node communications , respectively",Method,msa_2168803043
"Then the modified D-NG achieves rates O ( logk/k ) and O ( logK/ K ) , and the modified D-NC rates O ( 1/k 2 ) and O ( 1/ K 2- ) , where > 0 is arbitrarily small",Findings,msa_2168803043
"For comparison , the standard distributed gradient method can not do better than ( 1/k 2/3 ) and ( 1/ K 2/3 ) , on the same class of cost functions ( even for static networks )",Background,msa_2168803043

We propose a model,Mechanism,msa_2173294139
to learn visually grounded word embeddings ( vis-w2v ) to capture visual notions of semantic relatedness,Purpose,msa_2173294139
"While word embeddings trained using text have been extremely successful , they can not uncover notions of semantic relatedness implicit in our visual world",Purpose,msa_2173294139
"For instance , although `` eats '' and `` stares at '' seem unrelated in text , they share semantics visually",Background,msa_2173294139
"When people are eating something , they also tend to stare at the food",Background,msa_2173294139
"Grounding diverse relations like `` eats '' and `` stares at '' into vision remains challenging , despite recent progress in vision",Purpose,msa_2173294139

"Review fraud is a pervasive problem in online commerce , in which fraudulent sellers write or purchase fake reviews to manipulate perception of their products and services",Background,msa_2174402890
"Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs , including 1 ) they occur in short bursts of time ; 2 ) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions",Purpose,msa_2174402890
"However , these may both be true in any given dataset",Purpose,msa_2174402890
"Hence , in this paper , we propose an approach",Mechanism,msa_2174402890

Health information exchanges ( HIEs ) are healthcare information technology efforts designed to foster coordination of patient care across the fragmented U,Background,msa_2176928290
healthcare system,Background,msa_2176928290
Their purpose is to improve efficiency and quality of care through enhanced sharing of patient data,Background,msa_2176928290
"Across the United States , numerous states have enacted laws that provide various forms of incentives for HIEs and address growing privacy concerns associated with the sharing of patient data",Background,msa_2176928290
"We investigate the impact on the emergence of HIEs of state laws that incentivize HIE efforts and state laws that include different types of privacy requirements for sharing healthcare data ,",Purpose,msa_2176928290
focusing on the impact of laws that include requirements for patient consent,Method,msa_2176928290
"Although we observe that privacy regulation alone can result in a decrease in planning and operational HIEs , we also find that , when coupled with incentives , privacy regulation with requirements for patient consent can actually positively impact the development of HIE efforts",Findings,msa_2176928290
"Among all states with laws creating HIE incentives , only states that combined incentives with consent requirements saw a net increase in operational HIEs ; HIEs in those states also reported decreased levels of privacy concern relative to HIEs in states with other legislative approaches",Findings,msa_2176928290

"based on machine learning ( ML ) and mixed-integer programming ( MIP ) ,",Mechanism,msa_2178355895
focusing on prediction of diagnosis-related groups ( DRGs ) and the use of these predictions for allocating scarce hospital resources,Purpose,msa_2178355895
"DRGs are a payment scheme employed at patients discharge , where the DRG and length of stay determine the revenue that the hospital obtains",Background,msa_2178355895
"We show that early and accurate DRG classification using ML methods , incorporated into an MIP-based resource allocation model , can increase the hospitals contribution margin , the number of admitted patients , and the utilization of resources such as operating rooms and beds",Mechanism,msa_2178355895

Background Effective management and treatment of cancer continues to be complicated by the rapid evolution and resulting heterogeneity of tumors,Background,msa_2179754069
Phylogenetic study of cell populations in single tumors provides a way to delineate intra-tumoral heterogeneity and identify robust features of evolutionary processes,Background,msa_2179754069
"The introduction of single-cell sequencing has shown great promise for advancing single-tumor phylogenetics ; however , the volume and high noise in these data present challenges for inference , especially with regard to chromosome abnormalities that typically dominate tumor evolution",Purpose,msa_2179754069
"Here , we investigate a strategy",Mechanism,msa_2179754069
"When training large machine learning models with many variables or parameters , a single machine is often inadequate since the model may be too large to fit in memory , while training can take a long time even with stochastic updates",Background,msa_2182420680
"A natural recourse is to turn to distributed cluster computing , in order to harness additional memory and processors",Background,msa_2182420680

This so-called differential radical characterization re- lies on a sound abstraction of the reachable set of solutions by the smallest variety that contains it,Mechanism,msa_2182451272
"The characterization leads to a differential radical invariant proof rule that is sound and complete , which implies that invariance of algebraic equa- tions over real-closed fields is decidable",Mechanism,msa_2182451272
"Furthermore , the problem of generating invariant varieties is shown to be as hard as minimizing the rank of a symbolic matrix , and is therefore NP-hard",Mechanism,msa_2182451272

"When companies operate on the graphs with monetary incentives to sell Twitter `` Followers '' and Facebook page `` Likes '' , the graphs show strange connectivity patterns",Background,msa_2182891243

33 billion edges,Method,msa_2182891243
We report strange deviations from typical patterns like smooth degree distributions,Findings,msa_2182891243
We find that such deviations are often due to `` lockstep behavior '' that large groups of followers connect to the same groups of followees,Findings,msa_2182891243
Our first contribution is that we study strange patterns on the adjacency matrix and in the spectral subspaces with respect to several flavors of lockstep,Method,msa_2182891243

We constructed the system using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy images from the Human Protein Atlas project for 11 punctate proteins in three cultured cell lines,Mechanism,msa_2183629688
"These proteins have previously been characterized as being primarily located in punctate structures , but their images had all been annotated by visual examination as being simply vesicular",Mechanism,msa_2183629688
"We were able to show that these patterns could be distinguished from each other with high accuracy , and we were able to assign to one of these subclasses hundreds of proteins whose subcellular localization had not previously been well defined",Findings,msa_2183629688

Revenue maximization in combinatorial auctions ( and other multidimensional selling settings ) is one of the most important and elusive problems in mechanism design,Background,msa_2183891261
"The optimal design is unknown , and is known to include features that are not acceptable in many applications , such as favoring some bidders over others and randomization",Purpose,msa_2183891261
"In this paper , we instead study a common revenue-enhancement approach - bundling - in the context of the most commonly studied combinatorial auction mechanism , the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves ( VCG ) mechanism",Mechanism,msa_2183891261
A second challenge in mechanism design for combinatorial auctions is that the prior distribution on each bidder 's valuation can be doubly exponential,Purpose,msa_2183891261
Such priors do not exist in most applications,Background,msa_2183891261
"Rather , in many applications ( such as premium display advertising markets ) , there is essentially a point prior , which may not be accurate",Background,msa_2183891261
"We adopt the point prior model , and prove robustness to inaccuracy in the prior",Mechanism,msa_2183891261

We propose a novel content driven pooling that leverages space-time context while being robust toward global space-time transformations,Mechanism,msa_2184450955
Being robust to such transformations is of primary importance in unconstrained videos where the action localizations can drastically shift between frames,Mechanism,msa_2184450955
Our pooling identifies regions of interest using video structural cues estimated by different saliency functions,Mechanism,msa_2184450955

"Given a large graph , like a computer communication network , which $ k $ nodes should we immunize ( or monitor , or remove ) , to make it as robust as possible against a computer virus attack ? This problem , referred to as the node immunization problem , is the core building block in many high-impact applications , ranging from public health , cybersecurity to viral marketing",Background,msa_2185894252
A central component in node immunization is to find the best $ k $ bridges of a given graph,Background,msa_2185894252

"First of all , we propose a novel bridging score $ \Delta \lambda $ , inspired by immunology , and we show that its results agree with intuition for several realistic settings",Mechanism,msa_2185894252
"Since the straightforward way to compute $ \Delta \lambda $ is computationally intractable , we then focus on the computational issues and propose a surprisingly efficient way ( $ O ( nk^2+m ) $ ) to estimate it",Mechanism,msa_2185894252

"Influence maximization is a problem of maximizing the aggregate adoption of products , technologies , or even beliefs",Background,msa_2187609645
Most past algorithms leveraged an assumption of submodularity that captures diminishing returns to scale,Background,msa_2187609645
"While submodularity is natural in many domains , early stages of innovation adoption are often better characterized by convexity , which is evident for renewable technologies , such as rooftop solar",Purpose,msa_2187609645
We formulate a dynamic influence maximization problem under increasing returns,Mechanism,msa_2187609645

"Pareto efficiency is a widely used property in solution concepts for cooperative and non -- cooperative game -- theoretic settings and , more generally , in multi -- objective problems",Background,msa_2189111859
"However , finding or even approximating ( when the objective functions are not convex ) the Pareto curve is hard",Purpose,msa_2189111859
Most of the literature focuses on computing concise representations to approximate the Pareto curve or on exploiting evolutionary approaches to generate approximately Pareto efficient samples of the curve,Purpose,msa_2189111859

Extensive-form games are a powerful tool for modeling a large range of multiagent scenarios,Background,msa_2189215284

"When the error is monotonically increasing in distance to nearest discrete point , we develop an integer program for finding the optimal discretization when the error is described by piecewise linear functions",Mechanism,msa_2189215284

"Kidney exchange , where candidates with organ failure trade incompatible but willing donors , is a life-saving alternative to the deceased donor waitlist , which has inadequate supply to meet demand",Background,msa_2193348535
"While fielded kidney exchanges see huge benefit from altruistic kidney donors ( who give an organ without a paired needy candidate ) , a significantly higher medical risk to the donor deters similar altruism with livers",Purpose,msa_2193348535
"In this paper , we begin by proposing the idea of liver exchange , and show on demographically accurate data that vetted kidney exchange algorithms can be adapted to clear such an exchange at the nationwide level",Mechanism,msa_2193348535
We then explore cross-organ donation where kidneys and livers can be bartered for each other,Mechanism,msa_2193348535
We show theoretically that this multi-organ exchange provides linearly more transplants than running separate kidney and liver exchanges ; this linear gain is a product of altruistic kidney donors creating chains that thread through the liver pool,Mechanism,msa_2193348535
We support this result experimentally on demographically accurate multi-organ exchanges,Method,msa_2193348535
The human brain is widely hypothesized to construct inner beliefs about how the world works,Background,msa_2195367229
It is thought that we need this conception to coordinate our movements and anticipate rapid events that go on around us,Background,msa_2195367229
"A driver , for example , needs to predict how the car should behave in response to every turn of the steering wheel and every tap on the brake",Background,msa_2195367229
"But on icy roads , these predictions will often not reflect how the car would behave",Background,msa_2195367229
Applying the brakes sharply in these conditions could send the car skidding uncontrollably rather than stopping,Background,msa_2195367229
"In general , a mismatch between ones inner beliefs and reality is thought to cause errors and accidents",Purpose,msa_2195367229

Golub et al,Purpose,msa_2195367229
investigated this hypothesis,Purpose,msa_2195367229
by conducting a brain-machine interface experiment,Method,msa_2195367229
"In this experiment , neural signals from the brains of two rhesus macaques were recorded using arrays of electrodes and translated into movements of a cursor on a computer screen",Method,msa_2195367229
The monkeys were then trained to mentally move the cursor to hit targets on the screen,Method,msa_2195367229
The monkeys cursor movements were remarkably precise,Findings,msa_2195367229
"In fact , the experiment showed that the monkeys could internally predict their cursor movements just as a driver predicts how a car will move when turning the steering wheel",Findings,msa_2195367229
"These findings indicate that the monkeys have likely developed inner beliefs to predict how their neural signals drive the cursor , and that these beliefs helped coordinate their performance",Findings,msa_2195367229
"In addition , when the monkeys did make mistakes , their neural signals were not entirely wrongin fact they were typically consistent with the monkeys inner beliefs about how the cursor moves",Findings,msa_2195367229
A mismatch between these inner beliefs and reality explained most of the monkeys mistakes,Findings,msa_2195367229
The brain constructs such inner beliefs over time through experience and learning,Background,msa_2195367229
"To study this learning process , Golub et al",Purpose,msa_2195367229
next conducted an experiment in which the cursor moved in a way that was substantially different from the monkeys inner beliefs,Method,msa_2195367229

"Due to the dramatic growth of volume and complexity of data , several new challenges have emerged and can not be effectively addressed by existing LVMs : ( 1 ) How to capture long-tail patterns that carry crucial information when the popularity of patterns is distributed in a power-law fashion ? ( 2 ) How to reduce model complexity and computational cost without compromising the modeling power of LVMs ? ( 3 ) How to improve the interpretability and reduce the redundancy of discovered patterns ? To addresses the three challenges discussed above",Purpose,msa_2200914098
", we develop a novel regularization technique for LVMs , which controls the geometry of the latent space during learning to enable the learned latent components of LVMs to be diverse in the sense that they are favored to be mutually different from each other , to accomplish long-tail coverage , low redundancy , and better interpretability",Mechanism,msa_2200914098
We propose a mutual angular regularizer ( MAR ) to encourage the components in LVMs to have larger mutual angles,Mechanism,msa_2200914098
"The MAR is non-convex and non-smooth , entailing great challenges for optimization",Mechanism,msa_2200914098
"To cope with this issue , we derive a smooth lower bound of the MAR and optimize the lower bound instead",Mechanism,msa_2200914098
We show that the monotonicity of the lower bound is closely aligned with the MAR to qualify the lower bound as a desirable surrogate of the MAR,Findings,msa_2200914098

The Pokerface is a two-phase approach,Mechanism,msa_2203400881
"It first aims at maximizing the minimum gap between adjacently-valued pixels while keeping the partial ordering of the pixels in the face image under extreme illumination condition , an intuitive effort based on order theory to unveil the underlying structure of a dark image",Mechanism,msa_2203400881
This optimization can be formulated as a feasibility search problem and can be efficiently solved by linear programming,Mechanism,msa_2203400881

Content-based medical image retrieval ( CBMIR ) is an active research area for disease diagnosis and treatment but it can be problematic given the small visual variations between anatomical structures,Purpose,msa_2203738484
We propose a retrieval method based on a bag-of-visual-words ( BoVW ) to identify discriminative characteristics between different medical images with Pruned Dictionary based on Latent Semantic Topic description,Mechanism,msa_2203738484
We refer to this as the PD-LST retrieval,Mechanism,msa_2203738484
Our method has two main components,Mechanism,msa_2203738484
"First , we calculate a topic-word significance value for each visual word given a certain latent topic to evaluate how the word is connected to this latent topic",Mechanism,msa_2203738484
"The latent topics are learnt , based on the relationship between the images and words , and are employed to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics",Mechanism,msa_2203738484
These latent topics describe the images and words semantically and can thus facilitate more meaningful comparisons between the words,Mechanism,msa_2203738484

"Finally , we introduce a family of post-processing techniques that outperform prior ones",Mechanism,msa_2212088069
"We applied these techniques to generate an agent for two-player no-limit Texas Hold'em , called Tartanian7 ,",Method,msa_2212088069
"In this paper , we propose a novel joint formulation of feature-based active contour ( FAC ) and prior shape constraints ( CS )",Mechanism,msa_2212199686
for lips/mouth segmentation in the wild,Purpose,msa_2212199686
Our proposed SC-FAC model is able to robustly segment the lips/mouth that belongs to a given mouth shape space while minimizing the energy functional,Mechanism,msa_2212199686
The shape space is defined by a 2D Modified Active Shape Model ( MASM ) whereas the active contour model is based on the Chan-Vese functional,Mechanism,msa_2212199686
Our SC-FAC energy functional is able to overcome the drawback of noise while minimizing the fitting forces under the shape constraints,Mechanism,msa_2212199686
"We conducted our experiments on images captured under challenging conditions such as varying illumination , low contrast , facial expression , low resolution , blurring , wearing beard/moustache and cosmetic affection from the MBGC , VidTIMIT , JAFFE , and LFW databases",Method,msa_2212199686
The results from our studies indicate that the proposed SC-FAC model is reliable and accurately perform prior shape weak object segmentation,Findings,msa_2212199686
"The average performance of the mouth segmentation using proposed SC-FAC on 1918 images from the MBGC database under different illuminations , expressions , and complex background reaches to a Precision of 91",Findings,msa_2212199686

Bayesian theory has provided a compelling conceptualization for perceptual inference in the brain,Background,msa_2212211360
Central to Bayesian inference is the notion of statistical priors,Background,msa_2212211360
"To understand the neural mechanisms of Bayesian inference , we need to understand the neural representation of statistical regularities in the natural environment",Background,msa_2212211360
"In this paper , we investigated empirically how statistical regularities in natural 3D scenes are represented in the functional connectivity of disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex of primates",Purpose,msa_2212211360
We applied,Method,msa_2212211360
a Boltzmann machine model,Mechanism,msa_2212211360
"to learn from 3D natural scenes ,",Purpose,msa_2212211360
"and found that the units in the model exhibited cooperative and competitive interactions , forming a disparity association field , analogous to the contour association field",Findings,msa_2212211360
The cooperative and competitive interactions in the disparity association field are consistent with constraints of computational models for stereo matching,Findings,msa_2212211360
"In addition , we simulated neurophysiological experiments on the model ,",Method,msa_2212211360
and found the results to be consistent with neurophysiological data in terms of the functional connectivity measurements between disparity-tuned neurons in the macaque primary visual cortex,Findings,msa_2212211360
AbstractEngineering analysis to quantify the effects of earthquake forces on the structural strength of components requires determining the damage mode and severity of the components,Background,msa_2213682550
"The analysis requires strength computations and visual damage assessments , which are information intensive , potentially error-prone , and slow",Purpose,msa_2213682550
This study develops a building-information-modeling ( BIM ) based approach,Mechanism,msa_2213682550
to support the engineering analysis of reinforced concrete structures,Purpose,msa_2213682550
"In the proposed approach , the damage information is represented along with the geometric , topological , and structural information",Mechanism,msa_2213682550
Transformation and reasoning mechanisms are proposed to utilize the information contained in the BIM,Mechanism,msa_2213682550
to perform strength analysis and visual assessment tasks,Purpose,msa_2213682550
We present the first model,Mechanism,msa_2214183082
of optimal voting under adversarial noise,Purpose,msa_2214183082
"From this viewpoint , voting rules are seen as error-correcting codes : their goal is to correct errors in the input rankings and recover a ranking that is close to the ground truth",Mechanism,msa_2214183082
"We derive worst-case bounds on the relation between the average accuracy of the input votes , and the accuracy of the output ranking",Mechanism,msa_2214183082

"The use of deductive techniques , such as theorem provers , has several advantages in safety verification of hybrid systems",Background,msa_2214315794
"There is often a gap , however , between the type of assistance that a theorem prover requires to make progress on a proof task and the assistance that a system designer is able to provide",Purpose,msa_2214315794
To address this deficiency,Purpose,msa_2214315794
we present an extension to the deductive verification framework of differential dynamic logic,Mechanism,msa_2214315794
that allows the theorem prover KeYmaera to locally reason about behaviors,Purpose,msa_2214315794
"by leveraging forward invariant sets provided by external methods , such as numerical techniques and designer insights",Mechanism,msa_2214315794
"Our key contribution is a new inference rule , the forward invariant cut rule , introduced into the proof calculus of KeYmaera",Mechanism,msa_2214315794
Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning,Background,msa_2215375112
They have proven to be effective in many domains and tasks,Background,msa_2215375112
"Yet , kernel methods often require the user to select a predefined kernel to build an estimator with",Purpose,msa_2215375112
"However , there is often little reason for the a priori selection of a kernel",Purpose,msa_2215375112
"Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected , the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly effected by the choice of kernel",Purpose,msa_2215375112
"Furthermore , when directly applying kernel methods , one typically needs to compute a $ N \times N $ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of $ N $ instances",Purpose,msa_2215375112
The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large datasets,Purpose,msa_2215375112
"In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel ( BaNK ) learning , a generic , data-driven framework",Mechanism,msa_2215375112
for scalable learning of kernels,Purpose,msa_2215375112
We show that this framework can be used for performing both regression and classification tasks and scale to large datasets,Mechanism,msa_2215375112
"Furthermore , we show that BaNK outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel learning",Findings,msa_2215375112
"When solving extensive-form games with large action spaces , typically significant abstraction is needed to make the problem manageable from a modeling or computational perspective",Background,msa_2215989869
"When this occurs , a procedure is needed to interpret actions of the opponent that fall outside of our abstraction ( by mapping them to actions in our abstraction )",Background,msa_2215989869
This is called an action translation mapping,Background,msa_2215989869
Prior action translation mappings have been based on heuristics without theoretical justification,Purpose,msa_2215989869
We show that the prior mappings are highly exploitable and that most of them violate certain natural desiderata,Purpose,msa_2215989869
We present a new mapping,Mechanism,msa_2215989869
that satisfies these desiderata,Purpose,msa_2215989869
and has significantly lower exploitability than the prior mappings,Mechanism,msa_2215989869
"Furthermore , we observe that the cost of this worst-case performance benefit ( low exploitability ) is not high in practice ;",Mechanism,msa_2215989869
our mapping performs competitively with the prior mappings,Findings,msa_2215989869
against no-limit Texas Hold'em agents submitted to the 2012 Annual Computer Poker Competition,Method,msa_2215989869
"This paper studies sound proof rules for checking positive invariance of algebraic and semi-algebraic sets , that is , sets satisfying polynomial equalities and those satisfying finite boolean combinations of polynomial equalities and inequalities , under the flow of polynomial ordinary differential equations",Purpose,msa_2217989345
"Problems of this nature arise in formal verification of continuous and hybrid dynamical systems , where there is an increasing need for methods to expedite formal proofs",Background,msa_2217989345
We study the trade-off between proof rule generality and practical performance and evaluate our theoretical observations on a set of benchmarks,Method,msa_2217989345

"We consider the time evolution of the probability distribution of the network state , the collective states of all the edges ( bonds )",Method,msa_2234362920
", and show that it converges to a stationary distribution",Findings,msa_2234362920
We use this distribution to study the emergence of global behaviors like consensus ( i,Method,msa_2234362920
", catastrophic failure or full recovery of the entire grid ) or coexistence ( i",Method,msa_2234362920
", some failed and some operating substructures in the grid )",Method,msa_2234362920
Image clustering and visual codebook learning are two fundamental problems in computer vision and they are tightly related,Background,msa_2237964723
"On one hand , a good codebook can generate effective feature representations which largely affect clustering performance",Background,msa_2237964723
"On the other hand , class labels obtained from image clustering can serve as supervised information to guide codebook learning",Background,msa_2237964723
"Traditionally , these two processes are conducted separately and their correlation is generally ignored",Purpose,msa_2237964723
"In this paper , we propose a Double Layer Gaussian Mixture Model ( DLGMM )",Mechanism,msa_2237964723
to simultaneously perform image clustering and codebook learning,Purpose,msa_2237964723
"In DLGMM , two tasks are seamlessly coupled and can mutually promote each other",Mechanism,msa_2237964723
Cluster labels and codebook are jointly estimated to achieve the overall best performance,Mechanism,msa_2237964723
"To incorporate the spatial coherence between neighboring visual patches , we propose a Spatially Coherent DL-GMM which uses a Markov Random Field to encourage neighboring patches to share the same visual word label",Mechanism,msa_2237964723
We use variational inference to approximate the posterior of latent variables and learn model parameters,Mechanism,msa_2237964723
Experiments on two datasets,Method,msa_2237964723
"While prior research has studied the motivations of individuals to consume content on social media platforms ,",Background,msa_223854805
limited work exists on how contributors are motivated to create content,Purpose,msa_223854805
"We examine the role of peer influence in content production on YouTube , where content creators are competing for attention",Purpose,msa_223854805
"Given that content creation efforts are driven not only by their personal preferences , but also by the content creation decisions of others in the network neighbors , we develop a new method",Mechanism,msa_223854805
to analyze discrete choice decisions ( such as creating content or not ) in a networked environment,Purpose,msa_223854805
with panel data,Mechanism,msa_223854805
"We face a novel set of big data challenges , i",Mechanism,msa_223854805
", both statistical and quantitative , in estimating peer influence",Mechanism,msa_223854805
"We face computational challenges in that we can not reasonably estimate peer influence over the entire YouTube network , which has billions of nodes",Mechanism,msa_223854805
We employ graph sampling methods to address this issue,Mechanism,msa_223854805
"Identification of social influence in large-scale social networks such as YouTube is difficult due to the interdependence in decisions of users , correlations between the video 's observable and unobservable characteristics and attributes over time",Mechanism,msa_223854805
These patterns can not be modeled with existing autocorrelation models,Mechanism,msa_223854805
"We design a new method , the Network Auto-Probit Model with Fixed Effects ( NAFE ) ,",Mechanism,msa_223854805
to identify peer influence among content creators on YouTube,Purpose,msa_223854805
"Despite the enormous medical impact of cancers and intensive study of their biology , detailed characterization of tumor growth and development remains elusive",Background,msa_2238824573
"This difficulty occurs in large part because of enormous heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression , both tumor-to-tumor and cell-to-cell in single tumors",Background,msa_2238824573
"Advances in genomic technologies , especially at the single-cell level , are improving the situation , but these approaches are held back by limitations of the biotechnologies for gathering genomic data from heterogeneous cell populations and the computational methods for making sense of those data",Background,msa_2238824573
One popular way to gain the advantages of whole-genome methods without the cost of single-cell genomics has been the use of computational deconvolution ( unmixing ) methods to reconstruct clonal heterogeneity from bulk genomic data,Background,msa_2238824573
"These methods , too , are limited by the difficulty of inferring genomic profiles of rare or subtly varying clonal subpopulations from bulk data , a problem that can be computationally reduced to that of reconstructing the geometry of point clouds of tumor samples in a genome space",Purpose,msa_2238824573
"Here , we present a new method",Mechanism,msa_2238824573
to improve that reconstruction,Purpose,msa_2238824573
by better identifying subspaces corresponding to tumors produced from mixtures of distinct combinations of clonal subpopulations,Mechanism,msa_2238824573
We develop a nonparametric clustering method based on medoidshift clustering for identifying subgroups of tumors expected to correspond to distinct trajectories of evolutionary progression,Mechanism,msa_2238824573
We show,Findings,msa_2238824573
on synthetic and real tumor copy-number data,Method,msa_2238824573
"that this new method substantially improves our ability to resolve discrete tumor subgroups ,",Findings,msa_2238824573
"Over the last decade , the looming power wall has spurred a flurry of interest in developing heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators",Background,msa_2239446053
"The questions , then , are what and how accelerators should be designed , and what software support is required",Purpose,msa_2239446053
Our accelerator design approach stems from the observation that many efficient and portable software implementations rely on high performance software libraries with well-established application programming interfaces ( APIs ),Mechanism,msa_2239446053
We propose the integration of hardware accelerators on 3D-stacked memory,Mechanism,msa_2239446053
that explicitly targets the memory-bounded operations within high performance libraries,Purpose,msa_2239446053
"The fixed APIs with limited configurability simplify the design of the accelerators , while ensuring that the accelerators have wide applicability",Mechanism,msa_2239446053
"With our software support that automatically converts library APIs to accelerator invocations , an additional advantage of our approach is that library-based legacy code automatically gains the benefit of memory-side accelerators without requiring a reimplementation",Mechanism,msa_2239446053
"On average , the legacy code using our proposed MEmory Accelerated Library ( MEALib ) improves performance and energy efficiency for individual operations in Intel 's Math Kernel Library ( MKL ) by 38 and 75 , respectively",Findings,msa_2239446053
"For a real-world signal processing application that employs Intel MKL ,",Method,msa_2239446053
The study of representations invariant to common transformations of the data is important to learning,Background,msa_2240403615
Most techniques have focused on local approximate invariance implemented within expensive optimization frameworks lacking explicit theoretical guarantees,Purpose,msa_2240403615
"In this paper , we study kernels that are invariant to the unitary group while having theoretical guarantees",Mechanism,msa_2240403615
in addressing practical issues such as ( 1 ) unavailability of transformed versions of labelled data and ( 2 ) not observing all transformations,Purpose,msa_2240403615
We present a theoretically motivated alternate approach to the invariant kernel SVM,Mechanism,msa_2240403615
"Unlike previous approaches to the invariant SVM , the proposed formulation solves both issues mentioned",Mechanism,msa_2240403615
We also present a kernel extension of a recent technique to extract linear unitary-group invariant features addressing both issues and extend some guarantees regarding invariance and stability,Mechanism,msa_2240403615
We present experiments on the UCI ML datasets,Method,msa_2240403615
"The assembly of virus capsids proceeds by a complicated cascade of association and dissociation steps , the great majority of which can not be directly experimentally observed",Background,msa_2241697860
"This has made capsid assembly a rich field for computational models ,",Background,msa_2241697860
but there are substantial obstacles to model inference for such systems,Purpose,msa_2241697860
"Here , we describe progress on fitting kinetic rate constants defining capsid assembly models to experimental data ,",Mechanism,msa_2241697860
"a difficult data-fitting problem because of the high computational cost of simulating assembly trajectories , the stochastic noise inherent to the models , and the limited and noisy data available for fitting",Purpose,msa_2241697860
We evaluate the merits of data-fitting methods based on derivative-free optimization ( DFO ) relative to gradient-based methods used in prior work,Method,msa_2241697860
We further explore the advantages of alternative data sources through simulation of,Purpose,msa_2241697860
"a model of time-resolved mass spectrometry data , a technology",Mechanism,msa_2241697860
for monitoring bulk capsid assembly,Purpose,msa_2241697860
that can be expected to provide much richer data than previously used static light scattering approaches,Mechanism,msa_2241697860
We present a convex approach,Mechanism,msa_2243068423
to probabilistic segmentation and modeling of time series data,Purpose,msa_2243068423
"Our approach builds upon recent advances in multivariate total variation regularization , and seeks to learn a separate set of parameters for the distribution over the observations at each time point , but with an additional penalty that encourages the parameters to remain constant over time",Mechanism,msa_2243068423
We propose efficient optimization methods,Mechanism,msa_2243068423
for solving the resulting ( large ) optimization problems,Purpose,msa_2243068423
", and a two-stage procedure",Mechanism,msa_2243068423
for estimating recurring clusters,Purpose,msa_2243068423
"under such models , based upon kernel density estimation",Mechanism,msa_2243068423
"Finally , we show on a number of real-world segmentation tasks ,",Method,msa_2243068423
"We propose the problem of predicting a bundle of goods , where the goods considered is a set of spatial locations that an agent wishes to visit",Purpose,msa_2243328796
This typically arises in the tourism setting where attractions can often be bundled and sold as a package to visitors,Background,msa_2243328796
"While the problem of predicting future locations given the current and past trajectories is well-established ,",Background,msa_2243328796
we take a radical approach by looking at it from an economic point of view,Mechanism,msa_2243328796
"We view an agent 's past trajectories as revealed preference ( RP ) data , where the choice of locations is a solution to an optimisation problem according to some unknown utility function and subject to the prevailing prices and budget constraint",Mechanism,msa_2243328796
We approximate the prices and budget constraint as the time costs to finish visiting the chosen locations,Mechanism,msa_2243328796
We leverage on a recent line of work that has established algorithms to efficiently learn from RP data ( i,Mechanism,msa_2243328796
", recover the utility functions ) and make predictions of future purchasing behaviours",Mechanism,msa_2243328796
We adopt and adapt those work to our original setting while incorporating techniques from spatiotemporal analysis,Mechanism,msa_2243328796
We experiment with real-world trajectory data collected from a theme park,Method,msa_2243328796
Our predictions show improved accuracies,Findings,msa_2243328796
in comparison with the baseline methods,Method,msa_2243328796
"Given a large collection of co-evolving online activities , such as searches for the keywords `` Xbox '' , `` PlayStation '' and `` Wii '' , how can we find patterns and rules ? Are these keywords related ? If so , are they competing against each other ? Can we forecast the volume of user activity for the coming month ?",Background,msa_2243564794
We conjecture that online activities compete for user attention in the same way that species in an ecosystem compete for food,Purpose,msa_2243564794
"We present ECOWEB , ( i",Mechanism,msa_2243564794
", Ecosystem on the Web ) , which is an intuitive model designed as a non-linear dynamical system",Mechanism,msa_2243564794
for mining large-scale co-evolving online activities,Purpose,msa_2243564794
"Our second contribution is a novel , parameter-free , and scalable fitting algorithm , ECOWEB-FIT , that estimates the parameters of ECOWEB",Mechanism,msa_2243564794
Extensive experiments on real data,Method,msa_2243564794
Software lineage refers to the evolutionary relationship among a collection of software,Background,msa_224410497
The goal of software lineage inference is to recover the lineage given a set of program binaries,Background,msa_224410497
Software lineage can provide extremely useful information in many security scenarios such as malware triage and software vulnerability tracking,Background,msa_224410497
"In this paper , we systematically study software lineage inference by exploring four fundamental questions not addressed by prior work",Purpose,msa_224410497
"First , how do we automatically infer software lineage from program binaries ? Second , how do we measure the quality of lineage inference algorithms ? Third , how useful are existing approaches to binary similarity analysis for inferring lineage in reality , and how about in an idealized setting ? Fourth , what are the limitations that any software lineage inference algorithm must cope with ? Towards these goals",Purpose,msa_224410497
"we build ILINE , a system",Mechanism,msa_224410497
for automatic software lineage inference of program binaries,Purpose,msa_224410497
", and also IEVAL , a system",Mechanism,msa_224410497
for scientific assessment of lineage quality,Purpose,msa_224410497
"We evaluated ILINE on two types of lineage -- straight line and directed acyclic graph -- with large-scale real-world programs : 1,777 goodware spanning over a combined 110 years of development history and 114 malware with known lineage collected by the DARPA Cyber Genome program",Method,msa_224410497
We used IEVAL to study seven metrics to assess the diverse properties of lineage,Method,msa_224410497
Our results reveal that partial order mismatches and graph arc edit distance often yield the most meaningful comparisons,Findings,msa_224410497
in our experiments,Method,msa_224410497
"With the rise of online social networks and smartphones that record the user 's location , a new type of online social network has gained popularity during the last few years , the so called Location-based Social Networks ( LBSNs )",Background,msa_2248212607
"In such networks , users voluntarily share their location with their friends via a check-in",Background,msa_2248212607
In exchange they get recommendations tailored to their particular location as well as special deals that businesses offer when users check-in frequently,Background,msa_2248212607
"LBSNs started as specialized platforms such as Gowalla and Foursquare , however their immense popularity has led online social networking giants like Facebook to adopt this functionality",Background,msa_2248212607
"The spatial aspect of LBSNs directly ties the physical with the online world , creating a very rich ecosystem where users interact with their friends both online as well as declare their physical ( co- ) presence in various locations",Background,msa_2248212607
Such a rich environment calls for novel analytic tools that can model the aforementioned types of interactions,Purpose,msa_2248212607
"In this work , we propose to model and analyze LBSNs using Tensors and Tensor Decompositions , powerful analytical tools that have enjoyed great growth and success in fields like Machine Learning , Data Mining , and Signal Processing alike",Mechanism,msa_2248212607
"By doing so , we identify tightly knit , hidden communities of users and locations which they frequent",Purpose,msa_2248212607
"In addition to Tensor Decompositions , we use Signal Processing tools that have been previously used in Direction of Arrival ( DOA ) estimations , in order",Mechanism,msa_2248212607
This work focuses on the task of finding latent vector representations of the words in a corpus,Purpose,msa_2250414191
"In particular , we address the issue of what to do when there are multiple languages in the corpus",Purpose,msa_2250414191
"Prior work has , among other techniques , used canonical correlation analysis to project pre-trained vectors in two languages into a common space",Background,msa_2250414191
We propose a simple and scalable method that is inspired by the notion that the learned vector representations should be invariant to translation between languages,Mechanism,msa_2250414191
We show empirically,Method,msa_2250414191

We propose a spectral approach,Mechanism,msa_2251299535
for unsupervised constituent parsing that comes with theoretical guarantees on latent structure recovery,Purpose,msa_2251299535
Our approach is grammarless we directly learn the bracketing structure of a given sentence without using a grammar model,Mechanism,msa_2251299535
The main algorithm is based on lifting the concept of additive tree metrics for structure learning of latent trees in the phylogenetic and machine learning communities to the case where the tree structure varies across examples,Mechanism,msa_2251299535
"Although finding the minimal latent tree is NP-hard in general , for the case of projective trees we find that it can be found using bilexical parsing algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2251299535
"Empirically ,",Method,msa_2251299535
our algorithm performs favorably,Findings,msa_2251299535

for general convex programming,Purpose,msa_2255161621
using fast linear and proximal operators,Mechanism,msa_2255161621
"As with existing convex programming frameworks , users specify convex optimization problems using a natural grammar for mathematical expressions , composing functions in a way that is guaranteed to be convex by the rules of disciplined convex programming",Mechanism,msa_2255161621
"Given such an input , the Epsilon compiler transforms the optimization problem into a mathematically equivalent form consisting only of functions with ecient proximal operators|an intermediate representation we refer to as prox-ane form",Mechanism,msa_2255161621
"By reducing problems to this form , Epsilon enables solving general convex problems using a large library of fast proximal and linear operators ;",Mechanism,msa_2255161621
numerical examples on many popular problems from statistics and machine learning,Method,msa_2255161621
This paper focuses on recursive nonlinear least-squares parameter estimation in multiagent networks,Purpose,msa_2255702686
", where the individual agents observe sequentially over time an independent and identically distributed time-series consisting of a nonlinear function of the true but unknown parameter corrupted by noise",Mechanism,msa_2255702686
"A distributed recursive estimator of the consensus+innovations type , namely $ \mathcal { CIWNLS } $ , is proposed , in which the agents update their parameter estimates at each observation sampling epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing the latest locally sensed information ( innovations ) and the parameter estimates from other agents ( consensus ) in the local neighborhood conforming to a prespecified interagent communication topology",Mechanism,msa_2255702686
"Under rather weak conditions on the connectivity of the interagent communication and a global observability criterion ,",Method,msa_2255702686
"it is shown that , at every network agent , $ \mathcal { CIWNLS } $ leads to consistent parameter estimates",Findings,msa_2255702686
"Furthermore , under standard smoothness assumptions on the local observation functions ,",Method,msa_2255702686
"the distributed estimator is shown to yield order-optimal convergence rates , i",Findings,msa_2255702686
", as far as the order of pathwise convergence is concerned , the local parameter estimates at each agent are as good as the optimal centralized nonlinear least-squares estimator that requires access to all the observations across all the agents at all times",Findings,msa_2255702686
Curriculum learning ( CL ) or self-paced learning ( SPL ) represents a recently proposed learning regime inspired by the learning process of humans and animals that gradually proceeds from easy to more complex samples in training,Background,msa_2256388387
"The two methods share a similar conceptual learning paradigm , but differ in specific learning schemes",Background,msa_2256388387
"In CL , the curriculum is predetermined by prior knowledge , and remain fixed thereafter",Background,msa_2256388387
"Therefore , this type of method heavily relies on the quality of prior knowledge while ignoring feedback about the learner",Purpose,msa_2256388387
"In SPL , the curriculum is dynamically determined to adjust to the learning pace of the leaner",Mechanism,msa_2256388387
"However , SPL is unable to deal with prior knowledge , rendering it prone to overfitting",Purpose,msa_2256388387
"In this paper , we discover the missing link between CL and SPL ,",Purpose,msa_2256388387
and propose a unified framework named self-paced curriculum leaning ( SPCL ),Mechanism,msa_2256388387
SPCL is formulated as a concise optimization problem that takes into account both prior knowledge known before training and the learning progress during training,Mechanism,msa_2256388387
Image and video classification research has made great progress through the development of handcrafted local features and learning based features,Background,msa_2256809320
These two architectures were proposed roughly at the same time and have flourished at overlapping stages of history,Purpose,msa_2256809320
"However , they are typically viewed as distinct approaches",Purpose,msa_2256809320
"In this paper , we emphasize their structural similarities and show how such a unified view helps us in designing features that balance efficiency and effectiveness",Mechanism,msa_2256809320
"As an example , we study the problem of designing efficient video feature learning algorithms for action recognition",Method,msa_2256809320
We approach this problem by first showing that local handcrafted features and Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNNs ) share the same convolution-pooling network structure,Mechanism,msa_2256809320
We then propose a two-stream Convolutional ISA ( ConvISA ) that adopts the convolution-pooling structure of the state-of-the-art handcrafted video feature with greater modeling capacities and a cost-effective training algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2256809320
"Through custom designed network structures for pixels and optical flow , our method also reflects distinctive characteristics of these two data sources",Mechanism,msa_2256809320
Our experimental results on standard action recognition benchmarks,Method,msa_2256809320
Early detection and precise characterization of emerging topics in text streams can be highly useful in applications such as timely and targeted public health interventions and discovering evolving regional business trends,Background,msa_2258204935
Many methods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams using topic modeling,Background,msa_2258204935
"However , these methods have numerous shortcomings that make them unsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text streams",Purpose,msa_2258204935
"In this paper , we describe Semantic Scan ( SS ) that has been developed specifically",Mechanism,msa_2258204935
to overcome these shortcomings in detecting new spatially compact events in text streams,Purpose,msa_2258204935
Semantic Scan integrates novel contrastive topic modeling with online document assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning to identify emerging events with unexpected patterns of keywords hidden in text streams,Mechanism,msa_2258204935
"This enables more timely and accurate detection and characterization of anomalous , spatially localized emerging events",Mechanism,msa_2258204935
"Semantic Scan does not require manual intervention or labeled training data , and is robust to noise in real-world text data since it identifies anomalous text patterns that occur in a cluster of new documents rather than an anomaly in a single new document",Mechanism,msa_2258204935
"We compare Semantic Scan to alternative state-of-the-art methods such as Topics over Time , Online LDA , and Labeled LDA on two real-world tasks : ( i ) a disease surveillance task monitoring free-text Emergency Department chief complaints in Allegheny County , and ( ii ) an emerging business trend detection task based on Yelp reviews",Method,msa_2258204935
This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models,Purpose,msa_2258625096
Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables,Background,msa_2258625096
"While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation , state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly , fail due to memory constraints for very large problems",Purpose,msa_2258625096
"In this paper , we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method",Mechanism,msa_2258625096
"that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems ,",Purpose,msa_2258625096
leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods,Mechanism,msa_2258625096
"We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints , using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence",Mechanism,msa_2258625096
"Using synthetic and genomic data ,",Method,msa_2258625096
Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT deployments,Background,msa_2259009889
The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the cloud,Background,msa_2259009889
This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of today 's cloud-based IoT hub designs,Purpose,msa_2259009889
We propose a solution,Purpose,msa_2259009889
We develop a parallel variational inference ( VI ) procedure,Mechanism,msa_2259016306
"for use in data-distributed settings , where each machine only has access to a subset of data and runs VI independently , without communicating with other machines",Purpose,msa_2259016306
"This type of `` embarrassingly parallel '' procedure has recently been developed for MCMC inference algorithms ; however , in many cases it is not possible to directly extend this procedure to VI methods without requiring certain restrictive exponential family conditions on the form of the model",Purpose,msa_2259016306
"Furthermore , most existing ( nonparallel ) VI methods are restricted to use on conditionally conjugate models , which limits their applicability",Purpose,msa_2259016306
"To combat these issues ,",Purpose,msa_2259016306
"we make use of the recently proposed nonparametric VI to facilitate an embarrassingly parallel VI procedure that can be applied to a wider scope of models , including to nonconjugate models",Mechanism,msa_2259016306
We derive our embarrassingly parallel VI algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2259016306
", analyze our method theoretically ,",Method,msa_2259016306
and demonstrate our method,Findings,msa_2259016306
Introduction : We document a funded effort to bridge the gap between constrained scientific challenges of public health surveillance and methodologies from academia and industry,Purpose,msa_2259258356
"Component tasks are the collection of epidemiologists use case problems , multidisciplinary consultancies to refine them , and dissemination of problem requirements and shareable datasets",Method,msa_2259258356
We describe an initial use case and consultancy as a concrete example and challenge to developers,Method,msa_2259258356
"Materials and Methods : Supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency Biosurveillance Ecosystem project , the International Society for Disease Surveillance formed an advisory group to select tractable use case problems and convene inter-disciplinary consultancies to translate analytic needs into well-defined problems and to promote development of applicable solution methods",Mechanism,msa_2259258356
The initial consultancys focus was a problem originated by the North Carolina Department of Health and its NC DETECT surveillance system : Derive a method for detection of patient record clusters worthy of follow-up based on free-text chief complaints and without syndromic classification,Mechanism,msa_2259258356
Results : Direct communication between public health problem owners and analytic developers was informative to both groups and constructive for the solution development process,Findings,msa_2259258356
The consultancy achieved refinement of the asyndromic detection challenge and of solution requirements,Findings,msa_2259258356
Participants summarized and evaluated solution approaches and discussed dissemination and collaboration strategies,Findings,msa_2259258356
"In this paper , we define the problem of coreference resolution in text as one of clustering with pairwise constraints where human experts are asked to provide pairwise constraints ( pairwise judgments of coreferentiality )",Mechanism,msa_2259377089
to guide the clustering process,Purpose,msa_2259377089
"Positing that these pairwise judgments are easy to obtain from humans given the right context ,",Method,msa_2259377089
"we show that with significantly lower number of pairwise judgments and feature-engineering effort , we can achieve competitive coreference performance",Findings,msa_2259377089
"Further , we describe an active learning strategy",Mechanism,msa_2259377089
that minimizes the overall number of such pairwise judgments needed,Purpose,msa_2259377089
by asking the most informative questions to human experts at each step of coreference resolution,Mechanism,msa_2259377089
The Restricted Isometric Property ( R,Background,msa_2259682197
P,Background,msa_2259682197
) is a very important condition for recovering sparse vectors from high dimensional space,Background,msa_2259682197
Traditional methods often rely on R,Background,msa_2259682197
P or its relaxed variants,Background,msa_2259682197
"However , in real applications , features are often correlated to each other , which makes these assumptions too strong to be useful",Purpose,msa_2259682197
"In this paper , we study the sparse recovery problem in which the feature matrix is strictly non-R",Method,msa_2259682197
P,Method,msa_2259682197
"We prove that when features exhibit cluster structures , which often happens in real applications , we are able to recover the sparse vector consistently",Mechanism,msa_2259682197
"The consistency comes from our proposed density correction algorithm , which removes the variance of estimated cluster centers using cluster density",Mechanism,msa_2259682197
We propose two well-motivated ranking-based methods,Mechanism,msa_2261464048
to enhance the performance of current state-of-the-art human activity recognition systems,Purpose,msa_2261464048
"First , as an improvement over the classic power normalization method , we propose a parameter-free ranking technique called rank normalization ( RaN )",Mechanism,msa_2261464048
RaN normalizes each dimension of the video features to address the sparse and bursty distribution problems of Fisher Vectors and VLAD,Mechanism,msa_2261464048
"Second , inspired by curriculum learning , we introduce a training-free re-ranking technique called multi-class iterative re-ranking ( MIR )",Mechanism,msa_2261464048
MIR captures relationships among action classes by separating easy and typical videos from difficult ones and re-ranking the prediction scores of classifiers accordingly,Mechanism,msa_2261464048
We demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art motion features,Findings,msa_2261464048

Propagation of contagion in networks depends on the graph topology,Background,msa_2262358154
This paper is concerned with studying the time-asymptotic behavior of the extended contact processes,Purpose,msa_2262358154
"on static , undirected , finite-size networks",Mechanism,msa_2262358154
"This is a contact process with nonzero exogenous infection rate ( also known as the { \epsilon } -SIS , { \epsilon } susceptible-infected-susceptible , model [ 1 ] )",Mechanism,msa_2262358154
The only known analytical characterization of the equilibrium distribution of this process is for complete networks,Background,msa_2262358154
"For large networks with arbitrary topology , it is infeasible to numerically solve for the equilibrium distribution since it requires solving the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem of a matrix that is exponential in N , the size of the network",Background,msa_2262358154
"We show that , for a certain range of the network process parameters , the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process on arbitrary , finite-size networks is well approximated by the equilibrium distribution of the scaled SIS process , which we derived in closed-form in prior work",Mechanism,msa_2262358154
We confirm this result,Findings,msa_2262358154
with numerical simulations comparing the equilibrium distribution of the extended contact process with that of a scaled SIS process,Method,msa_2262358154
"The widespread use of social networks enables the rapid diffusion of information , e",Background,msa_2263820108
", news , among users in very large communities",Background,msa_2263820108
"It is a substantial challenge to be able to observe and understand such diffusion processes , which may be modeled as networks that are both large and dynamic",Background,msa_2263820108
A key tool in this regard is data summarization,Background,msa_2263820108
"However , few existing studies aim to summarize graphs/networks for dynamics",Background,msa_2263820108
"Dynamic networks raise new challenges not found in static settings , including time sensitivity and the needs for online interestingness evaluation and summary traceability , which render existing techniques inapplicable",Background,msa_2263820108
"We study the topic of dynamic network summarization : how to summarize dynamic networks with millions of nodes by only capturing the few most interesting nodes or edges over time , and we address the problem by finding interestingness-driven diffusion processes",Purpose,msa_2263820108
"Based on the concepts of diffusion radius and scope , we define interestingness measures for dynamic networks , and we propose OSNet , an online summarization framework",Mechanism,msa_2263820108
for dynamic networks,Purpose,msa_2263820108
We report on extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-life data,Method,msa_2263820108
Session types provide a means to prescribe the communication behavior between concurrent message-passing processes,Background,msa_2264604278
"However , in a distributed setting , some processes may be written in languages that do not support static typing of sessions or may be compromised by a malicious intruder , violating invariants of the session types",Background,msa_2264604278
"In such a setting , dynamically monitoring communication between processes becomes a necessity for identifying undesirable actions",Purpose,msa_2264604278
"In this paper , we show how to dynamically monitor communication to enforce adherence to session types in a higher-order setting",Purpose,msa_2264604278
We present a system of,Mechanism,msa_2264604278
blame assignment,Purpose,msa_2264604278
in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised,Mechanism,msa_2264604278

We propose a distributed approach,Mechanism,msa_2265605300
to train deep neural networks ( DNNs ),Purpose,msa_2265605300
", which has guaranteed convergence",Findings,msa_2265605300
theoretically,Method,msa_2265605300
and great scalability,Findings,msa_2265605300
empirically,Method,msa_2265605300
: close to 6 times faster on instance of ImageNet data set when run with 6 machines,Findings,msa_2265605300
"The proposed scheme is close to optimally scalable in terms of number of machines , and guaranteed to converge to the same optima as the undistributed setting",Mechanism,msa_2265605300
The convergence and scalability of the distributed setting is,Mechanism,msa_2265605300
shown,Findings,msa_2265605300
empirically across di ? erent datasets ( TIMIT and ImageNet ) and machine learning tasks ( image classi ? cation and phoneme extraction ),Method,msa_2265605300
We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression problems,Purpose,msa_2266653482
"using convex relaxation of L1 regularization , also known as the Lasso , as an initialization step",Mechanism,msa_2266653482
"Our algorithm , the Lass-0 ( `` Lass-zero '' ) , uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution",Mechanism,msa_2266653482
We present theoretical,Method,msa_2266653482
results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features,Findings,msa_2266653482
Empirically,Method,msa_2266653482
", we demonstrate on synthetic data that the Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models",Findings,msa_2266653482

"WearWrite lets authors give writing instructions and provide bits of expertise and big picture directions from their smartwatch , while crowd workers actually write the document on more powerful devices",Mechanism,msa_2271450789
"We used this approach to write three academic papers ,",Method,msa_2271450789
"In applied fields , practitioners hoping to apply causal structure learning or causal orientation algorithms face an important question : which independence test is appropriate for my data ? In the case of real-valued iid data , linear dependencies , and Gaussian error terms , partial correlation is sufficient",Background,msa_2273081434
"But once any of these assumptions is modified , the situation becomes more complex",Background,msa_2273081434
"Kernel-based tests of independence have gained popularity to deal with nonlinear dependencies in recent years , but testing for conditional independence remains a challenging problem",Purpose,msa_2273081434
"We highlight the important issue of non-iid observations : when data are observed in space , time , or on a network , nearby observations are likely to be similar",Purpose,msa_2273081434
This fact biases estimates of dependence between variables,Purpose,msa_2273081434
"Inspired by the success of Gaussian process regression for handling non-iid observations in a wide variety of areas and by the usefulness of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion ( HSIC ) , a kernel-based independence test , we propose a simple framework to address all of these issues : first , use Gaussian process regression to control",Mechanism,msa_2273081434
for certain variables and to obtain residuals,Purpose,msa_2273081434
"Second , use HSIC",Mechanism,msa_2273081434
to test for independence,Purpose,msa_2273081434
"We illustrate this on two classic datasets , one spatial , the other temporal , that are usually treated as iid",Method,msa_2273081434
We show how properly accounting for spatial and temporal variation can lead to more reasonable causal graphs,Findings,msa_2273081434
"We also show how highly structured data , like images and text , can be used in a causal inference framework using a novel structured input/output Gaussian process formulation",Findings,msa_2273081434

"Recently diversity-inducing regularization methods for latent variable models ( LVMs ) , which encourage the components in LVMs to be diverse , have been studied",Background,msa_2281466631
to address several issues involved in latent variable modeling : ( 1 ) how to capture long-tail patterns underlying data ; ( 2 ) how to reduce model complexity without sacrificing expressivity ; ( 3 ) how to improve the interpretability of learned patterns,Purpose,msa_2281466631
"While the effectiveness of diversity-inducing regularizers such as the mutual angular regularizer has been demonstrated empirically , a rigorous theoretical analysis of them is still missing",Purpose,msa_2281466631
"In this paper , we aim to bridge this gap and analyze how the mutual angular regularizer ( MAR ) affects the generalization performance of supervised LVMs",Purpose,msa_2281466631
We use neural network ( NN ) as a model instance to carry out the study and the analysis shows that increasing the diversity of hidden units in NN would reduce estimation error and increase approximation error,Mechanism,msa_2281466631

for spotting fraudsters and fake reviews in online review datasets,Purpose,msa_2282288858
"Our method has several advantages : ( 1 ) it exploits the network effect among reviewers and products , unlike the vast majority of existing methods that focus on review text or behavioral analysis , ( 2 ) it consists of two complementary steps ; scoring users and reviews for fraud detection , and grouping for visualization and sensemaking , ( 3 ) it operates in a completely unsupervised fashion requiring no labeled data , while still incorporating side information if available , and ( 4 ) it is scalable to large datasets as its run time grows linearly with network size",Mechanism,msa_2282288858

"We demonstrate that the weighted ensemble ( WE ) strategy , initially developed for molecular simulations",Mechanism,msa_2284531492
", applies effectively to spatially resolved cell-scale simulations",Purpose,msa_2284531492
The WE approach runs an ensemble of parallel trajectories with assigned weights and uses a statistical resampling strategy of replicating and pruning trajectories to focus computational effort on difficult-to-sample regions,Mechanism,msa_2284531492

We address the problem of generating video features for action recognition,Purpose,msa_2285251378
The spatial pyramid and its variants have been very popular feature models due to their success in balancing spatial location encoding and spatial invariance,Background,msa_2285251378
"Although it seems straightforward to extend spatial pyramid to the temporal domain ( spatio-temporal pyramid ) , the large spatio-temporal diversity of unconstrained videos and the resulting significantly higher dimensional representations make it less appealing",Purpose,msa_2285251378
"This paper introduces the space-time extended descriptor , a simple but efficient alternative way",Mechanism,msa_2285251378
to include the spatio-temporal location into the video features,Purpose,msa_2285251378
"Instead of only coding motion information and leaving the spatio-temporal location to be represented at the pooling stage , location information is used as part of the encoding step",Mechanism,msa_2285251378
This method is a much more effective and efficient location encoding method as compared to the fixed grid model because it avoids the danger of over committing to artificial boundaries and its dimension is relatively low,Mechanism,msa_2285251378

Theorem provers based on differential dynamic logic have been used to verify safety properties for models of self-driving cars and collision avoidance protocols for aircraft,Background,msa_2286742647
"Unfortunately , these theorem provers do not have explicit proof terms , which makes the implementation of a number of important features unnecessarily complicated without soundness-critical and extra-logical extensions to the theorem prover",Purpose,msa_2286742647
"Examples include : an unambiguous separation between proof checking and proof search , the ability to extract program traces corresponding to counter-examples , and synthesis of surely-live deterministic programs from liveness proofs for nondeterministic programs",Background,msa_2286742647

People are more creative at solving difficult design problems when they use relevant examples from outside of the problem s domain as inspirations,Background,msa_2290652328
"However , finding such outside-the-box inspirations is difficult , particularly in large idea repositories such as the web , because without guidance people select domains to search based on surface similarity to the problem s domain",Purpose,msa_2290652328

Data reorganization handled completely in memory improves the host processor 's memory access performance,Background,msa_2291192530

"How do people interact with their Facebook wall ? At a high level , this question captures the essence of our work",Background,msa_2291301591
"While most prior efforts focus on Twitter , the much fewer Facebook studies focus on the friendship graph or are limited by the amount of users or the duration of the study",Background,msa_2291301591

Biomedical scientists have invested significant effort into making it easy to perform lots of experiments quickly and cheaply,Background,msa_2292640198
These high throughput methods are the workhorses of modern systems biology efforts,Background,msa_2292640198
"However , we simply can not perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type , genetic mutation and other conditions",Background,msa_2292640198
"In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets , or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored",Background,msa_2292640198
"But which experiments should we pick ? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately , the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be , or a combination of the two ? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time",Background,msa_2292640198
"However , computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments , and machine learning algorithms allow computers to learn how to make predictions and decisions based on the data theyve previously processed",Background,msa_2292640198
Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed active learning could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done,Purpose,msa_2292640198
"Now , Naik et al",Mechanism,msa_2292640198
have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope,Mechanism,msa_2292640198
The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you cant predict ( or that you predicted incorrectly ) than from just confirming your confident predictions,Mechanism,msa_2292640198
The results of the robot-driven experiments,Method,msa_2292640198

"In large-scale complex networks , the underlying nonlinear dynamical system is high-dimensional and performing qualitative analysis of the differential equation becomes prohibitive",Background,msa_2292780929

FUTUREMATCH takes as input a high-level objective ( e,Mechanism,msa_2293140664

It uses data from all live kidney transplants in the US since 1987 to learn the quality of each possible match ; it then learns the potentials of elements of the current input graph offline ( e,Mechanism,msa_2293140664

"There is often a large disparity between the size of a game we wish to solve and the size of the largest instances solvable by the best algorithms ; for example , a popular variant of poker has about 10165 nodes in its game tree , while the currently best approximate equilibrium-finding algorithms scale to games with around 1012 nodes",Background,msa_2294747104
"In order to approximate equilibrium strategies in these games , the leading approach is to create a sufficiently small strategic approximation of the full game , called an abstraction , and to solve that smaller game instead",Background,msa_2294747104
"The leading abstraction algorithm for imperfect-information games generates abstractions that have imperfect recall and are distribution aware , using k-means with the earth mover 's distance metric to cluster similar states together",Background,msa_2294747104
"A distribution-aware abstraction groups states together at a given round if their full distributions over future strength are similar ( as opposed to , for example , just the expectation of their strength )",Background,msa_2294747104
The leading algorithm considers distributions over future strength at the final round of the game,Background,msa_2294747104
"However , one might benefit by considering the trajectory of distributions over strength in all future rounds , not just the final round",Purpose,msa_2294747104
An abstraction algorithm that takes all future rounds into account is called potential aware,Purpose,msa_2294747104

"Non-technical loss ( NTL ) represents a major challenge when providing reliable electrical service in developing countries , where it often accounts for 11-15 % of total generation capacity [ 1 ]",Background,msa_2294988046
"NTL is caused by a variety of factors such as theft , unmetered homes , and inability to pay which at volume can lead to system instability , grid failure , and major financial losses for providers",Background,msa_2294988046
"In this paper , we investigate error sources and techniques for separating NTL from total losses in microgrids",Purpose,msa_2294988046

"For the important task of binocular depth perception from complex natural-image stimuli , the neurophysiological basis for disambiguating multiple matches between the eyes across similar features has remained a long-standing problem",Background,msa_2295431043
Recurrent interactions among binocular disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) could play a role in stereoscopic computationsbyalteringresponsesto favorthemost likelydepthinterpretation fora givenimagepair,Background,msa_2295431043
Psychophysicalresearch has shown that binocular disparity stimuli displayed in 1 region of the visualfield can be extrapolated into neighboring regions that contain ambiguous depth information,Background,msa_2295431043
We tested whether neurons in macaque V1 interact in a similar manner,Purpose,msa_2295431043
and found that unambiguous binocular disparity stimuli displayed in the surrounding visualfields of disparity-selective V1 neurons indeed modified their responses when either bistable stereoscopic or uniform featureless stimuli were presented within their receptivefield centers,Findings,msa_2295431043
The delayed timing of the response behavior compared with the timing of classical surround suppression and multiple control experiments suggests that these modulations are carried out by slower disparity-specific recurrentconnectionsamongV1neurons,Findings,msa_2295431043

Regret matching is a widely-used algorithm for learning how to act,Background,msa_2295608693
We begin by proving that regrets on actions in one setting ( game ) can be transferred to warm start the regrets for solving a different setting with same structure but different payoffs that can be written as a function of parameters,Purpose,msa_2295608693
We prove how this can be done by carefully discounting the prior regrets,Mechanism,msa_2295608693
"This provides , to our knowledge , the first principled warm-starting method",Mechanism,msa_2295608693
for no-regret learning,Purpose,msa_2295608693
It also extends to warm-starting the widely-adopted counterfactual regret minimization ( CFR ) algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2295608693
for large incomplete-information games ;,Purpose,msa_2295608693
we show this experimentally as well,Method,msa_2295608693
We then study optimizing a parameter vector for a player in a two-player zero-sum game ( e,Mechanism,msa_2295608693
", optimizing bet sizes to use in poker )",Mechanism,msa_2295608693
We propose a custom gradient descent algorithm that provably finds a locally optimal parameter vector while leveraging our warm-start theory to significantly save regret-matching iterations at each step,Mechanism,msa_2295608693
It optimizes the parameter vector while simultaneously finding an equilibrium,Mechanism,msa_2295608693

"We adopt a utilitarian perspective on social choice , assuming that agents have ( possibly latent ) utility functions over some space of alternatives",Purpose,msa_2295870642
"For many reasons one might consider mechanisms , or social choice functions , that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual agents rather than their utility functions",Background,msa_2295870642
"In this context , one possible objective for a social choice function is the maximization of ( expected ) social welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings",Purpose,msa_2295870642
We study such optimal social choice functions,Purpose,msa_2295870642
"under three different models ,",Mechanism,msa_2295870642
and underscore the important role played by scoring functions,Purpose,msa_2295870642
"In our worst-case model , no assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the worst-case distortion-or degree to which the selected alternative does not maximize social welfare-of optimal ( randomized ) social choice functions",Mechanism,msa_2295870642
"In our average-case model , we derive optimal functions under neutral ( or impartial culture ) probabilistic models",Mechanism,msa_2295870642

In Massively Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) TA resources are limited ; most MOOCs use peer assessments to grade assignments,Background,msa_2295994670
Students have to divide up their time between working on their own homework and grading others,Background,msa_2295994670
"If there is no risk of being caught and penalized , students have no reason to spend any time grading others",Background,msa_2295994670
Course staff want to incentivize students to balance their time between course work and peer grading,Background,msa_2295994670
"They may do so by auditing students , ensuring that they perform grading correctly",Purpose,msa_2295994670
"One would not want students to invest too much time on peer grading , as this would result in poor course performance",Purpose,msa_2295994670

For decades researchers have struggled with the problem of envy-free cake cutting : how to divide a divisible good between multiple agents so that each agent likes his own allocation best,Background,msa_2296287489
"Although an envy-free cake cutting protocol was ultimately devised , it is unbounded , in the sense that the number of operations can be arbitrarily large , depending on the preferences of the agents",Purpose,msa_2296287489
We ask whether bounded protocols exist when the agents ' preferences are restricted,Purpose,msa_2296287489
"Achieving high performance for compute bounded numerical kernels typically requires an expert to hand select an appropriate set of Single-instruction multiple-data ( SIMD ) instructions , then statically scheduling them in order to hide their latency while avoiding register spilling in the process",Background,msa_2296357119
"Unfortunately , this level of control over the code forces the expert to trade programming abstraction for performance which is why many performance critical kernels are written in assembly language",Background,msa_2296357119
"An alternative is to either resort to auto-vectorization ( see Figure 1 ) or to use intrinsic functions , both features offered by compilers",Background,msa_2296357119
"However , in both scenarios the expert loses control over which instructions are selected , which optimizations are applied to the code and moreover how the instructions are scheduled for a target architecture",Background,msa_2296357119
"Ideally , the expert would need assembly-like control over their SIMD instructions beyond what intrinsics provide while maintaining a C-level abstraction for the non-performance critical parts",Purpose,msa_2296357119
"In this paper ,",Mechanism,msa_2296357119
we bridge the gap between performance and abstraction for SIMD instructions,Purpose,msa_2296357119
This article introduces a relatively complete proof calculus,Mechanism,msa_2296642625
for differential dynamic logic,Purpose,msa_2296642625
"( dL ) that is entirely based on uniform substitution , a proof rule that substitutes a formula for a predicate symbol everywhere",Mechanism,msa_2296642625
"Uniform substitutions make it possible to use axioms instead of axiom schemata , thereby substantially simplifying implementations",Mechanism,msa_2296642625
"Instead of subtle schema variables and soundness-critical side conditions on the occurrence patterns of logical variables to restrict infinitely many axiom schema instances to sound ones , the resulting calculus adopts only a finite number of ordinary dLformulas as axioms , which uniform substitutions instantiate soundly",Mechanism,msa_2296642625
The static semantics of differential dynamic logic and the soundness-critical restrictions it imposes on proof steps is captured exclusively in uniform substitutions and variable renamings as opposed to being spread in delicate ways across the prover implementation,Mechanism,msa_2296642625
"In addition to sound uniform substitutions , this article introduces differential forms for differential dynamic logic that make it possible to internalize differential invariants , differential substitutions , and derivatives as first-class axioms to reason about differential equations axiomatically",Mechanism,msa_2296642625
"Complex event detection is a retrieval task with the goal of finding videos of a particular event in a large-scale unconstrained internet video archive , given example videos and text descriptions",Background,msa_2296660860
"Nowadays , different multimodal fusion schemes of low-level and high-level features are extensively investigated and evaluated for the complex event detection task",Purpose,msa_2296660860
"However , how to effectively select the high-level semantic meaningful concepts from a large pool to assist complex event detection is rarely studied in the literature",Purpose,msa_2296660860

This paper considers the development of information flow analyses,Mechanism,msa_2299205035
to support resilient design and active detection of adversaries in cyber physical systems ( CPS ),Purpose,msa_2299205035
"CPS security , though well studied , suffers from fragmentation",Background,msa_2299205035
"In this paper , we consider control systems as an abstraction of CPS",Purpose,msa_2299205035
"Here , we use information flow analysis , a well established set of methods developed in software security ,",Mechanism,msa_2299205035
to obtain a unified framework that captures and extends results in control system security,Purpose,msa_2299205035
"Specifically , we propose the Kullback Liebler ( KL ) divergence as a causal measure of information flow , which quantifies the effect of adversarial inputs on sensor outputs",Mechanism,msa_2299205035
We show that the proposed measure characterizes the resilience of control systems to specific attack strategies by relating the KL divergence to optimal detection,Mechanism,msa_2299205035
We then relate information flows to stealthy attack scenarios where an adversary can bypass detection,Mechanism,msa_2299205035
"Finally , this article examines active detection mechanisms where a defender intelligently manipulates control inputs or the system itself to elicit information flows from an attacker 's malicious behavior",Method,msa_2299205035

Combining deep neural networks with structured logic rules is desirable to harness flexibility and reduce uninterpretability of the neural models,Purpose,msa_2311110368
We propose a general framework,Mechanism,msa_2311110368
capable of enhancing various types of neural networks ( e,Purpose,msa_2311110368
", CNNs and RNNs ) with declarative first-order logic rules",Purpose,msa_2311110368
"Specifically , we develop an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of logic rules into the weights of neural networks",Mechanism,msa_2311110368
"We deploy the framework on a CNN for sentiment analysis , and an RNN for named entity recognition",Method,msa_2311110368
We demonstrate four-terminal GeTe-based RF switches with,Mechanism,msa_2313273242
independent thermal actuation ( switching ),Purpose,msa_2313273242
These devices incorporate an AlN-based dielectric separating high-conductivity W micro-heaters from the RF signal path,Mechanism,msa_2313273242
"With dc , pulsed , and RF testing ,",Method,msa_2313273242
we show that an AlN barrier decreases the switch parasitic capacitance with minimal increases in the switching power,Findings,msa_2313273242
"Decoupling these design variables , with the high thermal conductivity of the AlN , makes it possible to increase the electrical separation with a thicker AlN film for lower parasitic capacitance with minimal decrease in desirable thermal coupling",Mechanism,msa_2313273242
Increasing the AlN thickness from 105 to 170 nm,Mechanism,msa_2313273242
This paper studies the convergence of the estimation error process and the characterization of the corresponding invariant measure,Purpose,msa_2314417073
in distributed Kalman filtering for poten tially unstable and large linear dynamic systems,Mechanism,msa_2314417073
"A gossip network protocol termed Modified Gossip Interactive Kalman Filteri ng ( M-GIKF ) is proposed , where sensors exchange their filtered states ( estimates and error covariances ) and propagate their observations via inter-sensor communications of rate ; is defined as the averaged number of inter-sensor message passa ges per signal evolution epoch",Mechanism,msa_2314417073
The filtered states are interpre ted as stochastic particles swapped through local interaction,Mechanism,msa_2314417073
The paper shows that the conditional estimation error covariance sequence at each sensor under M-GIKF evolves as a random Riccati equa- tion ( RRE ) with Markov modulated switching,Mechanism,msa_2314417073
By formulating the RRE as a random dynamical system,Method,msa_2314417073
", it is shown that the network achieves weak consensus , i",Findings,msa_2314417073
", the conditional estimation error covariance at a randomly selected sensor converges weakly ( in distribution ) to a unique invariant measure",Findings,msa_2314417073
"Further , it is proved that as ! 1 this invariant measure satisfies the Large Deviation ( LD ) upper and lower bounds , implying that this measure converges exponentially fast ( in probability ) to the Dirac measureP , where Pis the stable error covariance of the centralized ( Kalman ) filtering setup",Findings,msa_2314417073
How can we analyze large-scale real-world data with various attributes ? Many real-world data ( e,Background,msa_2314964555
", network traffic logs , web data , social networks , knowledge bases , and sensor streams ) with multiple attributes are represented as multi-dimensional arrays , called tensors",Background,msa_2314964555
"For analyzing a tensor , tensor decompositions are widely used in many data mining applications : detecting malicious attackers in network traffic logs ( with source IP , destination IP , port-number , timestamp ) , finding telemarketers in a phone call history ( with sender , receiver , date ) , and identifying interesting concepts in a knowledge base ( with subject , object , relation )",Background,msa_2314964555
"However , current tensor decomposition methods do not scale to large and sparse real-world tensors with millions of rows and columns and `fibers",Purpose,msa_2314964555
',Purpose,msa_2314964555
"In this paper , we propose HaTen2 , a distributed method",Mechanism,msa_2314964555
for large-scale tensor decompositions,Purpose,msa_2314964555
that runs on the MapReduce framework,Mechanism,msa_2314964555
Our careful design and implementation of HaTen2 dramatically reduce the size of intermediate data and the number of jobs leading to achieve high scalability compared with the state-of-the-art method,Mechanism,msa_2314964555
"Thanks to HaTen2 , we analyze big real-world sparse tensors that can not be handled by the current state of the art ,",Method,msa_2314964555
Mental simulation is an important skill for program understanding and prediction of program behavior,Background,msa_2318857040
Assessing students ' ability to mentally simulate program execution can be challenging in graphical programming environments and on paper-based assessments,Purpose,msa_2318857040
This poster presents the iterative design and refinement process,Mechanism,msa_2318857040
for assessing students ' ability to mentally simulate and predict code behavior,Purpose,msa_2318857040
using a novel introductory computational thinking curriculum for Microsoft 's Kodu Game Lab,Mechanism,msa_2318857040
We present an analysis of question prompts and student responses from data collected from three rising 3rd - 6th graders where the curriculum was implemented,Method,msa_2318857040
Analysis of student responses suggest that this type of question can be used to identify misconceptions and misinterpretation of instructions,Findings,msa_2318857040
"We introduce the notion of balance for directed graphs : aweighted directed graph is -balanced if for every cut S V , the total weight of edges going from S to V S is within factor of the total weight of edges going from V S to S",Mechanism,msa_2319135850
"Several important families of graphs are nearly balanced , in particular , Eulerian graphs ( with 0 1 ) and residual graphs of ( 1+ ) -approximate undirected maximum flows ( with 0 O ( 1/ ) )",Background,msa_2319135850
We use the notion of balance to give a more fine-grained understanding of several well-studied routing questions that are considerably harder in directed graphs,Purpose,msa_2319135850
We first revisit oblivious routings in directed graphs,Mechanism,msa_2319135850
Our main algorithmic result is an oblivious routing scheme for single-source instances that achieve an O ( log 3 n / loglog n ) competitive ratio,Mechanism,msa_2319135850
"In the process , we make several technical contributions which may be of independent interest",Mechanism,msa_2319135850
"In particular , we give an efficient algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2319135850
for computing low-radius decompositions of directed graphs parameterized by balance,Purpose,msa_2319135850
"We also define and construct low-stretch arborescences , a generalization of low-stretch spanning trees to directed graphs",Mechanism,msa_2319135850
"On the negative side , we present new lower bounds for oblivious routing problems on directed graphs",Mechanism,msa_2319135850
We show that the competitive ratio of oblivious routing algorithms for directed graphs is ( n ) in general ; this result improves upon the long-standing best known lower bound of ( n ) by Hajiaghayi et al,Mechanism,msa_2319135850
We also show that our restriction to single-source instances is necessary by showing an ( n ) lower bound for multiple-source oblivious routing in Eulerian graphs,Mechanism,msa_2319135850
We also study the maximum flow problem in balanced directed graphs with arbitrary capacities,Mechanism,msa_2319135850
We develop an efficient algorithm that finds an ( 1+ ) -approximate maximum flows in -balanced graphs in time O ( m 2 / 2 ),Mechanism,msa_2319135850
"We show that , using our approximate maximum flow algorithm , we can efficiently determine whether a given directed graph is -balanced",Findings,msa_2319135850
Virtual machine ( VM ) migration demands distinct properties under resource oversubscription and workload surges,Background,msa_2321806367
"We present enlightened post-copy , a new mechanism",Mechanism,msa_2321806367
for VMs under contention,Purpose,msa_2321806367
that evicts the target VM with fast execution transfer and short total duration,Mechanism,msa_2321806367
"This design contrasts with common live migration , which uses the down time of the migrated VM as its primary metric ; it instead focuses on recovering the aggregate performance of the VMs being affected",Mechanism,msa_2321806367
"In enlightened post-copy , the guest OS identifies memory state that is expected to encompass the VM 's working set",Mechanism,msa_2321806367
"The hypervisor accordingly transfers its state , mitigating the performance impact on the migrated VM resulting from post-copy transfer",Mechanism,msa_2321806367
"We show that our implementation ,",Findings,msa_2321806367
with modest instrumentation in guest Linux,Method,msa_2321806367
"In this paper , we explore how the contextual ambiguity of a search can affect a keyword 's performance",Purpose,msa_232477822
The context of consumer search is often unobserved and the prediction of it can be nontrivial,Background,msa_232477822
"Consumers arrive at search engines with diverse interests , and their search context may vary even when they are searching using the same keyword",Background,msa_232477822
"In our study , we propose",Mechanism,msa_232477822
an automatic way of examining keyword contextual ambiguity,Purpose,msa_232477822
based on probabilistic topic models from machine learning and computational linguistics,Mechanism,msa_232477822
We examine the effect of contextual ambiguity on keyword performance,Purpose,msa_232477822
"using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that allows for topic-specific effects and nonlinear position effects , and jointly models click-through rate ( CTR ) and ad position ( rank )",Mechanism,msa_232477822
"We validate our study using a novel data set from a major search engine that contains information on consumer click activities for 2,625 distinct keywords across multiple product categories from 10,000 impressions",Method,msa_232477822
"We find that consumer click behavior varies significantly across keywords , and such variation can be partially explained by keyword category and the contextual ambiguity of keywords",Findings,msa_232477822
"Specifically , higher contextual ambiguity is associated with higher CTR on top-positioned ads , but also a faster decay in CTR with screen position",Findings,msa_232477822
"Therefore , the overall effect of contextual ambiguity on CTR varies across positions",Findings,msa_232477822
"Pipes carrying pressurized fluids are an important part of the civil infrastructure , and structural health monitoring ( SHM ) could ensure structural integrity by predicting and preventing structural failures",Background,msa_2324805233
Guided wave ultrasonics is a good candidate for use in pipe SHM because guided waves can propagate long distances and are sensitive to structural damage such as cracks and corrosion losses,Background,msa_2324805233
"However , the multi-modal and dispersive characteristics of guided waves make it difficult to interpret their arrival records",Purpose,msa_2324805233
"Moreover , guided waves are also sensitive to environmental and operational variations , limiting the effectiveness of ultrasonic methods to detect pipe damage in a real environment",Purpose,msa_2324805233
We introduce a damage detector based on singular value decomposition ( SVD ),Mechanism,msa_2324805233
that can identify a change of interest,Purpose,msa_2324805233
", caused by a mass scatterer that simulates subtle damage , under realistic environmental variations",Mechanism,msa_2324805233

Multimedia event detection has been one of the major endeavors in video event analysis,Background,msa_2327894203
A variety of approaches have been proposed recently to tackle this problem,Background,msa_2327894203
"Among others , using semantic representation has been accredited for its promising performance and desirable ability for human-understandable reasoning",Background,msa_2327894203
"To generate semantic representation , we usually utilize several external image/video archives and apply the concept detectors trained on them to the event videos",Background,msa_2327894203
"Due to the intrinsic difference of these archives , the resulted representation is presumable to have different predicting capabilities for a certain event",Background,msa_2327894203
"Notwithstanding , not much work is available for assessing the efficacy of semantic representation from the source-level",Purpose,msa_2327894203
"On the other hand , it is plausible to perceive that some concepts are noisy for detecting a specific event",Purpose,msa_2327894203
"Motivated by these two shortcomings , we propose a bi-level semantic representation analyzing method",Mechanism,msa_2327894203
"Regarding source-level , our method learns weights of semantic representation attained from different multimedia archives",Mechanism,msa_2327894203
"Meanwhile , it restrains the negative influence of noisy or irrelevant concepts in the overall concept-level",Mechanism,msa_2327894203
"In addition , we particularly focus on efficient multimedia event detection with few positive examples , which is highly appreciated in the real-world scenario",Mechanism,msa_2327894203
We perform extensive experiments on the challenging TRECVID MED 2013 and 2014 datasets,Method,msa_2327894203

"In multi-core systems , main memory is a major shared resource among processor cores",Background,msa_2332681365
A task running on one core can be delayed by other tasks running simultaneously on other cores due to interference in the shared main memory system,Background,msa_2332681365
"Such memory interference delay can be large and highly variable , thereby posing a significant challenge for the design of predictable real-time systems",Purpose,msa_2332681365
"In this paper , we present techniques",Mechanism,msa_2332681365
to reduce this interference and provide an upper bound on the worst-case interference,Purpose,msa_2332681365
on a multi-core platform that uses a commercial-off-the-shelf ( COTS ) DRAM system,Mechanism,msa_2332681365
"We explicitly model the major resources in the DRAM system , including banks , buses , and the memory controller",Mechanism,msa_2332681365
"By considering their timing characteristics , we analyze the worst-case memory interference delay imposed on a task by other tasks running in parallel",Method,msa_2332681365
"We find that memory interference can be significantly reduced by ( i ) partitioning DRAM banks , and ( ii ) co-locating memory-intensive tasks on the same processing core",Findings,msa_2332681365
"Based on these observations , we develop a memory interference-aware task allocation algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2332681365
for reducing memory interference,Purpose,msa_2332681365
We evaluate our approach on a COTS-based multi-core platform running Linux/RK,Method,msa_2332681365
Sustainable building system design techniques aim to find an optimal balance between occupant comfort and the energy performance of HVAC systems,Background,msa_2335268772
Design and implementation of effective heating ventilating and air conditioning ( HVAC ) controls is the key to achieve these optimal design conditions,Background,msa_2335268772
Any anomalies in the functioning of a system component or a control system would result in occupant discomfort and/or energy wastage,Background,msa_2335268772
"While occupant discomfort can be directly sensed by occupants , measurement of waste in energy use would require additional sensing and analysis infrastructure",Background,msa_2335268772
One way of identifying such a waste is to compare asdesigned system requirements with the actual performance of the systems,Background,msa_2335268772
This paper presents an analysis of an air handling unit ( AHU ) in a five story office building and provides the comparison results of design requirements against the sensor data corresponding to the AHU parameters,Purpose,msa_2335268772
One year sensor data for the AHU parameters was analyzed to assess the correctness of the implementation of the design intent,Method,msa_2335268772
"The design intent was interpreted from the sequence of operations ( SOOs ) and confirmed with a commissioning engineer , who worked on the project",Method,msa_2335268772
The design intent was then graphically represented as a pattern that the sensor data corresponding to the controls is expected to follow if it follows the design intent,Method,msa_2335268772
Any deviation in the sensor data as compared to the expected operation pattern of the design intent indicated incorrect operation of the system with incorrectly implemented controls,Findings,msa_2335268772
"Elucidating assembly pathways of complex macromolecular structures , such as virus capsids , is an important problem for understanding the many cellular processes dependent on self-assembly but also challenging given limited experimental technologies for observing such systems",Background,msa_2335298595
"We have previously addressed this problem through simulation-based data fitting , learning rate parameters of coarse-grained stochastic simulation models to match light scattering data from bulk assembly of purified coat protein in vitro providing an unprecedented view of the fine-scale reaction pathways that might have produced those data",Background,msa_2335298595
"A key question raised by such models , though , is how well they might reflect assembly under more natural cellular conditions where factors such as local concentration changes , non-specific crowding , and often the influence of nucleic acid during assembly become relevant",Purpose,msa_2335298595
"In the present study , we examine the latter issue , how",Purpose,msa_2335298595
using analytical models of various contributions of RNA folding to assembly,Mechanism,msa_2335298595
"would influence overall pathways and kinetics , primarily with reference to cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ( CCMV )",Purpose,msa_2335298595
We find a surprising complexity and synergy of interaction effects,Findings,msa_2335298595
"Energetic effects that gain or lower free energy tend to disrupt successful assembly relative to the in vitro model individually , while the full combination of positive and negative effects collectively promotes greatly accelerated assembly without loss of yield",Findings,msa_2335298595
"Furthermore , it accomplishes this change in kinetics while substantially altering the ensemble of assembly pathways open to the system",Findings,msa_2335298595

"Machine learning ( ML ) algorithms are commonly applied to big data , using distributed systems that partition the data across machines and allow each machine to read and update all ML model parameters -- - a strategy known as data parallelism",Background,msa_2335835108
"An alternative and complimentary strategy , model parallelism , partitions the model parameters for non-shared parallel access and updates , and may periodically repartition the parameters to facilitate communication",Background,msa_2335835108
"Model parallelism is motivated by two challenges that data-parallelism does not usually address : ( 1 ) parameters may be dependent , thus naive concurrent updates can introduce errors that slow convergence or even cause algorithm failure ; ( 2 ) model parameters converge at different rates , thus a small subset of parameters can bottleneck ML algorithm completion",Purpose,msa_2335835108
"We propose scheduled model parallelism ( SchMP ) , a programming approach",Mechanism,msa_2335835108
that improves ML algorithm convergence speed,Purpose,msa_2335835108
"by efficiently scheduling parameter updates , taking into account parameter dependencies and uneven convergence",Mechanism,msa_2335835108
"To support SchMP at scale , we develop a distributed framework STRADS which optimizes the throughput of SchMP programs , and benchmark four common ML applications written as SchMP programs : LDA topic modeling , matrix factorization , sparse least-squares ( Lasso ) regression and sparse logistic regression",Mechanism,msa_2335835108
By improving ML progress per iteration through SchMP programming whilst improving iteration throughput through STRADS,Mechanism,msa_2335835108
"Sequential games of perfect information can be solved by backward induction , where solutions to endgames are propagated up the game tree",Background,msa_2336208025
"However , this does not work in imperfect-information games because different endgames can contain states that belong to the same information set and can not be treated independently",Purpose,msa_2336208025
"In fact , we show that this approach can fail even in a simple game with a unique equilibrium and a single endgame",Purpose,msa_2336208025
"Nonetheless , we show that endgame solving can have significant benefits in imperfectinformation games with large state and action spaces : computation of exact ( rather than approximate ) equilibrium strategies , computation of relevant equilibrium refinements , significantly finer-grained action and information abstraction , new information abstraction algorithms that take into account the relevant distribution of players types entering the endgame , being able to select the coarseness of the action abstraction dynamically , additional abstraction techniques for speeding up endgame solving , a solution to the off-tree problem , and using different degrees of probability thresholding in modeling versus playing",Mechanism,msa_2336208025
"We discuss each of these topics in detail , and introduce techniques that enable one",Mechanism,msa_2336208025
to conduct endgame solving in a scalable way,Purpose,msa_2336208025

Privacy decision making has been examined from various perspectives,Background,msa_2336321440
A dominant normative perspective has focused on rational processes by which consumers with stable preferences for privacy weigh the expected benefits of privacy choices against their potential costs,Background,msa_2336321440
"More recently , an alternate behavioral perspective has leveraged theories from behavioral decision research to construe privacy decision making as a process in which cognitive heuristics and biases predictably occur",Background,msa_2336321440
"In a series of experiments ,",Method,msa_2336321440
we compare the predictive power of these two perspectives,Purpose,msa_2336321440
by evaluating the impact of changes in objective risk of disclosure and the impact of changes in relative perceptions of risk of disclosure on both hypothetical and actual consumer privacy choices,Method,msa_2336321440
"We find that both relative and objective risks can , in fact , impact consumer privacy decisions",Findings,msa_2336321440
"However , and surprisingly , the impact of objective changes in risk diminishes between hypothetical and actual choice settings",Findings,msa_2336321440
"Vice versa , the impact of relative risk is more pronounced going from hypothetical to actual choice settings",Findings,msa_2336321440
Communication and coordination play a major role in the ability of bacterial cells to adapt to ever changing environments and conditions,Background,msa_2336366762
Recent work has shown that such coordination underlies several aspects of bacterial responses including their ability to develop antibiotic resistance,Purpose,msa_2336366762
Here we develop a new distributed gradient descent method,Mechanism,msa_2336366762
that helps explain how bacterial cells collectively search for food in harsh environments using extremely limited communication and com- putational complexity,Purpose,msa_2336366762
This method can also be used for computational tasks when agents are facing similarly restricted conditions,Mechanism,msa_2336366762
We formalize the communication and computation assumptions re- quired for successful coordination and,Mechanism,msa_2336366762
prove that the method we propose leads to convergence even when using a dynamically changing interaction network,Findings,msa_2336366762
The proposed method improves upon prior models suggested for bacterial foraging despite making fewer assumptions,Mechanism,msa_2336366762

"ABSTRACT Clad steel refers to a thick carbon steel structural plate bonded to a corrosion resistant alloy ( CRA ) plate , such as stainless steel or titanium , and is widely used in industry to construct pressure vessels",Background,msa_2337209287
"The CRA resists the chemically aggressive environment on the interior , but can not prevent the development of corrosion losses and cracks that limit the continued safe operation of such vessels",Background,msa_2337209287
"At present there are no practical methods to detect such defects from the exposed outer surface of the thick carbon steel plate , often necessitating removing such vessels from service and inspecting them visually from the interior",Purpose,msa_2337209287
"In previous resear ch , sponsored by industry to detect and localize damage in pressurized piping systems under operational and environmental changes , we investigated a number of data-driven signal processing methods to extract damage information from ultrasonic guided wave pitch-catch records",Background,msa_2337209287
We now apply those methods to relatively large clad steel plate specimens,Mechanism,msa_2337209287
"We study a sparse array of wafer-type ultrasonic transducers adhered to the carbon steel surface , attempting to localize mass scatterers grease-coupled to the stainless steel surface",Method,msa_2337209287
"We discuss conditions under which localization is achieved by relatively simple first-arrival methods , and other conditions for which data-driven methods are needed",Findings,msa_2337209287
"Many commercial products and academic research activities are embracing behavior analysis as a technique for improving detection of attacks of many sortsfrom retweet boosting , hashtag hijacking to link advertising",Background,msa_2337240321
"Traditional approaches focus on detecting dense blocks in the adjacency matrix of graph data , and recently , the tensors of multimodal data",Background,msa_2337240321
No method gives a principled way to score the suspiciousness of dense blocks with different numbers of modes and rank them to draw human attention accordingly,Purpose,msa_2337240321
"In this paper , we first give a list of axioms that any metric of suspiciousness should satisfy ; we propose an intuitive , principled metric that satisfies the axioms , and is fast to compute ; moreover , we propose CrossSpot , an algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2337240321
"to spot dense blocks that are worth inspecting ,",Purpose,msa_2337240321
"typically indicating fraud or some other noteworthy deviation from the usual , and sort them in the order of importance ( suspiciousness )",Mechanism,msa_2337240321
"Finally , we apply CrossSpot to the real data ,",Method,msa_2337240321
Objective,Purpose,msa_2337325633
A traditional goal of neural recording with extracellular electrodes is to isolate action potential waveforms of an individual neuron,Background,msa_2337325633
"Recently , in braincomputer interfaces ( BCIs ) , it has been recognized that threshold crossing events of the voltage waveform also convey rich information",Background,msa_2337325633
"To date , the threshold for detecting threshold crossings has been selected to preserve single-neuron isolation",Background,msa_2337325633
"However , the optimal threshold for single-neuron identification is not necessarily the optimal threshold for information extraction",Purpose,msa_2337325633
Here we introduce a procedure,Mechanism,msa_2337325633
to determine the best threshold for extracting information from extracellular recordings,Purpose,msa_2337325633
"We apply this procedure in two distinct contexts : the encoding of kinematic parameters from neural activity in primary motor cortex ( M1 ) , and visual stimulus parameters from neural activity in primary visual cortex ( V1 )",Mechanism,msa_2337325633
Approach,Mechanism,msa_2337325633
We record extracellularly from multi-electrode arrays implanted in M1 or V1 in monkeys,Mechanism,msa_2337325633
"Then , we systematically sweep the voltage detection threshold and quantify the information conveyed by the corresponding threshold crossings",Mechanism,msa_2337325633
Main Results,Findings,msa_2337325633
The optimal threshold depends on the desired information,Findings,msa_2337325633
"In M1 , velocity is optimally encoded at higher thresholds than speed ; in both cases the optimal thresholds are lower than are typically used in BCI applications",Findings,msa_2337325633
"In V1 , information about the orientation of a visual stimulus is optimally encoded at higher thresholds than is visual contrast",Findings,msa_2337325633
A conceptual model explains these results as a consequence of cortical topography,Mechanism,msa_2337325633
"Although widely used , Multilinear PCA ( MPCA ) , one of the leading multilinear analysis methods , still suffers from four major drawbacks",Purpose,msa_2337719340
"First , it is very sensitive to outliers and noise",Purpose,msa_2337719340
"Second , it is unable to cope with missing values",Purpose,msa_2337719340
"Third , it is computationally expensive since MPCA deals with large multi-dimensional datasets",Purpose,msa_2337719340
"Finally , it is unable to maintain the local geometrical structures due to the averaging process",Purpose,msa_2337719340
This paper proposes a novel approach named Compressed Submanifold Multifactor Analysis ( CSMA ),Mechanism,msa_2337719340
to solve the four problems mentioned above,Purpose,msa_2337719340
Our approach can deal with the problem of missing values and outliers via SVD-L1,Mechanism,msa_2337719340
The Random Projection method is used to obtain the fast low-rank approximation of a given multifactor dataset,Mechanism,msa_2337719340
"In addition , it is able to preserve the geometry of the original data",Mechanism,msa_2337719340
"Our CSMA method can be used efficiently for multiple purposes , e",Mechanism,msa_2337719340
", noise and outlier removal , estimation of missing values , biometric applications",Mechanism,msa_2337719340
"We show that CSMA method can achieve good results and is very efficient in the inpainting problem as compared to [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]",Findings,msa_2337719340
Our method also achieves higher face recognition rates,Findings,msa_2337719340
"Consumer privacy decision making is often layered : different interrelated decisions determine , together , a final privacy outcome and its associated benefits and costs",Background,msa_2337976014
"Layered privacy choices are particularly common online , where consumers are frequently tasked with multiple , sequential choices ( such as first selecting a services privacy settings , and then engaging in privacy-sensitive behaviors ) that will ultimately impact their privacy trade-offs",Background,msa_2337976014
The layered nature of online privacy choices has important implications for models of privacy decision making and for consumers assumption of privacy risks,Purpose,msa_2337976014
"In this manuscript , we investigate how changes in the architecture of privacy choices affect an initial layer of privacy choice , and how that effect percolates through subsequent layers of privacy choices",Purpose,msa_2337976014
"Specifically , in a series of experiments , we investigate the impact of framing on participants initial privacy choices , and whether participants subsequent behaviors take account of , and neutralize , that impact",Method,msa_2337976014
"We find that various manipulations of decision frames , common to privacy contexts , can significantly alter individual choice of privacy protective options",Findings,msa_2337976014
"Further , and importantly , we find that participants subsequent disclosure behavior stays constant despite the shifts in chosen privacy protections induced by choice framing",Findings,msa_2337976014
"Motivation : As cancer researchers have come to appreciate the importance of intratumor heterogeneity , much attention has focused on the challenges of accurately profiling heterogeneity in individual patients",Background,msa_2338846226
"Experimental technologies for directly profiling genomes of single cells are rapidly improving , but they are still impractical for large-scale sampling",Background,msa_2338846226
"Bulk genomic assays remain the standard for population-scale studies , but conflate the influences of mixtures of genetically distinct tumor , stromal , and infiltrating immune cells",Background,msa_2338846226
Many computational approaches have been developed to deconvolute these mixed samples and reconstruct the genomics of genetically homogeneous clonal subpopulations,Background,msa_2338846226
"All such methods , however , are limited to reconstructing only coarse approximations to a few major subpopulations",Background,msa_2338846226
"In prior work , we showed that one can improve deconvolution of genomic data by leveraging substructure in cellular mixtures through a strategy called simplicial complex inference",Background,msa_2338846226
"This strategy , however , is also limited by the difficulty of inferring mixture structure from sparse , noisy assays",Purpose,msa_2338846226
Results :,Findings,msa_2338846226
We improve on past work,Purpose,msa_2338846226
"by introducing enhancements to automate learning of substructured genomic mixtures , with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy number variation ( CNV ) data",Mechanism,msa_2338846226

The pervasiveness of mobile technologies today have facilitated the creation of massive crowdsourced and geotagged data from individual users in real time and at different locations in the city,Background,msa_2338895451
"Such ubiquitous user-generated data allow us to infer various patterns of human behavior , which help us understand the interactions between humans and cities",Background,msa_2338895451
"In this study , we focus on understanding users economic behavior in the city by examining the economic value from crowdsourced and geotaggged data",Purpose,msa_2338895451

"Effective enforcement of laws and policies requires expending resources to prevent and detect offenders , as well as appropriate punishment schemes to deter violators",Background,msa_2339370002
"In particular , enforcement of privacy laws and policies in modern organizations that hold large volumes of personal information ( e",Background,msa_2339370002

Admixture-introduced linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) has recently been introduced into the inference of the histories of complex admixtures,Background,msa_2339614305
"However , the influence of ancestral source populations on the LD pattern in admixed populations is not properly taken into consideration by currently available methods , which affects the estimation of several gene flow parameters from empirical data",Purpose,msa_2339614305
We first illustrated the dynamic changes of LD in admixed populations and mathematically formulated the LD under a generalized admixture model with finite population size,Mechanism,msa_2339614305
"We next developed a new method , MALDmef , by fitting LD with multiple exponential functions for inferring and dating multiple-wave admixtures",Mechanism,msa_2339614305
"MALDmef takes into account the effects of source populations which substantially affect modeling LD in admixed population , which renders it capable of efficiently detecting and dating multiple-wave admixture events",Mechanism,msa_2339614305
The performance of MALDmef was evaluated by simulation,Method,msa_2339614305
"and it was shown to be more accurate than MALDER , a state-of-the-art method that was recently developed for similar purposes , under various admixture models",Findings,msa_2339614305
We further applied MALDmef to analyzing genome-wide data from the Human Genome Diversity Project ( HGDP ) and the HapMap Project,Method,msa_2339614305
"Interestingly , we were able to identify more than one admixture events in several populations , which have yet to be reported",Findings,msa_2339614305

"In an African population ( MKK ) , three recent major admixtures occurring 13 ? ? ? 16 , 50 ? ? ? 67 , and 107 ? ? ? 139 generations ago were detected",Findings,msa_2339614305
Large-scale deep learning requires huge computational resources to train a multi-layer neural network,Background,msa_2339765813
Recent systems propose using 100s to 1000s of machines to train networks with tens of layers and billions of connections,Background,msa_2339765813
"While the computation involved can be done more efficiently on GPUs than on more traditional CPU cores , training such networks on a single GPU is too slow and training on distributed GPUs can be inefficient , due to data movement overheads , GPU stalls , and limited GPU memory",Purpose,msa_2339765813

T cells must receive signals through the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and the costimulatory receptor CD28 to become fully activated,Background,msa_2342193534
"Critical to this process is the reorganization of plasma membrane actin at the immunological synapse , the interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell",Purpose,msa_2342193534
Roybal et al,Mechanism,msa_2342193534
imaged actin and fluorescently tagged actin regulatory proteins in T cells activated through the TCR in the absence or presence of CD28 signaling,Mechanism,msa_2342193534
Computational image processing to normalize differences in cell shape enabled tracking of the fluorescent proteins,Mechanism,msa_2342193534
The regulatory proteins WAVE2 and cofilin were efficiently recruited to the immunological synapse only when both TCR and CD28 signaled,Findings,msa_2342193534
Constitutive activation of either protein in TCR-stimulated T cells enabled normal actin reorganization even when CD28 signaling was blocked,Findings,msa_2342193534
A grand challenge for state estimation in newly built smart grid lies in how to deal with the increasing uncertainties,Purpose,msa_2342408507
"To solve the problem ,",Purpose,msa_2342408507
"we propose a data-driven state estimation approach based on recent targeted investment on sensors , data storage , and computing devices",Mechanism,msa_2342408507
"An architecture is proposed to use power system physics and pattern to systematically clean historical data and conduct supervised learning , where historical similar measurements and their states are used to learn the relationship between the current measurement and the state",Mechanism,msa_2342408507
"In order to deal with nonlinearity , kernel trick is used to produce linear mapping in a carefully selected higher dimensional space",Mechanism,msa_2342408507
"To speed up the data-driven approach for online services , we analyze power system data set and discover its clustering property due to the periodic pattern of power systems",Mechanism,msa_2342408507
"This leads to significant dimension reduction and the idea of preorganizing data points in a tree structure for inquiry , leading to 1000 times speedup",Mechanism,msa_2342408507

Multi-person tracking plays a critical role in the analysis of surveillance video,Background,msa_2343233340
"However , most existing work focus on shorter-term ( e",Purpose,msa_2343233340
g,Purpose,msa_2343233340
minute-long or hour-long ) video sequences,Purpose,msa_2343233340
"Therefore , we propose a multi-person tracking algorithm for very long-term ( e",Mechanism,msa_2343233340

month-long ) multi-camera surveillance scenarios,Mechanism,msa_2343233340
Long-term tracking is challenging because 1 ) the apparel/appearance of the same person will vary greatly over multiple days and 2 ) a person will leave and re-enter the scene numerous times,Mechanism,msa_2343233340
"To tackle these challenges , we leverage face recognition information , which is robust to apparel change , to automatically reinitialize our tracker over multiple days of recordings",Mechanism,msa_2343233340
"Unfortunately , recognized faces are unavailable oftentimes",Mechanism,msa_2343233340
"Therefore , our tracker propagates identity information to frames without recognized faces by uncovering the appearance and spatial manifold formed by person detections",Mechanism,msa_2343233340
"We tested our algorithm on a 23-day 15-camera data set ( 4,935 hours total ) ,",Method,msa_2343233340
and we were able to localize a person 53,Findings,msa_2343233340

"Cyber-physical systems ( CPS ) are heterogeneous , be- cause they tightly couple computation , communication , and control along with physical dynamics , which are traditionally considered separately",Background,msa_2343525901
"Without a comprehensive modeling formalism , model- based development of CPS involves using a multitude of models in a variety of formalisms that capture various aspects of the system design , such as software design , networking design , physical mod- els , and protocol design",Background,msa_2343525901
"Without a rigorous unifying framework , system integration and integration of the analysis results for vari- ous models remains ad hoc",Purpose,msa_2343525901
"In this paper , we propose a multi-view architecture framework that treats models as views of the under- lying system structure and uses structural and semantic mappings",Mechanism,msa_2343525901
to ensure consistency and enable system-level verification in a hierarchical and compositional manner,Purpose,msa_2343525901
"Throughout the paper , the theoretical concepts are illustrated using two examples : a quad- rotor and an automotive intersection collision avoidance system",Method,msa_2343525901
"In this paper , we introduce InstructableCrowd , a system",Mechanism,msa_2346018686
"that allows end-users to instruct the crowd to create trigger-action ( `` if , then '' ) rules based on their needs",Purpose,msa_2346018686
The maximum Nash welfare ( MNW ) solution -- - which selects an allocation that maximizes the product of utilities -- - is known to provide outstanding fairness guarantees when allocating divisible goods,Background,msa_2346164124
"And while it seems to lose its luster when applied to indivisible goods , we show that , in fact , the MNW solution is unexpectedly , strikingly fair even in that setting",Mechanism,msa_2346164124
"In particular , we prove that it selects allocations that are envy free up to one good -- - a compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency",Purpose,msa_2346164124
"We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular ( yet possibly infeasible ) fairness property , the maximin share guarantee , in theory and -- - even more so -- - in practice",Mechanism,msa_2346164124
"While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard , we develop a nontrivial implementation , and",Mechanism,msa_2346164124
demonstrate that it scales well,Findings,msa_2346164124

The safety of mobile robots in dynamic environments is predicated on making sure that they do not collide with obstacles,Background,msa_2346648140

"Given a bipartite graph of users and the products that they review , or followers and followees , how can we detect fake reviews or follows ? Existing fraud detection methods ( spectral , etc",Background,msa_2348679751
) try to identify dense subgraphs of nodes that are sparsely connected to the remaining graph,Background,msa_2348679751
"Fraudsters can evade these methods using camouflage , by adding reviews or follows with honest targets so that they look `` normal ''",Background,msa_2348679751
"Even worse , some fraudsters use hijacked accounts from honest users , and then the camouflage is indeed organic",Background,msa_2348679751
Our focus is to spot fraudsters in the presence of camouflage or hijacked accounts,Purpose,msa_2348679751
"We propose FRAUDAR , an algorithm that ( a ) is camouflage-resistant , ( b ) provides upper bounds on the effectiveness of fraudsters , and",Mechanism,msa_2348679751

Experimental results under various attacks,Method,msa_2348679751
show that FRAUDAR outperforms the top competitor in accuracy of detecting both camouflaged and non-camouflaged fraud,Findings,msa_2348679751

Abstract : We study the emergence of global behavior in large scale networks,Purpose,msa_236374836
"The underlying motivating application is epidemics like computer virus spreading , for example , in wide campus local networks",Background,msa_236374836
"We consider multiple classes of viruses , each type bearing their own statistical characterization -- exogenous contamination , contagious propagation , and healing",Mechanism,msa_236374836
"The network state ( distribution of nodes infected by each class in the network ) is a jump Markov process , not necessarily reversible , making it a challenge to obtain its invariant distribution",Mechanism,msa_236374836
"By suitable renormalization , in the limit of a large network ( number of nodes ) , we describe the macroscopic or emergent behavior of the network by the solution of a set of deterministic nonlinear differential equations",Mechanism,msa_236374836
These nonlinear differential equations are obtained by mean field analysis of the microscopic random dynamics,Mechanism,msa_236374836
The ubiquitous deployment of mobile and sensor technologies has led to both the capacity to observe human behavior in physical ( offline ) settings as well as to record it,Background,msa_2364071307
This provides researchers with a new lens to study and better understand the individual decision processes that were previously unobserved,Purpose,msa_2364071307
"In this paper , we study decision making behavior of 11,196 taxi drivers in a large Asian city using a rich data set consisting of 10",Method,msa_2364071307
6 million fine-grained GPS trip records,Method,msa_2364071307
"These records include detailed taxi GPS trajectories , taxi occupancy data ( i",Method,msa_2364071307
", whether a taxi was occupied with a passenger or was vacant ) and taxi drivers daily incomes",Method,msa_2364071307
This capacity to use data where occupancy of the taxi is known is a distinctive feature of our data set and sets this work apart from prior work which has attempted to study driver behavior,Mechanism,msa_2364071307
The specific decision we focus on pertains to actions drivers take to find new passengers after they have dropped off their current passengers,Method,msa_2364071307
"In particular , we study the role of information derivable from the GPS trace data ( e",Method,msa_2364071307
", where passengers are dropped off , where passengers are picked up , longitudinal taxicab travel history with fine-grained time stamps ) observable by or made available to drivers in enabling them to learn the distribution of demand for their services over space and time",Method,msa_2364071307
We conduct our study using a heterogeneous Bayesian learning model,Mechanism,msa_2364071307
"We find strong heterogeneity in individual learning behavior and driving decisions , which is significantly associated with individual economic outcomes",Findings,msa_2364071307
"Drivers with higher incomes benefit significantly from their ability to learn from not only demand information directly observable in the local market , but also aggregate information on demand flows across markets",Findings,msa_2364071307
"Interestingly , our policy simulations indicate information that is noisy at the individual level becomes valuable after being aggregated across various spatial and temporal dimensions",Findings,msa_2364071307
"Moreover , the value of information does not increase monotonically with the scale and frequency of information sharing",Findings,msa_2364071307

"We present AD3 , a new algorithm",Mechanism,msa_237364718
for approximate maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) inference on factor graphs,Purpose,msa_237364718
", based on the alternating directions method of multipliers",Mechanism,msa_237364718
"Like other dual decomposition algorithms , AD3 has a modular architecture , where local subproblems are solved independently , and their solutions are gathered to compute a global update",Mechanism,msa_237364718
"The key characteristic of AD3 is that each local subproblem has a quadratic regularizer , leading to faster convergence , both theoretically and in practice",Mechanism,msa_237364718
We provide closed-form solutions for these AD3 subproblems for binary pairwise factors and factors imposing first-order logic constraints,Mechanism,msa_237364718
"For arbitrary factors ( large or combinatorial ) , we introduce an active set method which requires only an oracle for computing a local MAP configuration , making AD3 applicable to a wide range of problems",Mechanism,msa_237364718

"What is the growth pattern of social networks , like Facebook and WeChat ? Does it truly exhibit exponential early growth , as predicted by textbook models like the Bass model , SI , or the Branching Process ? How about the count of links , over time , for which there are few published models ?",Purpose,msa_2377801650
"We examine the growth of several real networks , including one of the world 's largest online social network , `` WeChat '' , with 300 million nodes and 4",Method,msa_2377801650
75 billion links by 2013,Method,msa_2377801650
"; and we observe power law growth for both nodes and links , a fact that completely breaks the sigmoid models ( like SI , and Bass )",Findings,msa_2377801650
"In its place , we propose NETTIDE , along with differential equations for the growth of the count of nodes , as well as links",Mechanism,msa_2377801650
"Our model accurately fits the growth patterns of real graphs ; it is general , encompassing as special cases all the known , traditional models ( including Bass , SI , log-logistic growth ) ; while still remaining parsimonious , requiring only a handful of parameters",Mechanism,msa_2377801650
"Moreover , our NETTIDE for link growth is the first one of its kind , accurately fitting real data , and naturally leading to the densification phenomenon",Mechanism,msa_2377801650

addresses,,msa_2382774675
the,,msa_2382774675
aforementioned,,msa_2382774675
challenges,,msa_2382774675
We,,msa_2382774675

because,,msa_2382774675
it,,msa_2382774675
is,,msa_2382774675
simple,,msa_2382774675
enough,,msa_2382774675
to,,msa_2382774675
"How do social groups , such as Facebook groups and Wechat groups , dynamically evolve over time ? How do people join the social groups , uniformly or with burst ? What is the pattern of people quitting from groups ? Is there a simple universal model to depict the come-and-go patterns of various groups ?",Purpose,msa_2389589064
"In this paper , we examine temporal evolution patterns of more than 100 thousands social groups with more than 10 million users",Method,msa_2389589064
We surprisingly find that the evolution patterns of real social groups goes far beyond the classic dynamic models like SI and SIR,Findings,msa_2389589064
"For example , we observe both diffusion and non-diffusion mechanism in the group joining process , and power-law decay in group quitting process , rather than exponential decay as expected in SIR model",Findings,msa_2389589064
"Therefore we propose a new model comeNgo , a concise yet flexible dynamic model",Mechanism,msa_2389589064
for group evolution,Purpose,msa_2389589064
"System management includes the selection of maintenance actions depending on the available observations : when a system is made up by components known to be similar , data collected on one is also relevant for the management of others",Background,msa_2390735409
"This is typically the case of wind farms , which are made up by similar turbines",Background,msa_2390735409
"Optimal management of wind farms is an important task due to high cost of turbines operation and maintenance : in this context , we recently proposed a method for planning and learning at system-level , called PLUS , built upon the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process ( POMDP ) framework , which treats transition and emission probabilities as random variables , and is therefore suitable for including model uncertainty",Background,msa_2390735409
PLUS models the components as independent or identical,Purpose,msa_2390735409
"In this paper , we extend that formulation , allowing for a weaker similarity among components",Purpose,msa_2390735409
"The proposed approach , called Multiple Uncertain POMDP ( MU-POMDP ) , models the components as POMDPs , and assumes the corresponding parameters as dependent random variables",Mechanism,msa_2390735409
"Through this framework , we can calibrate specific degradation and emission models for each component while , at the same time , process observations at system-level",Mechanism,msa_2390735409
"We compare the performance of the proposed MU-POMDP with PLUS ,",Method,msa_2390735409
Representing and summarizing human behaviors with rich contexts facilitates behavioral sciences and user-oriented services,Background,msa_2391440061
"Traditional behavioral modeling represents a behavior as a tuple in which each element is one contextual factor of one type , and the tensor-based summaries look for high-order dense blocks by clustering the values ( including timestamps ) in each dimension",Background,msa_2391440061
"However , the human behaviors are multicontextual and dynamic : ( 1 ) each behavior takes place within multiple contexts in a few dimensions , which requires the representation to enable non-value and set-values for each dimension ; ( 2 ) many behavior collections , such as tweets or papers , evolve over time",Purpose,msa_2391440061
"In this paper ,",Mechanism,msa_2391440061
we represent the behavioral data,Purpose,msa_2391440061
as a two-level matrix ( temporal-behaviors by dimensional-values ) and propose a novel representation,Mechanism,msa_2391440061
for behavioral summary,Purpose,msa_2391440061
"called Tartan that includes a set of dimensions , the values in each dimension , a list of consecutive time slices and the behaviors in each slice",Mechanism,msa_2391440061
We further develop a propagation method CatchTartan,Mechanism,msa_2391440061
to catch the dynamic multicontextual patterns from the temporal multidimensional data in a principled and scalable way :,Purpose,msa_2391440061
it determines the meaningfulness of updating every element in the Tartan by minimizing the encoding cost in a compression manner,Mechanism,msa_2391440061
CatchTartan outperforms the baselines on both the accuracy and speed,Findings,msa_2391440061
We apply CatchTartan to four Twitter datasets up to 10 million tweets and the DBLP data,Method,msa_2391440061
"In this paper , we address the distributed filtering and prediction of time-varying random fields represented by linear time-invariant ( LTI ) dynamical systems",Purpose,msa_2395240417
The field is observed by a sparsely connected network of agents/sensors collaborating among themselves,Method,msa_2395240417
We develop a Kalman filter type consensus + innovations distributed linear estimator of the dynamic field termed as Consensus+Innovations Kalman Filter,Mechanism,msa_2395240417
We analyze the convergence properties of this distributed estimator,Method,msa_2395240417
We prove that the mean-squared error of the estimator asymptotically converges if the degree of instability of the field dynamics is within a prespecified threshold defined as tracking capacity of the estimator,Findings,msa_2395240417
The tracking capacity is a function of the local observation models and the agent communication network,Findings,msa_2395240417
We design the optimal consensus and innovation gain matrices,Mechanism,msa_2395240417
yielding distributed estimates with minimized mean-squared error,Findings,msa_2395240417

"In this report , we describe CMU-SMUs participation in the Video Hyperlinking task of TRECVID 2015",Background,msa_2395481004
We treat video hyperlinking as ad-hoc retrieval scenario and use a variety of retrieval methods,Mechanism,msa_2395481004
"Our experiments mainly focus on the study of different features on the performance of video hyperlinking , including subtitle , metadata , audio and visual features , as well as the consideration of surrounding context",Purpose,msa_2395481004
Different combination strategies are used to combine those features,Mechanism,msa_2395481004
"Besides , we also attempt to categorize the queries and use different search strategies for different categories",Mechanism,msa_2395481004

The physical constraints of smartwatches limit the range and complexity of tasks that can be completed,Background,msa_2396078445
"Despite interface improvements on smartwatches , the promise of enabling productive work remains largely unrealized",Purpose,msa_2396078445
"This paper presents WearWrite , a system that enables",Mechanism,msa_2396078445
users to write documents from their smartwatches,Purpose,msa_2396078445
by leveraging a crowd to help translate their ideas into text,Mechanism,msa_2396078445
"WearWrite users dictate tasks , respond to questions , and receive notifications of major edits on their watch",Mechanism,msa_2396078445
"Using a dynamic task queue , the crowd receives tasks issued by the watch user and generic tasks from the system",Mechanism,msa_2396078445
In a week-long study with seven smartwatch users supported by approximately 29 crowd workers each,Method,msa_2396078445
", we validate that it is possible to manage the crowd writing process from a watch",Findings,msa_2396078445
Watch users captured new ideas as they came to mind and managed a crowd during spare moments while going about their daily routine,Mechanism,msa_2396078445
We present a new algorithmic approach,Mechanism,msa_2396773777
"to the group fused lasso , a convex model that approximates a multi-dimensional signal via an approximately piecewise-constant signal",Purpose,msa_2396773777
"This model has found many applications in multiple change point detection , signal compression , and total variation denoising , though existing algorithms typically using first-order or alternating minimization schemes",Mechanism,msa_2396773777
"In this paper we instead develop a specialized projected Newton method , combined with a primal active set approach , which we show to be substantially faster that existing methods",Mechanism,msa_2396773777
"Furthermore , we present two applications that use this algorithm as a fast subroutine for a more complex outer loop : segmenting linear regression models for time series data , and color image denoising",Mechanism,msa_2396773777
Crowdsourced clustering approaches present a promising way to harness deep semantic knowledge for clustering complex information,Background,msa_2398018337
"However , existing approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers to generate meaningful categories , and are costly because all items require human judgments",Purpose,msa_2398018337
SkinTrack is a wearable system,Mechanism,msa_2400840826
that enables continuous touch tracking on the skin,Purpose,msa_2400840826
"It consists of a ring , which emits a continuous high frequency AC signal , and a sensing wristband with multiple electrodes",Mechanism,msa_2400840826
"Due to the phase delay inherent in a high-frequency AC signal propagating through the body , a phase difference can be observed between pairs of electrodes",Mechanism,msa_2400840826
SkinTrack measures these phase differences to compute a 2D finger touch coordinate,Mechanism,msa_2400840826
"Our approach can segment touch events at 99 % accuracy , and resolve the 2D location of touches with a mean error of 7",Findings,msa_2400840826

Strong Nash equilibrium ( SNE ) is an appealing solution concept when rational agents can form coalitions,Background,msa_2402207037
A strategy profile is an SNE if no coalition of agents can benefit by deviating,Background,msa_2402207037
We present the first general-purpose algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2402207037
for SNE finding in games with more than two agents,Purpose,msa_2402207037
An SNE must simultaneously be a Nash equilibrium ( NE ) and the optimal solution of multiple non-convex optimization problems,Mechanism,msa_2402207037
This makes even the derivation of necessary and sufficient mathematical equilibrium constraints difficult,Mechanism,msa_2402207037
"We show that forcing an SNE to be resilient only to pure-strategy deviations by coalitions , unlike for NEs , is only a necessary condition here",Mechanism,msa_2402207037
"Second , we show that the application of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions leads to another set of necessary conditions that are not sufficient",Mechanism,msa_2402207037
"Third , we show that forcing the Pareto efficiency of an SNE for each coalition with respect to coalition correlated strategies is sufficient but not necessary",Mechanism,msa_2402207037
We then develop a tree search algorithm for SNE finding,Mechanism,msa_2402207037
"At each node , it calls an oracle to suggest a candidate SNE and then verifies the candidate",Mechanism,msa_2402207037
We show that our new necessary conditions can be leveraged to make the oracle more powerful,Mechanism,msa_2402207037
Experiments,Method,msa_2402207037
How can we predict Smith 's main hobby if we know the main hobby of Smith 's friends ? Can we measure the confidence in our predic- tion if we are given the main hobby of only a few of Smith 's friends ?,Background,msa_2402589876
"In this paper , we focus on how to estimate the confidence on the node classi- fication problem",Purpose,msa_2402589876
"Providing a confidence level for the classification prob- lem is important because most nodes in real world networks tend to have few neighbors , and thus , a small amount of evidence",Mechanism,msa_2402589876
"Our contributions are three-fold : ( a ) novel algorithm ; we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm that converges fast , and provides the confidence estimate",Mechanism,msa_2402589876
( b ) theoretical analysis ; we show the solid theoretical foundation of our algo- rithm and the connections to label propagation and Bayesian inference ( c ) empirical analysis ; we perform extensive experiments on three dif- ferent real networks,Method,msa_2402589876

"Given their large energy footprints and the availability of building energy management systems , airports are uniquely positioned to take advantage of demand response ( DR ) programs",Background,msa_2402873305
"Although a baselinethe estimation of what the load would have been without load reductionis essential to assess the performance of DR strategies , there has been very little published research on developing baselines for airports",Purpose,msa_2402873305
"Therefore , the research described in this paper aims to develop baseline models specially intended for airport facilities",Purpose,msa_2402873305
"Specifically , the authors propose piece-wise linear regression models",Mechanism,msa_2402873305
"for predicting electricity demand using time-of-week , temperature , and flight schedule information",Purpose,msa_2402873305
"For the given period of April and May ,",Method,msa_2402873305
"test results reveals that a model , which has trained over specific seasonal data with only time-of-week and temperature as inputs , has the best prediction performance",Findings,msa_2402873305
"The number of passengers of departure flight schedules is shown to have a positive relationship to the load , but does not improve the model accuracy significantly",Findings,msa_2402873305
"However , since this study is done for the spring season , when heating , ventilating , and air conditioning ( HVAC ) systems run the least , the results may not represent other seasons with high cooling or heating demand",Findings,msa_2402873305
"The fair division of indivisible goods has long been an important topic in economics and , more recently , computer science",Background,msa_2403056628
"We investigate the existence of envyfree allocations of indivisible goods ,",Mechanism,msa_2403056628
"that is , allocations where each player values her own allocated set of goods at least as highly as any other player 's allocated set of goods",Purpose,msa_2403056628
"Under additive valuations ,",Method,msa_2403056628
"we show that even when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a linear fraction , envy-free allocations are unlikely to exist",Findings,msa_2403056628
"We then show that when the number of goods is larger by a logarithmic factor , such allocations exist with high probability",Findings,msa_2403056628

"Non-Technical Loss ( NTL ) represents a major challenge when providing reliable electrical service in developing countries , where it often accounts for 11-15 % of total generation capacity [ 1 ]",Background,msa_2404640867
"NTL is caused by a variety of factors such as theft , unmetered homes , and inability to pay , which at volume can lead to system instability , grid failure , and major financial losses for providers",Background,msa_2404640867
"In this paper , we investigate error sources and techniques",Mechanism,msa_2404640867
for separating NTL from total losses in microgrids,Purpose,msa_2404640867
We adopt and compare two classes of approaches for detecting NTL : ( 1 ) model- driven and ( 2 ) data- driven,Method,msa_2404640867
"The model-driven class considers the primary sources of state uncertainty including line losses , meter consumption , meter calibration error , packet loss , and sample synchronization error",Mechanism,msa_2404640867
"In the data-driven class , we use two approaches that learn grid state based on training data",Mechanism,msa_2404640867
The first approach uses a regression technique on an NTL-free period of grid operation to capture the relationship between state error and total consumption,Mechanism,msa_2404640867
The second approach uses an SVM trained on synthetic NTL data,Mechanism,msa_2404640867
Both classes of approaches can provide a confidence interval based on the amount of detected NTL,Findings,msa_2404640867
"We experimentally evaluate and compare the approaches on wireless meter data collected from a 525-home microgrid deployed in Les Anglais , Haiti",Method,msa_2404640867
"We see that both are quite effective , but that the data-driven class is significantly easier to implement",Findings,msa_2404640867
Kidney exchanges are organized markets where patients swap willing but incompatible donors,Background,msa_2404842920
"In the last decade , kidney exchanges grew from small and regional to large and national -- -and soon , international",Background,msa_2404842920
"This growth results in more lives saved , but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the $ \mathcal { NP } $ -complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors",Background,msa_2404842920
"State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear fielded kidney exchanges , but these methods must be tailored to specific models and objective functions , and may fail to scale to larger exchanges",Purpose,msa_2404842920
"In this paper , we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes ,",Mechanism,msa_2404842920
the clearing problem is solvable in polynomial time,Purpose,msa_2404842920
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary compatibility graph,Mechanism,msa_2404842920
"Then , using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange , we show how many attributes are needed to encode real compatibility graphs",Mechanism,msa_2404842920
The experiments,Method,msa_2404842920
Friendsourcing consists of broadcasting questions and help requests to friends on social networking sites,Background,msa_2405576963
"Despite its potential value , friendsourcing requests often fall on deaf ears",Purpose,msa_2405576963
"One way to improve response rates and motivate friends to undertake more effortful tasks may be to offer extrinsic rewards , such as money or a gift , for responding to friendsourcing requests",Purpose,msa_2405576963
"However , past research suggests that these extrinsic rewards can have unintended consequences , including undermining intrinsic motivations and undercutting the relationship between people",Purpose,msa_2405576963
"To explore the effects of extrinsic reward on friends ' response rate and perceived relationship ,",Purpose,msa_2405576963
we conducted an experiment on a new friendsourcing platform - Mobilyzr,Method,msa_2405576963

Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work,Background,msa_2406037548
"However , real world tasks are often interdependent , requiring a big picture view of the difference pieces involved",Purpose,msa_2406037548
Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are bottlenecked by relying on a small number of individuals to maintain the big picture,Purpose,msa_2406037548
"In this paper , we explore the idea that a computational system can scaffold an emerging interdependent , big picture view entirely through the small contributions of individuals , each of whom sees only a part of the whole",Mechanism,msa_2406037548
"To investigate the viability , strengths , and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis and evaluate its output across a variety of topics",Method,msa_2406037548
"We investigate synergy , or lack thereof , between agents in co-operative games , building on the popular notion of Shapley value",Purpose,msa_2406209768
We think of a pair of agents as synergistic ( resp,Mechanism,msa_2406209768
", antagonistic ) if the Shapley value of one agent when the other agent participates in a joint effort is higher ( resp",Mechanism,msa_2406209768
lower ) than when the other agent does not participate,Mechanism,msa_2406209768
Our main theoretical result is that any graph specifying synergistic and antagonistic pairs can arise even from a restricted class of cooperative games,Findings,msa_2406209768
We also study the computational complexity of determining whether a given pair of agents is synergistic,Mechanism,msa_2406209768
How do users behave if they can tag each other in social networks ?,Background,msa_2406344041
"In this paper , we answer this question by studying the interactive tagging network constructed by Twitter lists",Purpose,msa_2406344041
Twitter lists can be regarded as the tagging process ; a user ( i,Background,msa_2406344041
", tagger ) creates a list with a name ( i",Background,msa_2406344041
", tag ) and adds other users ( i",Background,msa_2406344041
", tagged users ) into the list",Background,msa_2406344041
This tagging network is by nature different from the resource tagging networks ( e,Background,msa_2406344041
", Flickr and Delicious ) because users on this network can tag each other",Background,msa_2406344041
"We address the following research questions : ( RQ1 ) What is the common patterns and the difference between the interactive tagging network and the resource tagging networks ? ( RQ2 ) Do users tag each other on the interactive tagging network ? And if so , to what extent ? ( RQ3 ) What is the difference between the two types of relationships on Twitter : who-tags-whom and who-follows-whom ?",Purpose,msa_2406344041
"By quantitatively studying million-scale networks ,",Method,msa_2406344041
"we found the pervasive patterns across the different tagging networks , and the interactive patterns within the interactive tagging network",Findings,msa_2406344041
Social media is an increasingly important part of modern life,Background,msa_2406390611
"We investigate the use of and usability of Twitter by blind users ,",Purpose,msa_2406390611
"via a combination of surveys of blind Twitter users , large-scale analysis of tweets from and Twitter profiles of blind and sighted users , and analysis of tweets containing embedded imagery",Method,msa_2406390611
"While Twitter has traditionally been thought of as the most accessible social media platform for blind users , Twitter 's increasing integration of image content and users ' diverse uses for images have presented emergent accessibility challenges",Purpose,msa_2406390611
"Our findings illuminate the importance of the ability to use social media for people who are blind , while also highlighting the many challenges such media currently present this user base , including difficulty in creating profiles , in awareness of available features and settings , in controlling revelations of one 's disability status , and in dealing with the increasing pervasiveness of image-based content",Findings,msa_2406390611

We focus on detecting complex events in unconstrained Internet videos,Purpose,msa_2407145437
"While most existing works rely on the abundance of labeled training data , we consider a more difficult zero-shot setting where no training data is supplied",Purpose,msa_2407145437
We first pre-train a number of concept classifiers using data from other sources,Mechanism,msa_2407145437
Then we evaluate the semantic correlation of each concept w,Mechanism,msa_2407145437
t,Mechanism,msa_2407145437
the event of interest,Mechanism,msa_2407145437
"After further refinement to take prediction inaccuracy and discriminative power into account , we apply the discovered concept classifiers on all test videos and obtain multiple score vectors",Mechanism,msa_2407145437
These distinct score vectors are converted into pairwise comparison matrices and the nuclear norm rank aggregation framework is adopted to seek consensus,Mechanism,msa_2407145437
"To address the challenging optimization formulation ,",Purpose,msa_2407145437

"We introduce disciplined convex stochastic programming ( DCSP ) , a modeling framework",Mechanism,msa_2407287065
that can significantly lower the barrier for modelers to specify and solve convex stochastic optimization problems,Purpose,msa_2407287065
", by allowing modelers to naturally express a wide variety of convex stochastic programs in a manner that reflects their underlying mathematical representation",Mechanism,msa_2407287065
"DCSP allows modelers to express expectations of arbitrary expressions , partial optimizations , and chance constraints across a wide variety of convex optimization problem families ( e",Mechanism,msa_2407287065
", linear , quadratic , second order cone , and semidefinite programs )",Mechanism,msa_2407287065
Nudging behaviors through user interface design is a practice that is well-studied in HCI research,Background,msa_2407481741
Corporations often use this knowledge to modify online interfaces to influence user information disclosure,Background,msa_2407481741
"In this paper , we experimentally test",Method,msa_2407481741
the impact of a norm-shaping design patterns on information divulging behavior,Purpose,msa_2407481741
"We show that ( 1 ) a set of images , biased toward more revealing figures , change subjects ' personal views of appropriate information to share ; ( 2 ) that shifts in perceptions significantly increases the probability that a subject divulges personal information ; and ( 3 ) that these shift also increases the probability that the subject advises others to do so",Findings,msa_2407481741

A computationally tractable algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2407871596
for estimating the graph adjacency matrix of this model,Purpose,msa_2407871596
from observed time series data is presented,Mechanism,msa_2407871596
The performance guarantees of this algorithm for prediction are outlined under several assumptions on the properties of the dynamics of the system of agents and on the true values of the parameters,Mechanism,msa_2407871596
"Finding densely connected subgraphs , also called communities , in networks are of interest for many applications",Background,msa_2408032375
"In previous work , we showed an optimization method for efficiently finding subgraphs denser than the overall network [ 1 ]",Background,msa_2408032375
"This result is derived from our studies of network processes , dynamical processes that model interactions between individual agents in networks ( i",Background,msa_2408032375
", spread of infection or cascading failures )",Background,msa_2408032375
"In this paper , we prove",Purpose,msa_2408032375
that these subgraphs,Mechanism,msa_2408032375
are also unique,Purpose,msa_2408032375
In this paper we provide faster algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2410099853
for solving the geometric median problem : given n points in d compute a point that minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances to the points,Purpose,msa_2410099853
This is one of the oldest non-trivial problems in computational geometry yet despite a long history of research the previous fastest running times for computing a ( 1+ ) -approximate geometric median were O ( d n 4/3 8/3 ) by Chin et,Background,msa_2410099853

In this paper we show how to compute such an approximate geometric median in time O ( nd log 3 n / ) and O ( d 2 ),Purpose,msa_2410099853
Computer security problems often occur when there are disconnects between users understanding of their role in computer security and what is expected of them,Background,msa_2411354024
"To help users make good security decisions more easily , we need insights into the challenges they face in their daily computer usage",Purpose,msa_2411354024
We built and deployed the Security Behavior Observatory ( SBO ),Mechanism,msa_2411354024
to collect data on user behavior and machine configurations,Purpose,msa_2411354024
from participants home computers,Mechanism,msa_2411354024
"Combining SBO data with user interviews , this paper presents a qualitative study comparing users attitudes , behaviors , and understanding of computer security to the actual states of their computers",Method,msa_2411354024
Qualitative inductive thematic analysis of the interviews,Method,msa_2411354024
"produced engagement as the overarching theme , whereby participants with greater engagement in computer security and maintenance did not necessarily have more secure computer states",Findings,msa_2411354024
"Thus , user engagement alone may not be predictive of computer security",Findings,msa_2411354024
We identify several other themes,Findings,msa_2411354024

"The environment of a living cell is vastly different from that of an in vitro reaction system , an issue that presents great challenges to the use of in vitro models , or computer simulations based on them , for understanding biochemistry in vivo",Background,msa_2411751434
"Virus capsids make an excellent model system for such questions because they typically have few distinct components , making them amenable to in vitro and modeling studies , yet their assembly can involve complex networks of possible reactions that can not be resolved in detail by any current experimental technology",Background,msa_2411751434
"We previously fit kinetic simulation parameters to bulk in vitro assembly data to yield a close match between simulated and real data , and then used the simulations to study features of assembly that can not be monitored experimentally",Background,msa_2411751434
"The present work seeks to project how assembly in these simulations fit to in vitro data would be altered by computationally adding features of the cellular environment to the system , specifically the presence of nucleic acid about which many capsids assemble",Purpose,msa_2411751434
The major challenge of such work is computational : simulating fine-scale assembly pathways on the scale and in the parameter domains of real viruses is far too computationally costly to allow for explicit models of nucleic acid interaction,Purpose,msa_2411751434
"We bypass that limitation by applying analytical models of nucleic acid effects to adjust kinetic rate parameters learned from in vitro data to see how these adjustments , singly or in combination , might affect fine-scale assembly progress",Mechanism,msa_2411751434

We argue that biased games capture important aspects of the interaction between software agents,Mechanism,msa_2411961492
Our main result is that biased games satisfying certain mild conditions always admit an equilibrium,Findings,msa_2411961492
A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors,Background,msa_2413930874
Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard,Background,msa_2413930874
"Traditionally , exchanges took place in cycles , with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney",Background,msa_2413930874
"The recent introduction of chains , where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return , increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges -- -while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice",Background,msa_2413930874
"While chains can be quite long , unbounded-length chains are not desirable : planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons , and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail , so parallel shorter chains are better in practice",Purpose,msa_2413930874
"In this paper , we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded",Mechanism,msa_2413930874
This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges,Mechanism,msa_2413930874
"We introduce three new integer programming formulations , two of which are compact",Mechanism,msa_2413930874
"Furthermore , one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation ( which was not compact ) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient",Mechanism,msa_2413930874
"On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom , as well as on generated realistic large-scale data ,",Method,msa_2413930874
we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers -- -in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude,Findings,msa_2413930874
"Finally , we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account , under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure",Background,msa_2413930874
Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges,Background,msa_2413930874
Kidney exchange is a barter market where patients trade willing but medically incompatible donors,Background,msa_2414250851
"These trades occur via cycles , where each patient-donor pair both gives and receives a kidney , and via chains , which begin with an altruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return",Background,msa_2414250851
"For logistical reasons , the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a small constant , while chains can be much longer",Background,msa_2414250851
"Given a compatibility graph of patient-donor pairs , altruists , and feasible potential transplants between them , finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles and chains is NP-hard",Background,msa_2414250851
There has been much work on developing provably optimal solvers that are efficient in practice,Background,msa_2414250851
"One of the leading techniques has been branch and price , where column generation is used to incrementally bring cycles and chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis",Background,msa_2414250851
"In particular , only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model",Mechanism,msa_2414250851
We prove that finding a positive-price chain is NP-complete,Purpose,msa_2414250851
An increasingly prevalent technique for improving response time in queueing systems is the use of redundancy,Background,msa_2414584249
"In a system with redundant requests , each job that arrives to the system is copied and dispatched to multiple servers",Background,msa_2414584249
"As soon as the first copy completes service , the job is considered complete , and all remaining copies are deleted",Background,msa_2414584249
A great deal of empirical work has demonstrated that redundancy can significantly reduce response time in systems ranging from Google 's BigTable service to kidney transplant waitlists,Purpose,msa_2414584249
"We propose a theoretical model of redundancy , the Redundancy-d system , in which each job sends redundant copies to d servers chosen uniformly at random",Mechanism,msa_2414584249
We derive the first exact expressions for mean response time in Redundancy-d systems with any finite number of servers,Mechanism,msa_2414584249
"Complex networks have been shown to exhibit universal properties , with one of the most consistent patterns being the scale-free degree distribution ,",Background,msa_2414782537
but are there regularities obeyed by the r-hop neighborhood in real networks ? We answer this question,Purpose,msa_2414782537
by identifying another power-law pattern that describes the relationship between the fractions of node pairs C ( r ) within r hops and the hop count r,Mechanism,msa_2414782537
"This scale-free distribution is pervasive and describes a large variety of networks , ranging from social and urban to technological and biological networks",Mechanism,msa_2414782537
"In particular , inspired by the definition of the fractal correlation dimension D2 on a point-set , we consider the hop-count r to be the underlying distance metric between two vertices of the network , and we examine the scaling of C ( r ) with r",Mechanism,msa_2414782537
"We find that this relationship follows a power-law in real networks within the range 2 r d , where d is the effective diameter of the network , that is , the 90-th percentile distance",Mechanism,msa_2414782537
We term this relationship as power-hop and the corresponding power-law exponent as power-hop exponent h,Mechanism,msa_2414782537
"We provide theoretical justification for this pattern under successful existing network models , while we analyze a large set of real and synthetic network datasets",Method,msa_2414782537
"Modernsmartphoneplatformshavemillionsofapps , manyofwhich request permissions to access private data and resources , like user accounts or location",Background,msa_2415016544
"While these smartphone platforms provide varying degrees of control over these permissions , the sheer number of decisions that users are expected to manage has been shown to be unrealistically high",Purpose,msa_2415016544
"Prior research has shown that users are often unaware of , if not uncomfortable with , many of their permission settings",Background,msa_2415016544
Prior work also suggests that it is theoretically possible to predict many of the privacy settings a user would want by asking the user a small number of questions,Background,msa_2415016544
"However , this approach has neither been operationalized nor evaluated with actual users before",Purpose,msa_2415016544

We find that 78,Findings,msa_2415016544
7 % of the recommendations made by the PPA were adopted by users,Findings,msa_2415016544
"Following initial recommendations on permission settings , participants were motivated to further review and modify their settings with daily privacy nudges",Findings,msa_2415016544

"This work addresses the main challenges in real-world application of guided-waves for damage detection of pipelines , namely their complex nature and sensitivity to environmental and operational conditions ( EOCs )",Purpose,msa_2416363813
"Different propagation characteristics of the wave modes , their distinctive sensitivities to different types and ranges of EOCs , and to different damage scenarios , make the interpretation of diffuse-field guided-wave signals a challenging task",Background,msa_2416363813
This paper proposes an unsupervised feature-extraction method for online damage detection of pipelines under varying EOCs,Mechanism,msa_2416363813
The objective is to simplify diffuse-field guided-wave signals to a sparse subset of the arrivals that contains the majority of the energy carried by the signal,Purpose,msa_2416363813
We show that such a subset is less affected by EOCs compared to the complete time-traces of the signals,Findings,msa_2416363813
"Moreover , it is shown that the effects of damage on the energy of this subset suppress those of EOCs",Findings,msa_2416363813
A set of signals from the undamaged state of a pipe are used as reference records,Mechanism,msa_2416363813
The reference dataset is used to extract the aforementioned sparse representation,Mechanism,msa_2416363813
"During the monitoring stage , the sparse subset , representing the undamaged pipe , will not accurately reconstruct the energy of a signal from a damaged pipe",Mechanism,msa_2416363813
"In other words , such a sparse representation of guided-waves is sensitive to occurrence of damage",Mechanism,msa_2416363813
"Therefore , the energy estimation errors are used as damage-sensitive features for damage detection purposes",Mechanism,msa_2416363813
"While Bayesian methods are praised for their ability to incorporate useful prior knowledge , in practice , priors that allow for computationally convenient or tractable inference are more commonly used",Background,msa_2416873004
"In this paper , we investigate the following question : for a given model , is it possible to use any convenient prior to infer a false posterior , and afterwards , given some true prior of interest , quickly transform this result into the true posterior ?",Purpose,msa_2416873004
We present a procedure,Mechanism,msa_2416873004
to carry out this task,Purpose,msa_2416873004
": given an inferred false posterior and true prior , our algorithm generates samples from the true posterior",Mechanism,msa_2416873004
"This transformation procedure , which we call `` prior swapping '' works for arbitrary priors",Mechanism,msa_2416873004
"Notably , its cost is independent of data size",Mechanism,msa_2416873004
"It therefore allows us , in some cases , to apply significantly less-costly inference procedures to more-sophisticated models than previously possible",Mechanism,msa_2416873004
"It also lets us quickly perform any additional inferences , such as with updated priors or for many different hyperparameter settings , without touching the data",Mechanism,msa_2416873004

An age-old problem in the design of server farms is the choice of the task assignment policy,Background,msa_2418964453
This is the algorithm that determines how to assign incoming jobs to servers,Background,msa_2418964453
"Popular policies include Round-Robin assignment , Join-the-Shortest-Queue , Join-Queue-with-Least-Work , and so on",Background,msa_2418964453
"While much research has studied assignment policies , little has taken into account server-side variability -- the fact that the server we choose might be temporarily and unpredictably slow",Purpose,msa_2418964453

How can we optimize the underlying graph structure to affect the outcome of such dissemination processes in a desired way ( e,Background,msa_2431497588
", stop a virus propagation , facilitate the propagation of a piece of good idea , etc ) ? Existing research suggests that the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph is the key metric in determining the so-called epidemic threshold for a variety of dissemination models",Background,msa_2431497588

to robustly solve the problems mentioned above,Purpose,msa_2432917172
"Similar to the region-based CNNs , our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the region-of-interest ( RoI ) detection component",Mechanism,msa_2432917172
"However , far apart of that network , there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection",Mechanism,msa_2432917172

taking a game-theoretic viewpoint,Mechanism,msa_2435502378
"In our setting , samples are supplied by strategic agents , who wish to pull the estimate as close as possible to their own value",Mechanism,msa_2435502378
"In this setting , the sample mean gives rise to manipulation opportunities , whereas the sample median does not",Mechanism,msa_2435502378
Our key question is whether the sample median is the best ( in terms of mean squared error ) truthful estimator of the population mean,Purpose,msa_2435502378
"We show that when the underlying distribution is symmetric , there are truthful estimators that dominate the median",Mechanism,msa_2435502378
This paper develops an approach,Mechanism,msa_2439655505
"for efficiently solving general convex optimization problems specified as disciplined convex programs ( DCP ) ,",Purpose,msa_2439655505

"Specifically we develop an algorithm based upon fast epigraph projections , projections onto the epigraph of a convex function , an approach closely linked to proximal operator methods",Mechanism,msa_2439655505
"We show that by using these operators , we can solve any disciplined convex program without transforming the problem to a standard cone form , as is done by current DCP libraries",Mechanism,msa_2439655505
"We then develop a large library of efficient epigraph projection operators , mirroring and extending work on fast proximal algorithms , for many common convex functions",Mechanism,msa_2439655505
"Finally , we evaluate the performance of the algorithm",Method,msa_2439655505
Malware authors have been using websites to distribute their products as a way to evade spam filters and classic anti-virus engines,Background,msa_2441073633
"Yet there has been relatively little work in modeling the behaviors and temporal properties of websites , as most research focuses on detecting whether a website distributes malware",Purpose,msa_2441073633
In this paper we ask : How does web-based malware spread ?,Purpose,msa_2441073633
We conduct an extensive study and follow a website-centric and user-centric point of view,Method,msa_2441073633
"We collect data from four online databases , including Symantec 's WINE Project , for a total of more than 600K malicious URLs and over 500K users",Method,msa_2441073633

"Second , we find that malicious URLs can be surprisingly long-lived , with 10 % of malicious sites staying active for three months or more",Findings,msa_2441073633
"Third , we observe that a significant number of URLs exhibit the same temporal pattern that suggests a flush-crowd behavior , inflicting most of their damage during the first few days of appearance",Findings,msa_2441073633

"The design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions , i",Background,msa_2441441494
e,Background,msa_2441441494
"multi item auctions over bundles of goods , is one of the most fundamental problems in computational economics , unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale",Background,msa_2441441494
"In the traditional economic models , it is assumed that the bidders ' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has perfect knowledge of this distribution",Background,msa_2441441494
"Despite this strong and oftentimes unrealistic assumption , it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing combinatorial auction remains unknown",Background,msa_2441441494
"In recent years , automated mechanism design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions",Purpose,msa_2441441494
The most scalable automated mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders ' valuation distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction class,Background,msa_2441441494

We leverage the expressiveness of latent probabilistic models ( e,Mechanism,msa_244358618

", Dirichlet processes ) , and give online and distributed inference algorithms that scale to terabyte datasets and adapt the inferred representation with the arrival of new documents",Mechanism,msa_244358618
Motivation :,Purpose,msa_2444102376
It remains a challenge to detect associations between genotypes and phenotypes because of insufficient sample sizes and complex underlying mechanisms involved in associations,Background,msa_2444102376
"Fortunately , it is becoming more feasible to obtain gene expression data in addition to genotypes and phenotypes , giving us new opportunities to detect true genotypephenotype associations while unveiling their association mechanisms",Purpose,msa_2444102376
Results :,Findings,msa_2444102376
"In this article , we propose a novel method , NETAM ,",Mechanism,msa_2444102376
"that accurately detects associations between SNPs and phenotypes , as well as gene traits involved in such associations",Purpose,msa_2444102376
"We take a network-driven approach : NETAM first constructs an association network , where nodes represent SNPs , gene traits or phenotypes , and edges represent the strength of association between two nodes",Mechanism,msa_2444102376
"NETAM assigns a score to each path from an SNP to a phenotype , and then identifies significant paths based on the scores",Mechanism,msa_2444102376
"In our simulation study ,",Method,msa_2444102376
"we show that NETAM finds significantly more phenotype-associated SNPs than traditional genotypephenotype association analysis under false positive control , taking advantage of gene expression data",Findings,msa_2444102376
"Furthermore , we applied NETAM on late-onset Alzheimers disease data",Method,msa_2444102376
"and identified 477 significant path associations , among which we analyzed paths related to beta-amyloid , estrogen , and nicotine pathways",Findings,msa_2444102376
We also provide hypothetical biological pathways to explain our findings,Method,msa_2444102376
"We introduce the Multiple Quantile Graphical Model ( MQGM ) , which extends the neighborhood selection approach of Meinshausen and Buhlmann",Mechanism,msa_2460864273
for learning sparse graphical models,Purpose,msa_2460864273
The latter is defined by the basic subproblem of modeling the conditional mean of one variable as a sparse function of all others,Mechanism,msa_2460864273
"Our approach models a set of conditional quantiles of one variable as a sparse function of all others , and hence offers a much richer , more expressive class of conditional distribution estimates",Mechanism,msa_2460864273
"We establish that , under suitable regularity conditions , the MQGM identifies the exact conditional independencies with probability tending to one as the problem size grows , even outside of the usual homoskedastic Gaussian data model",Mechanism,msa_2460864273
We develop an efficient algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2460864273
for fitting the MQGM,Purpose,msa_2460864273
using the alternating direction method of multipliers,Mechanism,msa_2460864273
We also describe a strategy,Mechanism,msa_2460864273
for sampling from the joint distribution that underlies the MQGM estimate,Purpose,msa_2460864273
"Lastly , we present detailed experiments",Method,msa_2460864273
"'Alice ' is submitting one web search per five minutes , for three hours in a row - is it normal ? How to detect abnormal search behaviors , among Alice and other users ? Is there any distinct pattern in Alice 's ( or other users ' ) search behavior ?",Purpose,msa_2460919741
"We studied what is probably the largest , publicly available , query log that contains more than 30 million queries from 0",Method,msa_2460919741

"In this paper , we present a novel , user-and group-level framework , M3A : Model , MetaModel and Anomaly detection",Mechanism,msa_2460919741
"For each user , we discover and explain a surprising , bi-modal pattern of the inter-arrival time ( IAT ) of landed queries ( queries with user click-through )",Findings,msa_2460919741
"Specifically , the model Camel-Log is proposed",Mechanism,msa_2460919741
to describe such an IAT distribution ;,Purpose,msa_2460919741
we then notice the correlations among its parameters at the group level,Findings,msa_2460919741
"Thus , we further propose the metamodel Meta-Click ,",Mechanism,msa_2460919741

"The large number of user-generated videos uploaded on to the Internet everyday has led to many commercial video search engines , which mainly rely on text metadata for search",Background,msa_2462333696
"However , metadata is often lacking for user-generated videos , thus these videos are unsearchable by current search engines",Purpose,msa_2462333696
"Therefore , content-based video retrieval ( CBVR ) tackles this metadata-scarcity problem by directly analyzing the visual and audio streams of each video",Purpose,msa_2462333696
"CBVR encompasses multiple research topics , including low-level feature design , feature fusion , semantic detector training and video search/reranking",Purpose,msa_2462333696
We present novel strategies in these topics,Mechanism,msa_2462333696
to enhance CBVR in both accuracy,Purpose,msa_2462333696
and,Mechanism,msa_2462333696
speed,Purpose,msa_2462333696
"under different query inputs , including pure textual queries and query by video examples",Mechanism,msa_2462333696
"Our proposed strategies have been incorporated into our submission for the TRECVID 2014 Multimedia Event Detection evaluation ,",Method,msa_2462333696
Recent computer systems research has proposed using redundant requests to reduce latency,Background,msa_2462681966
The idea is to run a request on multiple servers and wait for the first completion ( discarding all remaining copies of the request ),Background,msa_2462681966
"However , there is no exact analysis of systems with redundancy",Purpose,msa_2462681966
This paper presents the first exact analysis of systems with redundancy,Mechanism,msa_2462681966
"We allow for any number of classes of redundant requests , any number of classes of non-redundant requests , any degree of redundancy , and any number of heterogeneous servers",Mechanism,msa_2462681966
In all cases we derive the limiting distribution of the state of the system,Mechanism,msa_2462681966
"In small ( two or three server ) systems , we derive simple forms for the distribution of response time of both the redundant classes and non-redundant classes , and we quantify the `` gain '' to redundant classes and `` pain '' to non-redundant classes caused by redundancy",Mechanism,msa_2462681966
We find some surprising results,Findings,msa_2462681966
"First , the response time of a fully redundant class follows a simple exponential distribution and that of the non-redundant class follows a generalized hyperexponential",Findings,msa_2462681966
"Second , fully redundant classes are `` immune '' to any pain caused by other classes becoming redundant",Findings,msa_2462681966
"We also compare redundancy with other approaches for reducing latency , such as optimal probabilistic splitting of a class among servers ( Opt-Split ) and join-the-shortest-queue ( JSQ ) routing of a class",Method,msa_2462681966
Work in human-computer interaction has generally assumed either a single user or a group of users working together in a shared virtual space,Background,msa_2463771133
"Recent crowd-powered systems use a different model in which a dynamic group of individuals ( the crowd ) collectively form a single actor that responds to real-time performance tasks , e",Background,msa_2463771133
", controlling an on-screen character , driving a robot , or operating an existing desktop interface",Background,msa_2463771133
"In this paper , we introduce the idea of the crowd actor as a way",Mechanism,msa_2463771133
"to model coordination strategies and resulting collective performance , and discuss how the crowd actor is influenced not only by the domain on which it is asked to operate but also by the personality endowed to it by algorithms used to combine the inputs of constituent participants",Purpose,msa_2463771133
"Nowhere is the focus on the individual performer more finely resolved than in the study of the human psychomotor system , a mainstay topic in psychology that , largely owing to Fitts law , also has a legacy in HCI",Background,msa_2463771133
"Therefore , we explored our notion of a crowd actor",Purpose,msa_2463771133
by modeling the crowd as a individual motor system performing pointing tasks,Mechanism,msa_2463771133
"We combined the input of 200 participants in a controlled offline experiment to demonstrate the inherent trade-offs between speed and errors based on personality , the number of constituent individuals , and the mechanism used to distribute work across the group",Method,msa_2463771133
"Finally , 10 workers participated in a synchronous experiment to explore how the crowd actor responds in a real online setting",Method,msa_2463771133
We propose an identity-aware multi-object tracker based on the solution path algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2464100022
Our tracker not only produces,Mechanism,msa_2464100022
identity-coherent trajectories,Purpose,msa_2464100022
"based on cues such as face recognition , but also has the ability",Mechanism,msa_2464100022
to pinpoint potential tracking errors,Purpose,msa_2464100022
"The tracker is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem with l0 norm constraints , which we propose to solve with the solution path algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2464100022
"The algorithm successively solves the same optimization problem but under different lp norm constraints , where p gradually decreases from 1 to 0",Mechanism,msa_2464100022
"Inspired by the success of the solution path algorithm in various machine learning tasks , this strategy is expected to converge to a better local minimum than directly minimizing the hardly solvable l0 norm or the roughly approximated l1 norm constraints",Mechanism,msa_2464100022
"Furthermore , the acquired solution path complies with the `` decision making process '' of the tracker , which provides more insight to locating potential tracking errors",Mechanism,msa_2464100022
Experiments,Method,msa_2464100022
"In this work , we have undertaken the task of occlusion and low-resolution robust facial gender classification",Purpose,msa_2464655605
"Inspired by the trainable attention model via deep architecture , and the fact that the periocular region is proven to be the most salient region for gender classification purposes , we are able to design a progressive convolutional neural network training paradigm",Mechanism,msa_2464655605
to enforce the attention shift during the learning process,Purpose,msa_2464655605
The hope is to enable the network to attend to particular high-profile regions ( e,Purpose,msa_2464655605
g,Purpose,msa_2464655605
the periocular region ) without the need to change the network architecture itself,Purpose,msa_2464655605
The network benefits from this attention shift and becomes more robust towards occlusions and low-resolution degradations,Mechanism,msa_2464655605
"With the progressively trained CNN models , we have achieved better gender classification results on the large-scale PCSO mugshot database with 400K images under occlusion and low-resolution settings , compared to the one undergone traditional training",Findings,msa_2464655605

Advances in fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) make it feasible to detect multiple copy-number changes in hundreds of cells of solid tumors,Background,msa_2469326010
"Studies using FISH , sequencing , and other technologies have revealed substantial intra-tumor heterogeneity",Background,msa_2469326010
The evolution of subclones in tumors may be modeled by phylogenies,Background,msa_2469326010
Tumors often harbor aneuploid or polyploid cell populations,Background,msa_2469326010
Using a FISH probe to estimate changes in ploidy can guide the creation of trees that model changes in ploidy and individual gene copy-number variations,Purpose,msa_2469326010
We present FISHtrees 3,Mechanism,msa_2469326010
"0 , which implements a ploidy-based tree building method based on mixed integer linear programming ( MILP )",Mechanism,msa_2469326010
The ploidy-based modeling in FISHtrees includes a new formulation of the problem of merging trees for changes of a single gene into trees modeling changes in multiple genes and the ploidy,Mechanism,msa_2469326010
"When multiple samples are collected from each patient , varying over time or tumor regions , it is useful to evaluate similarities in tumor progression among the samples",Mechanism,msa_2469326010

"In learning latent variable models ( LVMs ) , it is important to effectively capture infrequent patterns and shrink model size without sacrificing modeling power",Background,msa_2469914293
"Various studies have been done to `` diversify '' a LVM , which aim to learn a diverse set of latent components in LVMs",Background,msa_2469914293
"Most existing studies fall into a frequentist-style regularization framework , where the components are learned via point estimation",Purpose,msa_2469914293
"In this paper , we investigate how to `` diversify '' LVMs in the paradigm of Bayesian learning , which has advantages complementary to point estimation , such as alleviating overfitting via model averaging and quantifying uncertainty",Purpose,msa_2469914293
We propose two approaches that have complementary advantages,Mechanism,msa_2469914293
One is to define diversity-promoting mutual angular priors which assign larger density to components with larger mutual angles based on Bayesian network and von Mises-Fisher distribution and use these priors to affect the posterior via Bayes rule,Mechanism,msa_2469914293
We develop two efficient approximate posterior inference algorithms based on variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling,Mechanism,msa_2469914293
The other approach is to impose diversity-promoting regularization directly over the post-data distribution of components,Mechanism,msa_2469914293
These two methods are applied to the Bayesian mixture of experts model to encourage the `` experts '' to be diverse,Method,msa_2469914293
We study the problem of automatically building hypernym taxonomies from textual and visual data,Purpose,msa_2469989264
"Previous works in taxonomy induction generally ignore the increasingly prominent visual data , which encode important perceptual semantics",Purpose,msa_2469989264
"Instead , we propose a probabilistic model",Mechanism,msa_2469989264
for taxonomy induction,Purpose,msa_2469989264
by jointly leveraging text and images,Mechanism,msa_2469989264
"To avoid hand-crafted feature engineering , we design end-to-end features based on distributed representations of images and words",Mechanism,msa_2469989264
The model is discriminatively trained given a small set of existing ontologies and is capable of building full taxonomies from scratch for a collection of unseen conceptual label items with associated images,Mechanism,msa_2469989264

"Besides appearance information , the video contains temporal evolution , which represents an important and useful source of information about its content",Background,msa_2471378045
Many video representation approaches are based on the motion information within the video,Background,msa_2471378045
The common approach to extract the motion information is to compute the optical flow from the vertical and the horizontal temporal evolution of two consecutive frames,Background,msa_2471378045
"However , the computation of optical flow is very demanding in terms of computational cost , in many cases being the most significant processing step within the overall pipeline of the target video analysis application",Purpose,msa_2471378045
In this work we propose a very efficient approach,Mechanism,msa_2471378045
to capture the motion information within the video,Purpose,msa_2471378045
"Our method is based on a simple temporal and spatial derivation , which captures the changes between two consecutive frames",Mechanism,msa_2471378045
"The proposed descriptor , Histograms of Motion Gradients ( HMG ) , is validated on the UCF50 human action recognition dataset",Method,msa_2471378045
The applications of laser scanning technology are rapidly expanding in the civil engineering domain,Background,msa_2471837237
LiDAR technology is now commonly used in the surveying and monitoring of large infrastructures,Background,msa_2471837237
"In particular , tunnels have become key transport infrastructures , subjected to maintenance processes that allow quality checks for tunnel modifications or tunnel clearance and profile checks",Background,msa_2471837237
The research described in this paper targets developing an approach,Mechanism,msa_2471837237
to semi-automatically retrieve the tunnel vertical clearance,Purpose,msa_2471837237
based on ground based mobile LiDAR data,Mechanism,msa_2471837237
"The steps of this approach include extraction of cross sections orthogonal to the vehicle trajectory and road markings based on radiometric information , and conversion of cross section to a two-dimensional profile to estimate the vertical clearance",Mechanism,msa_2471837237
"The validation of the developed approach is done using real-life case study , a road tunnel in southern Galicia , Spain",Method,msa_2471837237
An accuracy of 100 % in detection of cross sections is achieved,Findings,msa_2471837237
Only one of the cross sections shows a relative error in vertical clearance measurement higher than 1 %,Findings,msa_2471837237
The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed approach for computing vertical clearances and,Findings,msa_2471837237
Complex event detection on unconstrained Internet videos has seen much progress in recent years,Background,msa_2472345018
"However , state-of-the-art performance degrades dramatically when the number of positive training exemplars falls short",Purpose,msa_2472345018
"Since label acquisition is costly , laborious , and time-consuming , there is a real need to consider the much more challenging semantic event search problem , where no example video is given",Purpose,msa_2472345018
"In this paper , we present a state-of-the-art event search system without any example videos",Mechanism,msa_2472345018
Relying on the key observation that events ( e,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
g,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
dog show ) are usually compositions of multiple mid-level concepts ( e,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
g,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
"`` dog , '' `` theater , '' and `` dog jumping '' ) , we first train a skip-gram model to measure the relevance of each concept with the event of interest",Mechanism,msa_2472345018
"The relevant concept classifiers then cast votes on the test videos but their reliability , due to lack of labeled training videos , has been largely unaddressed",Mechanism,msa_2472345018
We propose to combine the concept classifiers based on a principled estimate of their accuracy on the unlabeled test videos,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
A novel warping technique is proposed to improve the performance and an efficient highly-scalable algorithm is provided to quickly solve the resulting optimization,Mechanism,msa_2472345018
"We conduct extensive experiments on the latest TRECVID MEDTest 2014 , MEDTest 2013 and CCV datasets ,",Method,msa_2472345018
"Kidney exchange , where candidates with organ failure trade incompatible but willing donors , is a lifesaving alternative to the deceased donor waitlist , which has inadequate supply to meet demand",Background,msa_2472691239
"While fielded kidney exchanges see huge benefit from altruistic kidney donors ( who give an organ without a paired needy candidate ) , a significantly higher medical risk to the donor deters similar altruism with livers",Background,msa_2472691239
"In this paper , we begin by proposing the idea of liver exchange , and show on demographically accurate data that",Mechanism,msa_2472691239
vetted kidney exchange algorithms can be adapted to clear such an exchange at the nationwide level,Purpose,msa_2472691239
We then explore crossorgan donation where kidneys and livers can be bartered for each other,Mechanism,msa_2472691239
We show theoretically that this multiorgan exchange provides linearly more transplants than running separate kidney and liver exchanges ; this linear gain is a product of altruistic kidney donors creating chains that thread through the liver pool,Mechanism,msa_2472691239
We support this result experimentally on demographically accurate multi-organ exchanges,Method,msa_2472691239
"Given a directed graph of millions of nodes , how can we automatically spot anomalous , suspicious nodes judging only from their connectivity patterns ?",Purpose,msa_2473813716
"Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications , from Twitter users who buy fake followers , manipulating the social network , to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks , disturbing the network traffic graph",Background,msa_2473813716
"We propose a fast and effective method , C atch S ync , which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters : ( a ) synchronized behavior : suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior patterns because they are often required to perform some task together ( such as follow the same user ) ; and ( b ) rare behavior : their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority",Mechanism,msa_2473813716
We introduce novel measures,Mechanism,msa_2473813716
to quantify both concepts ( synchronicity and normality ),Purpose,msa_2473813716
and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots,Mechanism,msa_2473813716
"Thanks to careful design , C atch S ync has the following desirable properties : ( a ) it is scalable to large datasets , being linear in the graph size ; ( b ) it is parameter free ; and ( c ) it is side-information-oblivious : it can operate using only the topology , without needing labeled data , nor timing information , and the like",Mechanism,msa_2473813716
", while still capable of using side information if available",Mechanism,msa_2473813716
"We applied C atch S ync on three large , real datasets , 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph , 3-billion-edge , and 12-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graphs , and several synthetic ones ;",Method,msa_2473813716
Action recognition ( AR ) is one of the most important tasks in video analysis and computer vision,Background,msa_2473890477
Recently a large number of related methods have been proposed,Background,msa_2473890477
"While most of these methods are investigated on AR datasets collected from the visible spectrum , the AR problem under infrared scenarios still has not attracted much attention",Purpose,msa_2473890477
There is even few public infrared datasets available for supporting the fundamental evaluation requirements of this research,Purpose,msa_2473890477
"To this issue , this work aims to emphasize the importance of the infrared AR problem in applications and arouse researchers ' attention on this task",Purpose,msa_2473890477
"Specifically , we construct a new Infrared Action Recognition ( InfAR ) dataset captured at different times , including in summer and winter , and explore how discriminable actions in our InfAR dataset are with the state-of-the-art pipelines based on low-level features and deep convolutional neural network ( CNN ) , respectively",Mechanism,msa_2473890477
"Our results reveal : ( 1 ) In all , dense trajectory feature can achieve the best performance while the appearance features , e",Findings,msa_2473890477
", HOG , have relatively poorer performance ; ( 2 ) the encoding method of vector of locally aggregated descriptors is evidently better than that of the widely-used Fisher Vector ; ( 3 ) the late fusion facilitates a better performance than early fusion ; ( 4 ) action videos captured in winter is more discriminable than in summer ; ( 5 ) compared to appearance information , the motion information is more essential for infrared action recognition and utilizing this information through deep CNN can improve greatly the performance",Findings,msa_2473890477
The best performance achieved on our dataset is 76,Findings,msa_2473890477

Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects so that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters,Background,msa_2475245514
"The crucial step in most clustering algorithms is to find an appropriate similarity metric , which is both challenging and problem-dependent",Background,msa_2475245514
"Supervised clustering approaches , which can exploit labeled clustered training data that share a common metric with the test set , have thus been proposed",Purpose,msa_2475245514
"Unfortunately , current metric learning approaches for supervised clustering do not scale to large or even medium-sized datasets",Purpose,msa_2475245514
"In this paper , we propose a new structured Mahalanobis Distance Metric Learning method",Mechanism,msa_2475245514
for supervised clustering,Purpose,msa_2475245514
We formulate our problem as an instance of large margin structured prediction and prove that it can be solved very efficiently in closed-form,Mechanism,msa_2475245514
The complexity of our method is ( in most cases ) linear in the size of the training dataset,Mechanism,msa_2475245514
We further reveal a striking similarity between our approach and multivariate linear regression,Mechanism,msa_2475245514

"Matrix sketching is aimed at finding close approximations of a matrix by factors of much smaller dimensions , which has important applications in optimization and machine learning",Background,msa_2479701863
"Given a matrix A of size m by n , state-of-the-art randomized algorithms take O ( m * n ) time and space to obtain its low-rank decomposition",Background,msa_2479701863
"Although quite useful , the need to store or manipulate the entire matrix makes it a computational bottleneck for truly large and dense inputs",Purpose,msa_2479701863
"Can we sketch an m-by-n matrix in O ( m + n ) cost by accessing only a small fraction of its rows and columns , without knowing anything about the remaining data ?",Purpose,msa_2479701863
"In this paper , we propose the cascaded bilateral sampling ( CABS ) framework",Mechanism,msa_2479701863
to solve this problem,Purpose,msa_2479701863
We start from demonstrating how the approximation quality of bilateral matrix sketching depends on the encoding powers of sampling,Mechanism,msa_2479701863
"In particular , the sampled rows and columns should correspond to the code-vectors in the ground truth decompositions",Mechanism,msa_2479701863
"Motivated by this analysis , we propose to first generate a pilot-sketch using simple random sampling , and then pursue more advanced , `` follow-up '' sampling on the pilot-sketch factors seeking maximal encoding powers",Mechanism,msa_2479701863
"In this cascading process , the rise of approximation quality is shown to be lower-bounded by the improvement of encoding powers in the follow-up sampling step , thus theoretically guarantees the algorithmic boosting property",Mechanism,msa_2479701863
"Computationally , our framework only takes linear time and space , and at the same time its performance rivals the quality of state-of-the-art algorithms consuming a quadratic amount of resources",Mechanism,msa_2479701863
Empirical evaluations on benchmark data,Method,msa_2479701863
This paper studies attackers with control objectives against cyber-physical systems ( CPS ),Purpose,msa_2482202112
"The system is equipped with its own controller and attack detector , and the goal of the attacker is to move the system to a target state while altering the system 's actuator input and sensor output to avoid detection",Mechanism,msa_2482202112
"We formulate a cost function that reflects the attacker 's goals , and , using dynamic programming , we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a linear feedback of the attacker 's state estimate",Mechanism,msa_2482202112
"By changing the parameters of the cost function , we show how an attacker can design optimal attacks to balance the control objective and the detection avoidance objective",Mechanism,msa_2482202112
At least 10 % of the global population has dyslexia,Background,msa_2483149093
"In the United States and Spain , dyslexia is associated with a large percentage of school drop out",Background,msa_2483149093
"Current methods to detect risk of dyslexia are language specific , expensive , or do not scale well because they require a professional or extensive equipment",Purpose,msa_2483149093
A central challenge to detecting dyslexia is handling its differing manifestations across languages,Purpose,msa_2483149093
"To address this ,",Purpose,msa_2483149093
"we designed a browser-based game , Dytective , to detect risk of dyslexia across the English and Spanish languages",Mechanism,msa_2483149093
Dytective consists of linguistic tasks informed by analysis of common errors made by persons with dyslexia,Mechanism,msa_2483149093
"To evaluate Dytective , we conducted a user study with 60 English and Spanish speaking children between 7 and 12 years old",Method,msa_2483149093
We found children with and without dyslexia differed significantly in their performance on the game,Findings,msa_2483149093

"Acute hypotensive episodes ( AHEs ) are serious clinical events in intensive care units ( ICUs ) , and require immediate treatment to prevent patient injury",Background,msa_2485305550
Reducing the risks associated with an AHE requires effective and efficient mining of data generated from multiple physiological time series,Purpose,msa_2485305550
"We propose HeartCast , a model that extracts essential features from such data",Mechanism,msa_2485305550
to effectively predict AHE,Purpose,msa_2485305550
"HeartCast combines a non-linear support vector machine with best-feature extraction via analysis of the baseline threshold , quartile parameters , and window size of the physiological signals",Mechanism,msa_2485305550
Our approach has the following benefits : ( a ) it extracts the most relevant features ; ( b ) it provides the best results for identification of an AHE event ; ( c ) it is fast and scales with linear complexity over the length of the window ; and ( d ) it can manage missing values and noise/outliers by using a best-feature extraction method,Mechanism,msa_2485305550
We performed experiments on data continuously captured from physiological time series of ICU patients ( roughly 3 GB of processed data ),Method,msa_2485305550
Summary An important experimental design question for high-throughput time series studies is the number of replicates required for accurate reconstruction of the profiles,Background,msa_2485612477
"Due to budget and sample availability constraints , more replicates imply fewer time points and vice versa",Background,msa_2485612477
We analyze the performance of dense and replicate sampling,Purpose,msa_2485612477
by developing a theoretical framework that focuses on a restricted yet expressive set of possible curves over a wide range of noise levels and by analyzing real expression data,Mechanism,msa_2485612477
"For both the theoretical analysis and experimental data ,",Method,msa_2485612477
"we observe that , under reasonable noise levels , autocorrelations in the time series data allow dense sampling to better determine the correct levels of non-sampled points when compared to replicate sampling",Findings,msa_2485612477
A Java implementation of our framework can be used,Mechanism,msa_2485612477
to determine the best replicate strategy given the expected noise,Purpose,msa_2485612477
"In this paper , we present an advanced deep learning based approach",Mechanism,msa_2486323017
to automatically determine whether a driver is using a cell-phone as well as detect if his/her hands are on the steering wheel ( i,Purpose,msa_2486323017
e,Purpose,msa_2486323017
counting the number of hands on the wheel ),Purpose,msa_2486323017
"To robustly detect small objects such as hands ,",Purpose,msa_2486323017
"we propose Multiple Scale Faster-RCNN ( MSFRCNN ) approach that uses a standard Region Proposal Network ( RPN ) generation and incorporates feature maps from shallower convolution feature maps , i",Mechanism,msa_2486323017
e,Mechanism,msa_2486323017
"conv3 and conv4 , for ROI pooling",Mechanism,msa_2486323017
"In our driver distraction detection framework , we first make use of the proposed MS-FRCNN to detect individual objects , namely , a hand , a cell-phone , and a steering wheel",Mechanism,msa_2486323017
"Then , the geometric information is extracted to determine if a cell-phone is being used or how many hands are on the wheel",Mechanism,msa_2486323017
The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated on the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications ( VIVA ) Challenge database and the challenging Strategic Highway Research Program ( SHRP-2 ) face view videos that was acquired to monitor drivers under naturalistic driving conditions,Method,msa_2486323017
The experimental,Method,msa_2486323017
results show that our method archives better performance than Faster R-CNN on both hands on wheel detection and cell-phone usage detection while remaining at similar testing cost,Findings,msa_2486323017
"Compare to the state-of-the-art cell-phone usage detection ,",Method,msa_2486323017
"What is a fair way to assign rooms to several housemates , and divide the rent between them ? This is not just a theoretical question : many people have used the Spliddit website to obtain envy-free solutions to rent division instances",Background,msa_2486394447
"But envy freeness , in and of itself , is insufficient to guarantee outcomes that people view as intuitive and acceptable",Background,msa_2486394447
"We therefore focus on solutions that optimize a criterion of social justice , subject to the envy freeness constraint , in order to pinpoint the `` fairest '' solutions",Purpose,msa_2486394447
We develop a general algorithmic framework,Mechanism,msa_2486394447
that enables the computation of such solutions in polynomial time,Purpose,msa_2486394447
"We then study the relations between natural optimization objectives ,",Method,msa_2486394447
"and identify the maximin solution , which maximizes the minimum utility subject to envy freeness , as the most attractive",Findings,msa_2486394447
"We demonstrate , in theory and using experiments on real data from Spliddit ,",Method,msa_2486394447
that the maximin solution gives rise to significant gains in terms of our optimization objectives,Findings,msa_2486394447
"Finally , a user study with Spliddit users as subjects",Method,msa_2486394447
demonstrates that people find the maximin solution to be significantly fairer than arbitrary envy-free solutions ; this user study is unprecedented in that it asks people about their real-world rent division instances,Findings,msa_2486394447
Weakly supervised methods have recently become one of the most popular machine learning methods since they are able to be used on large-scale datasets without the critical requirement of richly annotated data,Background,msa_2490266937
"In this paper , we present a novel , self-taught , discriminative",Mechanism,msa_2490266937
facial feature analysis,Purpose,msa_2490266937
approach in the weakly supervised framework,Mechanism,msa_2490266937
Our method can find regions which are discriminative across classes yet consistent within a class and can solve many face related problems,Mechanism,msa_2490266937
The proposed method first trains a deep face model with high discriminative capability to extract facial features,Mechanism,msa_2490266937
The hypercolumn features are then used to give pixel level representation for better classification performance along with discriminative region detection,Mechanism,msa_2490266937
"In addition , calibration approaches are proposed to enable the system to deal with multi-class and mixed-class problems",Mechanism,msa_2490266937
The system is also able to detect multiple discriminative regions from one image,Mechanism,msa_2490266937
We study a component-based approach to simplify the challenges of verifying large-scale hybrid systems,Purpose,msa_2493608191
Component-based modeling can be used to split large models into partial models to reduce modeling complexity,Background,msa_2493608191
"Yet , verification results also need to transfer from components to composites",Purpose,msa_2493608191
"In this paper , we propose a component-based hybrid system verification approach that combines the advantages of component-based modeling e",Mechanism,msa_2493608191
", reduced model complexity with the advantages of formal verification e",Mechanism,msa_2493608191
", guaranteed contract compliance",Mechanism,msa_2493608191
"Our strategy is to decompose the system into components , verify their local safety individually and compose them to form an overall system that provably satisfies a global contract , without proving the whole system",Mechanism,msa_2493608191
We introduce the necessary formalism,Mechanism,msa_2493608191
to define the structure and behavior of components,Purpose,msa_2493608191
and a technique,Mechanism,msa_2493608191
how to compose components,Purpose,msa_2493608191
Learning video concept detectors automatically from the big but noisy web data with no additional manual annotations is a novel but challenging area in the multimedia and the machine learning community,Background,msa_2495270859
"A considerable amount of videos on the web are associated with rich but noisy contextual information , such as the title , which provides weak annotations or labels about the video content",Purpose,msa_2495270859
"To leverage the big noisy web labels ,",Purpose,msa_2495270859
"this paper proposes a novel method called WEbly-Labeled Learning ( WELL ) , which is established on the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm inspired by the learning process of human",Mechanism,msa_2495270859
WELL introduces a number of novel multi-modal approaches to incorporate meaningful prior knowledge called curriculum from the noisy web videos,Mechanism,msa_2495270859
"To investigate this problem , we empirically study the curriculum constructed from the multi-modal features of the videos collected from YouTube and Flickr",Method,msa_2495270859
The efficacy and the scalability of WELL have been extensively demonstrated,Findings,msa_2495270859
"on two public benchmarks , including the largest multimedia dataset and the largest manually-labeled video set",Method,msa_2495270859

Brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs ) have the potential to restore motor abilities to paralyzed individuals,Background,msa_2496221697
"These systems act by reading motor intent signals directly from the brain and using them to control , for example , the movement of a cursor on a computer screen or the motion of a robotic limb",Background,msa_2496221697
"To construct a BCI , a mapping must be specified that dictates how neural activity will actuate the device",Background,msa_2496221697
"How should these mappings be constructed to maximize user performance ? Most approaches have focused on this problem from an estimation standpoint , i",Purpose,msa_2496221697
", mappings are designed to implement the best estimate of motor intent possible , under various sets of assumptions about how the recorded neural signals represent motor intent",Purpose,msa_2496221697
Teaching chess to students with learning disabilities has been shown to benefit their school performance in unrelated domains,Background,msa_2501957138
"At the same time , chess involves skills that are highly correlated with dyslexia , such as visuospatial and calculation abilities",Background,msa_2501957138
"In this paper , we created a online chess game",Mechanism,msa_2501957138
designed for people with dyslexia and seek to understand whether people with dyslexia learn and play chess online in ways that differ from other students and whether such differences may be leveraged to improve classroom performance,Purpose,msa_2501957138
To test how people with dyslexia learn to play chess,Purpose,msa_2501957138
"we carried out a within-subject experiment with 62 participants , 31 of them with diagnosed dyslexia",Method,msa_2501957138
"Participants used an instrumented web-based chess learning platform that we developed to ( i ) complete lessons on how to play chess and about chess theory , ( ii ) work through exercises designed to test and reaffirm their skills , and ( iii ) play chess against a computer opponent",Method,msa_2501957138
We could not find significant differences on four dependent measures out of the twelve measures we collected,Findings,msa_2501957138

This paper studies attackers with specific objectives against a cyber physical system,Purpose,msa_2502650246
The attacker performs an integrity attack in order to move the system to a target state while evading detection over a finite time window,Background,msa_2502650246
We formulate and solve an optimal control problem,Mechanism,msa_2502650246
that captures the attacker 's objective - the solution gives the optimal sequence of attacks,Purpose,msa_2502650246
We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal attack sequence,Mechanism,msa_2502650246
"Finally , we demonstrate our proposed attack strategy",Findings,msa_2502650246
We study the problem of variable selection in convex nonparametric regression,Purpose,msa_2504832420
"Under the assumption that the true regression function is convex and sparse , we develop a screening procedure",Mechanism,msa_2504832420
to select a subset of variables that contains the relevant variables,Purpose,msa_2504832420
"Our approach is a two-stage quadratic programming method that estimates a sum of one-dimensional convex functions , followed by one-dimensional concave regression fits on the residuals",Mechanism,msa_2504832420
"In contrast to previous methods for sparse additive models , the optimization is finite dimensional and requires no tuning parameters for smoothness",Mechanism,msa_2504832420
"Under appropriate assumptions ,",Method,msa_2504832420
"we prove that the procedure is faithful in the population setting , yielding no false negatives",Findings,msa_2504832420
"We give a finite sample statistical analysis ,",Method,msa_2504832420
and introduce algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2504832420
for efficiently carrying out the required quadratic programs,Purpose,msa_2504832420
Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for practical large-scale equilibrium computation in imperfect-information games,Background,msa_2505491831
"However , imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood , and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known",Purpose,msa_2505491831
"We develop the first general , algorithm-agnostic , solution quality guarantees for Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions , when implemented in the original ( perfect-recall ) game",Mechanism,msa_2505491831
Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions for which any such results have been obtained,Mechanism,msa_2505491831
"Further , our analysis is tighter in two ways , each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound",Mechanism,msa_2505491831
"We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties , the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem , where the increase in our bound is the distance function",Mechanism,msa_2505491831
This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds,Mechanism,msa_2505491831
We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems,Mechanism,msa_2505491831
"If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction , the input forms a metric space , and this immediately yields a $ 2 $ -approximation algorithm for abstraction",Mechanism,msa_2505491831
"Conversely , if this condition is not satisfied , we show that the input does not form a metric space",Mechanism,msa_2505491831
"Finally , we provide computational experiments to evaluate the practical usefulness of the abstraction techniques",Method,msa_2505491831
"With the availability of high resolution digital technology , there has been increased interest in developing statistical and image processing techniques that can enhance the existing capabilities of analyzing works of art for authenticity",Background,msa_2507387377
This work explores the merits of using advanced correlation filters in supplementing art experts efforts,Mechanism,msa_2507387377
in identifying forgeries among disputed paintings,Purpose,msa_2507387377
"We show that by training the optimal trade-off synthetic discriminant function ( OTSDF ) filter on each section of a coarsely parceled image of an original painting ,",Mechanism,msa_2507387377
"we are not only able to distinguish between a low-quality digitized representation of a painting and its forgery , but also specifically indicate where the differences occur and where the replica is particularly faithful to the original",Findings,msa_2507387377
"Abstract SummaryWith the rapid advances in technologies of microarray and massively parallel sequencing , data of multiple omics sources from a large patient cohort are now frequently seen in many consortium studies",Background,msa_2507998592
Effective multi-level omics data integration has brought new statistical challenges,Background,msa_2507998592
"One important biological objective of such integrative analysis is to cluster patients in order to identify clinically relevant disease subtypes , which will form basis for tailored treatment and personalized medicine",Background,msa_2507998592
"Several methods have been proposed in the literature for this purpose , including the popular iCluster method used in many cancer applications",Background,msa_2507998592
"When clustering high-dimensional omics data , effective feature selection is critical for better clustering accuracy and biological interpretation",Background,msa_2507998592
It is also common that a portion of `` scattered samples '' has patterns distinct from all major clusters and should not be assigned into any cluster as they may represent a rare disease subcategory or be in transition between disease subtypes,Background,msa_2507998592
"In this paper , we firstly propose to improve feature selection",Purpose,msa_2507998592
of the iCluster factor model by an overlapping sparse group lasso penalty on the omics features using prior knowledge of inter-omics regulatory flows,Mechanism,msa_2507998592
We then perform regularization over samples to allow clustering with scattered samples and generate tight clusters,Mechanism,msa_2507998592
Computational offloading services at the edge of the Internet for mobile devices are becoming a reality,Background,msa_2508388616
"Using a wide range of mobile applications ,",Mechanism,msa_2508388616
we explore how such infrastructure improves latency and energy consumption relative to the cloud,Purpose,msa_2508388616
We present experimental results,Findings,msa_2508388616
from WiFi and 4G LTE networks,Method,msa_2508388616
Demand response is seeing increased popularity worldwide and industrial loads are actively taking part in this trend,Background,msa_2509044343
"As a host of energy-intensive industrial processes , steel plants have both the motivation and potential to provide demand response",Background,msa_2509044343
"However , the scheduling of steel plants is very complex and the involved computations are intense",Purpose,msa_2509044343
"In this paper , we focus on these difficulties",Purpose,msa_2509044343
and propose methods such as adding cuts and implementing an application-specific branch and bound algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2509044343
"Algorithmic systems that employ machine learning play an increasing role in making substantive decisions in modern society , ranging from online personalization to insurance and credit decisions to predictive policing",Background,msa_2510508396
But their decision-making processes are often opaque -- it is difficult to explain why a certain decision was made,Purpose,msa_2510508396
We develop a formal foundation,Mechanism,msa_2510508396
to improve the transparency of such decision-making systems,Purpose,msa_2510508396
"Specifically , we introduce a family of Quantitative Input Influence ( QII ) measures that capture the degree of influence of inputs on outputs of systems",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
These measures provide a foundation for the design of transparency reports that accompany system decisions ( e,Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", explaining a specific credit decision ) and for testing tools useful for internal and external oversight ( e",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", to detect algorithmic discrimination )",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
"Distinctively , our causal QII measures carefully account for correlated inputs while measuring influence",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
"They support a general class of transparency queries and can , in particular , explain decisions about individuals ( e",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", a loan decision ) and groups ( e",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", disparate impact based on gender )",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
"Finally , since single inputs may not always have high influence , the QII measures also quantify the joint influence of a set of inputs ( e",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", age and income ) on outcomes ( e",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
g,Mechanism,msa_2510508396
loan decisions ) and the marginal influence of individual inputs within such a set ( e,Mechanism,msa_2510508396
", income )",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
"Since a single input may be part of multiple influential sets , the average marginal influence of the input is computed using principled aggregation measures , such as the Shapley value , previously applied to measure influence in voting",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
"Further , since transparency reports could compromise privacy , we explore the transparency-privacy tradeoff and prove that a number of useful transparency reports can be made differentially private with very little addition of noise",Mechanism,msa_2510508396
Our empirical validation with standard machine learning algorithms,Method,msa_2510508396
Cities are increasingly equipped with low-resolution cameras,Background,msa_2510674666
Video from some of these cameras is publicly accessible in real time,Background,msa_2510674666
"In this project , the authors addressed the problem of building a traffic model for parts of the roads visible from publicly accessible cameras",Purpose,msa_2510674666
"In particular , the end goal is to build a model",Mechanism,msa_2510674666
capable of detecting different types of vehicles in images in various weather conditions and times of the day except night,Purpose,msa_2510674666
Multimedia event detection has been receiving increasing attention in recent years,Background,msa_2512252310
"Besides recognizing an event , the discovery of evidences ( which is refered to as `` recounting '' ) is also crucial for user to better understand the searching result",Background,msa_2512252310
"Due to the difficulty of evidence annotation , only limited supervision of event labels are available for training a recounting model",Purpose,msa_2512252310
"To deal with the problem ,",Purpose,msa_2512252310
"we propose a weakly supervised evidence discovery method based on self-paced learning framework , which follows a learning process from easy `` evidences '' to gradually more complex ones , and simultaneously exploit more and more positive evidence samples from numerous weakly annotated video segments",Mechanism,msa_2512252310
"Moreover , to evaluate our method quantitatively , we also propose two metrics , \textit { PctOverlap } and \textit { F1-score } , for measuring the performance of evidence localization specifically",Method,msa_2512252310
The experiments are conducted on a subset of TRECVID MED dataset,Method,msa_2512252310
"Given a large-scale and high-order tensor , how can we find dense blocks in it ? Can we find them in near-linear time but with a quality guarantee ? Extensive previous work has shown that dense blocks in tensors as well as graphs indicate anomalous or fraudulent behavior e",Background,msa_2513234781
", lockstep behavior in social networks",Background,msa_2513234781
"However , available methods for detecting such dense blocks are not satisfactory in terms of speed , accuracy , or flexibility",Purpose,msa_2513234781
"In this work , we propose M-Zoom , a flexible framework",Mechanism,msa_2513234781
"for finding dense blocks in tensors ,",Purpose,msa_2513234781
which works with a broad class of density measures,Mechanism,msa_2513234781
M-Zoom has the following properties : 1 Scalable : M-Zoom scales linearly with all aspects of tensors and is,Mechanism,msa_2513234781
upito 114 $ $ \times $ $ faster than state-of-the-art methods with similar accuracy,Findings,msa_2513234781
2 Provably accurate : M-Zoom provides a guarantee on the lowest density of the blocks it finds,Mechanism,msa_2513234781
3 Flexible : M-Zoom supports multi-block detection and size bounds as well as diverse density measures,Mechanism,msa_2513234781
4 Effective : M-Zoom successfully detected edit wars and bot activities,Findings,msa_2513234781

and spotted network attacks,Findings,msa_2513234781
from a TCP dump,Method,msa_2513234781
"We propose local binary convolution ( LBC ) ,",Mechanism,msa_2513491952
an efficient alternative to convolutional layers in standard convolutional neural networks ( CNN ),Purpose,msa_2513491952
The design principles of LBC are motivated by local binary patterns ( LBP ),Mechanism,msa_2513491952
"The LBC layer comprises of a set of fixed sparse pre-defined binary convolutional filters that are not updated during the training process , a non-linear activation function and a set of learnable linear weights",Mechanism,msa_2513491952
The linear weights combine the activated filter responses to approximate the corresponding activated filter responses of a standard convolutional layer,Mechanism,msa_2513491952
"The LBC layer affords significant parameter savings , 9x to 169x in the number of learnable parameters compared to a standard convolutional layer",Findings,msa_2513491952
"Furthermore , due to lower model complexity and sparse and binary nature of the weights also",Mechanism,msa_2513491952
results in up to 9x to 169x savings in model size compared to a standard convolutional layer,Findings,msa_2513491952
We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally,Method,msa_2513491952
that our local binary convolution layer is a good approximation of a standard convolutional layer,Findings,msa_2513491952

Machine comprehension tests the systems ability to understand a piece of text through a reading comprehension task,Purpose,msa_2514355135
"For this task ,",Purpose,msa_2514355135
we propose an approach using the Abstract Meaning Representation ( AMR ) formalism,Mechanism,msa_2514355135
We construct meaning representation graphs for the given text and for each question-answer pair by merging the AMRs of comprising sentences using cross-sentential phenomena such as coreference and rhetorical structures,Mechanism,msa_2514355135
"Then , we reduce machine comprehension to a graph containment problem",Mechanism,msa_2514355135
We posit that there is a latent mapping of the question-answer meaning representation graph onto the text meaning representation graph that explains the answer,Mechanism,msa_2514355135
"We present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find this mapping ( given a corpus of texts and question-answer pairs ) , and uses what it learns to answer questions on novel texts",Mechanism,msa_2514355135
Rapid advances in biology demand new tools for more active research dissemination and engaged teaching,Background,msa_2516774589
"This paper presents Synteny Explorer , an interactive visualization application designed",Mechanism,msa_2516774589
to let college students explore genome evolution of mammalian species,Purpose,msa_2516774589
"The tool visualizes synteny blocks : segments of homologous DNA shared between various extant species that can be traced back or reconstructed in extinct , ancestral species",Mechanism,msa_2516774589
"We take a karyogram-based approach to create an interactive synteny visualization , leading to a more appealing and engaging design for undergraduate-level genome evolution education",Mechanism,msa_2516774589
"For validation , we conduct three user studies : two focused studies on color and animation design choices and a larger study that performs overall system usability testing while comparing our karyogram-based designs with two more common genome mapping representations in an educational context",Method,msa_2516774589
"While existing views communicate the same information , study participants found the interactive , karyogram-based views much easier and likable to use",Findings,msa_2516774589

we discover that the most recent users ' actions can better reflect users ' current intentions and preferences,Findings,msa_2518632831
"Under this observation , we thereby propose a novel time-decaying online learning algorithm derived from the state-of-the-art FTRL-proximal algorithm , called Time-Decaying Adaptive Prediction ( TDAP ) algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2518632831

An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them without relying on a fully trusted computer,Background,msa_2518782816
We propose several candidate authentication protocols,Mechanism,msa_2518782816
for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer,Purpose,msa_2518782816
-- - a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality,Mechanism,msa_2518782816
Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $ C_i\in [ n ] ^k $,Mechanism,msa_2518782816
The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $ \sigma : [ n ] \rightarrow\mathbb { Z } _d $ and authenticates by computing responses $ f ( \sigma ( C_i ) ) $ to a sequence of public challenges where $ f : \mathbb { Z } _d^k\rightarrow\mathbb { Z } _d $ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate,Mechanism,msa_2518782816
"We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $ m=\tilde { \Omega } ( n^ { s ( f ) } ) $ challenge-response pairs to recover $ \sigma $ , for a security parameter $ s ( f ) $ that depends on two key properties of $ f $",Mechanism,msa_2518782816
"To obtain our results , we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $ f $ and $ \sigma $",Mechanism,msa_2518782816
"Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $ f $ ( not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate ) , and generalize recent results of Feldman et al",Mechanism,msa_2518782816

"To cope with such data , we consider the task of content-based activity recognition in videos without any manually labelled examples , also known as zero-shot video recognition",Purpose,msa_2519055561
"To achieve this , videos are represented in terms of detected visual concepts , which are then scored as relevant or irrelevant according to their similarity with a given textual query",Mechanism,msa_2519055561

Counterfactual Regret Minimization ( CFR ) is the most popular iterative algorithm for solving zero-sum imperfect-information games,Background,msa_2519340588
"Regret-Based Pruning ( RBP ) is an improvement that allows poorly-performing actions to be temporarily pruned , thus speeding up CFR",Background,msa_2519340588

We prove that in zero-sum games it asymptotically prunes any action that is not part of a best response to some Nash equilibrium,Findings,msa_2519340588

"Many applications collect a large number of time series , for example , the financial data of companies quoted in a stock exchange , the health care data of all patients that visit the emergency room of a hospital , or the temperature sequences continuously measured by weather stations across the US",Background,msa_2520179645
These data are often referred to as un structured,Background,msa_2520179645
"The first task in its analytics is to derive a low dimensional representation , a graph or discrete manifold , that describes well the inter relations among the time series and their intra relations across time",Background,msa_2520179645
This paper presents a computationally tractable algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2520179645
for estimating this graph that structures the data,Purpose,msa_2520179645

for challenging event analysis tasks ( e,Purpose,msa_2520861906
", event detection , recognition , and recounting ) in long untrimmed Internet videos ,",Purpose,msa_2520861906
especially when only a few shots/segments are relevant to the event of interest while many other shots are irrelevant or even misleading,Mechanism,msa_2520861906
"The commonly adopted pooling strategies aggregate the shots indifferently in one way or another , resulting in a great loss of information",Mechanism,msa_2520861906
"Instead , in this work we first define a novel notion of semantic saliency that assesses the relevance of each shot with the event of interest",Mechanism,msa_2520861906
We then prioritize the shots according to their saliency scores since shots that are semantically more salient are expected to contribute more to the final event analysis,Mechanism,msa_2520861906
"Next , we propose a new isotonic regularizer that is able to exploit the constructed semantic ordering information",Mechanism,msa_2520861906
The resulting nearly-isotonic support vector machine classifier exhibits higher discriminative power in event analysis tasks,Mechanism,msa_2520861906
"Computationally , we develop an efficient implementation using the proximal gradient algorithm ,",Method,msa_2520861906

"Recently , there has been a surge of interest in using spectral methods for estimating latent variable models",Background,msa_2521512188
"However , it is usually assumed that the distribution of the observations conditioned on the latent variables is either discrete or belongs to a parametric family",Purpose,msa_2521512188
"In this paper , we study the estimation of an $ m $ -state hidden Markov model ( HMM ) with only smoothness assumptions , such as H\ '' olderian conditions , on the emission densities",Method,msa_2521512188
"By leveraging some recent advances in continuous linear algebra and numerical analysis , we develop a computationally efficient spectral algorithm for learning nonparametric HMMs",Mechanism,msa_2521512188
Our technique is based on computing an SVD on nonparametric estimates of density functions by viewing them as \emph { continuous matrices },Mechanism,msa_2521512188

Meeting tail latency Service Level Objectives ( SLOs ) in shared cloud networks is both important and challenging,Background,msa_2521712525
One primary challenge is determining limits on the multi-tenancy such that SLOs are met,Background,msa_2521712525
"Doing so involves estimating latency , which is difficult , especially when tenants exhibit bursty behavior as is common in production environments",Background,msa_2521712525
"Nevertheless , recent papers in the past two years ( Silo , QJump , and PriorityMeister ) show techniques for calculating latency based on a branch of mathematical modeling called Deterministic Network Calculus ( DNC )",Background,msa_2521712525
"The DNC theory is designed for adversarial worst-case conditions , which is sometimes necessary , but is often overly conservative",Background,msa_2521712525
"Typical tenants do not require strict worst-case guarantees , but are only looking for SLOs at lower percentiles ( e",Purpose,msa_2521712525

"SNC-Meister improves upon the state-of-the-art DNC-based systems by using a new theory , Stochastic Network Calculus ( SNC ) , which is designed for tail latency percentiles",Mechanism,msa_2521712525

It enables mining of opinions in video reviews and surveys which are now available aplenty on online platforms like YouTube,Background,msa_2522893818
"However , the limited number of high-quality multimodal sentiment data samples may introduce the problem of the sentiment being dependent on the individual specific features in the dataset",Purpose,msa_2522893818
This results in a lack of generalizability of the trained models for classification on larger online platforms,Purpose,msa_2522893818

Then we propose a Select-Additive Learning ( SAL ) procedure,Mechanism,msa_2522893818

SAL is a two-phase learning method,Mechanism,msa_2522893818
"In Selection phase , it selects the confounding learned representation",Mechanism,msa_2522893818
"In Addition phase , it forces the classifier to discard confounded representations by adding Gaussian noise",Mechanism,msa_2522893818

We offer a new perspective on this problem,Purpose,msa_2522899342

A descending clock auction ( DCA ) is for buying items from multiple sellers,Background,msa_2523038301
The literature has focused on the case where each bidder has two options : to accept or reject the offered price,Background,msa_2523038301
"However , in many settings -- such as the FCC 's imminent incentive auction -- each bidder may be able to sell one from a set of options",Purpose,msa_2523038301
"We present a multi-option DCA ( MDCA ) framework where at each round , the auctioneer offers each bidder different prices for different options , and a bidder may find multiple options still acceptable",Mechanism,msa_2523038301
Setting prices during a MDCA is trickier than in a DCA,Mechanism,msa_2523038301

"In other cases , such as in college sports , knowing the answer to these questions is crucial for shaping the picture of spe- cific contests",Background,msa_2524410802
"In professional sports , sports networks provide power rankings regularly - typically every week or month de- pending on the season length of the league - based on their experts opinion",Background,msa_2524410802

"In brief , our method is based on analyzing a directed network formed between the teams of the corresponding leagues that captures their win-lose relationships",Mechanism,msa_2524410802
"Using data from the National Football League and the National Basketball As- sociation , we show that even simple network theory metrics ( e",Mechanism,msa_2524410802

Describing videos with natural language is one of the ultimate goals of video understanding,Background,msa_2527349934
"Video records multi-modal information including image , motion , aural , speech and so on",Background,msa_2527349934
MSR Video to Language Challenge provides a good chance to study multi-modality fusion in caption task,Purpose,msa_2527349934
"In this paper , we propose the multi-modal fusion encoder and integrate it with text sequence decoder into an end-to-end video caption framework",Mechanism,msa_2527349934
"Features from visual , aural , speech and meta modalities are fused together to represent the video contents",Mechanism,msa_2527349934
Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks ( LSTM-RNNs ) are then used as the decoder to generate natural language sentences,Mechanism,msa_2527349934

Our position is that a key component of securing cyber-physical systems ( CPS ) is to develop a theory of accountability that encompasses both control and computing systems,Purpose,msa_2527709513
We envision that a unified theory of accountability in CPS can be built on a foundation of causal information flow analysis,Mechanism,msa_2527709513
"This theory will support design and analysis of mechanisms at various stages of the accountability regime : attack detection , responsibility-assignment ( e",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
", attack identification or localization ) , and corrective measures ( e",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
", via resilient control ) As an initial step in this direction ,",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
we summarize our results,Findings,msa_2527709513
on attack detection in control systems,Method,msa_2527709513
We use the Kullback-Liebler ( KL ) divergence as a causal information flow measure,Mechanism,msa_2527709513
"We then recover , using information flow analyses , a set of existing results in the literature that were previously proved using different techniques",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
"These results cover passive detection , stealthy attack characterization , and active detection",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
"This research direction is related to recent work on accountability in computational systems [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ]",Mechanism,msa_2527709513
"Electric vehicles ( EVs ) , specifically Battery EVs ( BEVs ) , can offer significant energy and emission savings over internal combustion engine based vehicles",Background,msa_2528075027
Norway has a long history of research and government incentives for BEVs,Background,msa_2528075027
The BEV market and ample data sets in Norway,Method,msa_2528075027
"allow us to fully examine consumers ' BEV choices influenced by car specifications , prices and government incentives ( public bus lanes access , toll waivers and charging stations )",Purpose,msa_2528075027
"To capture the choices of heterogeneous personal consumers and business buyers ,",Purpose,msa_2528075027
we use Random-Coefficient Discrete Choice Model ( referred to BLP model ),Mechanism,msa_2528075027
"Our study is instantiated on the entire BEV sales data in Norway from 2011 to 2013 , as well as demographics information at municipality level",Method,msa_2528075027
We study efficiency and budget balance for designing mechanisms in general quasi-linear domains,Purpose,msa_2528530595
Green and Laffonti ? [ 13 ] proved that one can not generically achieve both,Background,msa_2528530595
We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms that are approximately efficient,Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"For deterministic mechanisms , we show that a strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink agent whose valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative , and she is compensated with the payments made by the other agents",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
We assume the valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval,Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"This result strengthens Green and Laffont 's impossibility result by showing that even in a restricted domain of valuations , there does not exist a mechanism that is strategyproof , budget balanced , and takes every agent 's valuation into consideration -- a corollary of which is that it can not be efficient",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"Using this result , we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof , budget-balanced mechanisms in this domain",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"The bound shows that the inefficiency asymptotically disappears when the number of agents is large -- a result close in spirit to Green and Laffonti ? [ 13 , Theorem 9",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
4 ],Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"However , our results provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"Next , we consider minimizing any convex combination of inefficiency and budget imbalance",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"We show that if the valuations are unrestricted , no deterministic mechanism can do asymptotically better than minimizing inefficiency alone",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"Finally , we investigate randomized mechanisms and provide improved lower bounds on expected inefficiency",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
"We give a tight lower bound for an interesting class of strategyproof , budget-balanced , randomized mechanisms",Mechanism,msa_2528530595
We also use an optimization-based approach -- in the spirit of automated mechanism design -- to provide a lower bound on the minimum achievable inefficiency of any randomized mechanism,Mechanism,msa_2528530595

The Next-Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System ( ACAS X ) is intended to be installed on all large aircraft to give advice to pilots and prevent mid-air collisions with other aircraft,Background,msa_2529440634
It is currently being developed by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ),Background,msa_2529440634
"In this paper , we determine the geometric configurations",Mechanism,msa_2529440634
under which the advice given by ACAS X is safe,Purpose,msa_2529440634
under a precise set of assumptions and,Mechanism,msa_2529440634
formally verify these configurations,Purpose,msa_2529440634
using hybrid systems theorem proving techniques,Mechanism,msa_2529440634
We consider subsequent advisories and show how to adapt our formal verification to take them into account,Mechanism,msa_2529440634
"We examine the current version of the real ACAS X system and discuss some cases where our safety theorem conflicts with the actual advisory given by that version , demonstrating how formal hybrid systems proving approaches are helping to ensure the safety of ACAS X",Mechanism,msa_2529440634
"Low engagement rates and high attrition rates have been formidable challenges for mobile apps and their long-term success , especially for those whose revenues come mainly from in-app purchases",Background,msa_2529452593
"To date , still little is known about how companies can comprehensively identify user engagement stages so as to improve business revenues",Background,msa_2529452593
This paper proposes a structural econometric framework,Mechanism,msa_2529452593
for modeling of consumer latent engagement stages,Purpose,msa_2529452593
that accounts for both the time-varying nature of engagement and consumer forward-looking consumption behavior,Mechanism,msa_2529452593
The present study analyzed a fine-grained mobile tapstream dataset on mobile users ' continuous content consumption behavior in a popular mobile reading app,Method,msa_2529452593
"Our policy simulation enabled us to tailor , based on the model-detected engagement stages , an optimal pricing strategy to each consumer",Mechanism,msa_2529452593
"Interestingly , we found that such an engagement-specific pricing strategy leads , simultaneously , to lower average prices for consumers and higher overall business revenues for the app",Findings,msa_2529452593
"To further evaluate the effectiveness of our method , we conducted a randomized field experiment on a mobile app platform",Method,msa_2529452593
Our experimental results provide more causal evidence that a personalized promotion strategy targeting user engagement stages can both decrease costs to app users and enhance overall business performance,Findings,msa_2529452593
An increasingly prevalent technique for improving response time in queueing systems is the use of redundancy,Background,msa_2529563594
"In a system with redundant requests , each job that arrives to the system is copied and dispatched to multiple servers",Background,msa_2529563594
"As soon as the first copy completes service , the job is considered complete , and all remaining copies are deleted",Background,msa_2529563594
A great deal of empirical work has demonstrated that redundancy can significantly reduce response time in systems ranging from Google 's BigTable service to kidney transplant waitlists,Purpose,msa_2529563594
"We propose a theoretical model of redundancy , the Redundancy- d system , in which each job sends redundant copies to d servers chosen uniformly at random",Mechanism,msa_2529563594
We derive the first exact expressions for mean response time in Redundancy-d systems with any finite number of servers,Mechanism,msa_2529563594

"Design/methodology/approach Three studies examined how informing consumers they may ( reversible condition ) or may not ( irreversible condition ) revise their personal information in the future affected their propensity to disclose personal information , compared to a control condition",Method,msa_2529828229
Findings,Findings,msa_2529828229
Study 1 ( which included three experiments with different time intervals between initial and revised disclosure ),Method,msa_2529828229
"showed that consumers disclose less in both the reversible and irreversible conditions , compared to the control condition",Findings,msa_2529828229
Studies 2 and 3,Method,msa_2529828229
"showed that this is because consumers treat reversibility as a cue to the sensitivity of the information they are asked to divulge , and that leads them to disclose less when reversibility or irreversibility is made explicitly salient beforehand",Findings,msa_2529828229
We study the performance of linear solvers for graph Laplacians based on the combinatorial cycle adjustment methodology proposed by [ Kelner-Orecchia-Sidford-Zhu STOC-13 ],Purpose,msa_2530103166
The approach finds a dual flow solution to this linear system through a sequence of flow adjustments along cycles,Background,msa_2530103166
We study both data structure oriented and recursive methods,Mechanism,msa_2530103166
for handling these adjustments,Purpose,msa_2530103166
"The primary difficulty faced by this approach , updating and querying long cycles , motivated us to study an important special case : instances where all cycles are formed by fundamental cycles on a length $ n $ path",Mechanism,msa_2530103166
This paper studies an attacker against a cyber-physical system ( CPS ),Mechanism,msa_2530103553
whose goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while ensuring that his or her probability of being detected does not exceed a given bound,Purpose,msa_2530103553
The attacker 's probability of being detected is related to the nonnegative bias induced by his or her attack on the CPS ' detection statistic,Mechanism,msa_2530103553
We formulate a linear quadratic cost function that captures the attacker 's control goal and establish constraints on the induced bias that reflect the attacker 's detection-avoidance objectives,Mechanism,msa_2530103553
"When the attacker is constrained to be detected at the false-alarm rate of the detector , we show that the optimal attack strategy reduces to a linear feedback of the attacker 's state estimate",Mechanism,msa_2530103553
"In the case that the attacker 's bias is upper bounded by a positive constant , we provide two algorithms -- an optimal algorithm and a sub-optimal , less computationally intensive algorithm --",Mechanism,msa_2530103553
to find suitable attack sequences,Purpose,msa_2530103553

Real-time virtualization techniques have been investigated with the primary goal of consolidating multiple real-time systems onto a single hardware platform while ensuring timing predictability,Background,msa_2531496768
"However , a shared last-level cache ( LLC ) on recent multi-core platforms can easily hamper timing predictability due to the resulting temporal interference among consolidated workloads",Background,msa_2531496768
"Since such interference caused by the LLC is highly variable and may have not even existed in legacy systems to be consolidated , it poses a significant challenge for real-time virtualization",Purpose,msa_2531496768
"In this paper , we propose a real-time cache management framework",Mechanism,msa_2531496768
for multi-core virtualization,Purpose,msa_2531496768
"Our framework introduces two hypervisor-level techniques , vLLC and vColoring , that enable the cache allocation of individual tasks running in a virtual machine ( VM ) , which is not achievable by the current state of the art",Mechanism,msa_2531496768
"Our framework also provides a cache management scheme that determines cache allocation to tasks , designs VMs in a cache-aware manner , and minimizes the aggregated utilization of VMs to be consolidated",Mechanism,msa_2531496768
"As a proof of concept , we implemented vLLC and vColoring in the KVM hypervisor running on x86 and ARM multi-core platforms",Method,msa_2531496768
Experimental,Method,msa_2531496768
results,Findings,msa_2531496768
"with three different guest OSs , namely Linux/RK , vanilla Linux and MS Windows Embedded ,",Method,msa_2531496768
"When navigating indoors , blind people are often unaware of key visual information , such as posters , signs , and exit doors",Background,msa_2533106976
Our VizMap system uses computer vision and crowdsourcing,Mechanism,msa_2533106976
to collect this information and make it available non-visually,Purpose,msa_2533106976
VizMap starts with videos taken by on-site sighted volunteers and uses these to create a 3D spatial model,Mechanism,msa_2533106976
These video frames are semantically labeled by remote crowd workers with key visual information,Mechanism,msa_2533106976
"These semantic labels are located within and embedded into the reconstructed 3D model , forming a query-able spatial representation of the environment",Mechanism,msa_2533106976
"VizMap can then localize the user with a photo from their smartphone , and enable them to explore the visual elements that are nearby",Mechanism,msa_2533106976
We explore a range of example applications enabled by our reconstructed spatial representation,Method,msa_2533106976
Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) was recently employed in the HCI domain to detect hand gestures using an instrumented smartwatch,Background,msa_2533819212
"This prior work demonstrated great promise for non-invasive , high accuracy recognition of gestures for interactive control",Background,msa_2533819212
We introduce a new system,Mechanism,msa_2533819212
that offers improved sampling speed and resolution,Purpose,msa_2533819212
"In turn , this enables superior interior reconstruction and gesture recognition",Mechanism,msa_2533819212
"More importantly , we use our new system as a vehicle for experimentation ' we compare two EIT sensing methods and three different electrode resolutions",Method,msa_2533819212
Results from in-depth empirical evaluations and a user study,Method,msa_2533819212
We present,Mechanism,msa_2534174629
a novel data classifier,Purpose,msa_2534174629
that is based on the regularization of graph signals,Mechanism,msa_2534174629
Our approach is based on the theory of discrete signal processing on graphs where the graph represents similarities between data and we interpret labels for the dataset elements as a signal indexed by the nodes of the graph,Mechanism,msa_2534174629
We postulate that true labels form a low-frequency graph signal and the classifier finds the smoothest graph signal that satisfies constraints given by known data labels,Mechanism,msa_2534174629
Our experiments,Method,msa_2534174629
"Existing smartwatches rely on touchscreens for display and input , which inevitably leads to finger occlusion and confines interactivity to a small area",Purpose,msa_2535066354
"In this work , we introduce AuraSense ,",Mechanism,msa_2535066354
"which enables rich , around-device , smartwatch interactions",Purpose,msa_2535066354
using electric field sensing as an adapted device,Mechanism,msa_2535066354
"To explore how this sensing approach could enhance smartwatch interactions , we considered different antenna configurations and how they could enable useful interaction modalities",Method,msa_2535066354
"We identified four configurations that can support six well-known modalities of particular interest and utility , including gestures above or in close proximity to watches , and touchscreen-like finger tracking on the skin",Mechanism,msa_2535066354
"We quantify the feasibility of these input modalities ,",Method,msa_2535066354
We propose a geodesic distance on a Grassmannian manifold,Mechanism,msa_2535548842
"that can be used to quantify the shape progression patterns of the bilateral hippocampi , amygdalas , and lateral ventricles in healthy control ( HC ) , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD )",Purpose,msa_2535548842
Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans of 754 subjects ( 3092 scans in total ) were used in this study,Method,msa_2535548842
"Longitudinally , the geodesic distance was found to be proportional to the elapsed time separating the two scans in question",Findings,msa_2535548842
"Cross-sectionally , utilizing a linear mixed-effects statistical model ,",Mechanism,msa_2535548842
"The world is full of physical interfaces that are inaccessible to blind people , from microwaves and information kiosks to thermostats and checkout terminals",Background,msa_2535830051
"Blind people can not independently use such devices without at least first learning their layout , and usually only after labeling them with sighted assistance",Background,msa_2535830051
We introduce VizLens - an accessible mobile application and supporting backend that can robustly and interactively,Mechanism,msa_2535830051
help blind people use nearly any interface they encounter,Purpose,msa_2535830051
"VizLens users capture a photo of an inaccessible interface and send it to multiple crowd workers , who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface to make subsequent computer vision easier",Mechanism,msa_2535830051
"The VizLens application helps users recapture the interface in the field of the camera , and uses computer vision to interactively describe the part of the interface beneath their finger ( updating 8 times per second )",Mechanism,msa_2535830051
We show that VizLens provides accurate and usable real-time feedback,Findings,msa_2535830051
"in a study with 10 blind participants ,",Method,msa_2535830051
"and our crowdsourcing labeling workflow was fast ( 8 minutes ) , accurate ( 99",Findings,msa_2535830051
"7 % ) , and cheap ( $ 1",Findings,msa_2535830051
15 ),Findings,msa_2535830051
"We then explore extensions of VizLens that allow it to ( i ) adapt to state changes in dynamic interfaces , ( ii ) combine crowd labeling with OCR technology to handle dynamic displays , and ( iii ) benefit from head-mounted cameras",Mechanism,msa_2535830051
"VizLens robustly solves a long-standing challenge in accessibility by deeply integrating crowdsourcing and computer vision ,",Mechanism,msa_2535830051
We propose a nonlinear dynamic model for an invasive electroencephalogram analysis,Mechanism,msa_2537852708
that learns the optimal parameters of the neural population model,Purpose,msa_2537852708
via the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2537852708
We introduce the crucial windows where the estimated parameters present patterns before seizure onset,Mechanism,msa_2537852708
The optimal parameters minimizes the error between the observed signal and the generated signal by the model,Mechanism,msa_2537852708
The proposed approach effectively discriminates between healthy signals and epileptic seizure signals,Mechanism,msa_2537852708
We evaluate the proposed method using an electroencephalogram dataset with normal and epileptic seizure sequences,Method,msa_2537852708
The empirical results show that the patterns of parameters as a seizure approach and the method is efficient in analyzing nonlinear epilepsy electroencephalogram data,Findings,msa_2537852708
The accuracy of estimating the optimal parameters is improved by using the nonlinear dynamic model,Findings,msa_2537852708
"Smartwatches and wearables are unique in that they reside on the body , presenting great potential for always-available input and interaction",Background,msa_2538172027
Their position on the wrist makes them ideal for capturing bio-acoustic signals,Background,msa_2538172027
We developed a custom smartwatch kernel,Mechanism,msa_2538172027
that boosts the sampling rate of a smartwatch 's existing accelerometer to 4 kHz,Purpose,msa_2538172027
"Using this new source of high-fidelity data , we uncovered a wide range of applications",Method,msa_2538172027
"For example , we can use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks , claps , scratches , and taps , which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities",Mechanism,msa_2538172027
"Bio-acoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects , enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-aware functionality",Mechanism,msa_2538172027
"Finally , we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer , and show that data can be transmitted through the human body",Mechanism,msa_2538172027
"Given `` who-trusts/distrusts-whom '' information , how can we propagate the trust and distrust ? With the appearance of fraudsters in social network sites , the importance of trust prediction has increased",Background,msa_2539413804
Most such methods use only explicit and implicit trust information ( e,Purpose,msa_2539413804
", if Smith likes several of Johnson 's reviews , then Smith implicitly trusts Johnson ) , but they do not consider distrust",Purpose,msa_2539413804
"In this paper , we propose PIN -TRUST , a novel method",Mechanism,msa_2539413804
"to handle all three types of interaction information : explicit trust , implicit trust , and explicit distrust",Purpose,msa_2539413804
"The novelties of our method are the following : ( a ) it is carefully designed , to take into account positive , implicit , and negative information , ( b ) it is scalable ( i",Mechanism,msa_2539413804
", linear on the input size ) , ( c ) most importantly , it is effective and accurate",Mechanism,msa_2539413804
"Our extensive experiments with a real dataset , Epinions",Method,msa_2539413804
"com data , of 100K nodes and 1M edges ,",Method,msa_2539413804
"Many applications in speech , robotics , finance , and biology deal with sequential data , where ordering matters and recurrent structures are common",Background,msa_2542136887
"However , this structure can not be easily captured by standard kernel functions",Purpose,msa_2542136887
"To model such structure ,",Purpose,msa_2542136887
we propose expressive closed-form kernel functions for Gaussian processes,Mechanism,msa_2542136887
"The resulting model , GP-LSTM , fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory ( LSTM ) recurrent networks , while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes",Mechanism,msa_2542136887
We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic procedure and exploit the structure of these kernels for fast and scalable training and prediction,Mechanism,msa_2542136887
"We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks , and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application ,",Method,msa_2542136887

"As mobile computing and cloud computing converge , the sensing and interaction capabilities of mobile devices can be seamlessly fused with compute-intensive and data-intensive processing in the cloud",Background,msa_2546457897
"Cloudlets are important architectural components in this convergence , representing the middle tier of a mobile device cloudlet cloud hierarchy",Background,msa_2546457897
We show how cloudlets enable a new genre of applications called cognitive assistance applications that augment human perception and cognition,Purpose,msa_2546457897
We describe a plug-and-play architecture,Mechanism,msa_2546457897
for cognitive assistance,Purpose,msa_2546457897
"In the human genome , distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proximal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions",Background,msa_2546542913
"However , although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide , it is still largely unknown whether there are sequence-level instructions encoded in our genome that help govern such interactions",Purpose,msa_2546542913
Here we report a new computational method ( named `` SPEID '' ) using deep learning models,Mechanism,msa_2546542913
to predict enhancer-promoter interactions,Purpose,msa_2546542913
"based on sequence-based features only , when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given",Mechanism,msa_2546542913
Our results across six different cell types,Method,msa_2546542913
demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that use non-sequence features from functional genomic signals,Findings,msa_2546542913
Sensorized commercial buildings are a rich target for building a new class of applications that improve operational and energy efficiency of building operations that take into account human activities,Background,msa_2546935640
"Such applications , however , rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema that would enable porting these applications and systems to different buildings",Purpose,msa_2546935640
"Our demo presents Brick [ 4 ] , a uniform schema",Mechanism,msa_2546935640
for representing metadata in buildings,Purpose,msa_2546935640
"Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors , subsystems and relationships among them , which enables portable applications",Mechanism,msa_2546935640
"Using a web application , we will demonstrate real buildings that have been mapped to the Brick schema , and",Method,msa_2546935640
show application queries that extracts relevant metadata from these buildings,Findings,msa_2546935640
"In this paper , we present a platform",Mechanism,msa_2547105692
designed for low-power real-time sensing of the number of occupants in indoor spaces,Purpose,msa_2547105692
The system transmits a wide-band ultrasonic signal into a room and then processes the superposition of the reflections recorded by a microphone,Mechanism,msa_2547105692
"The system has two modes of operation , one for presence detection and one for estimating the number of occupants in a region",Mechanism,msa_2547105692
The presence detection uses the difference between multiple transmissions in succession with a set of general classifiers that make a binary decision about if the room contains occupants,Mechanism,msa_2547105692
We then use a semi-supervised learning approach based on Weighted Principal Component Analysis ( WPCA ) that requires minimal training data to estimate the number of occupants,Mechanism,msa_2547105692
We also present the design of an energy harvesting embedded platform and,Mechanism,msa_2547105692
demonstrate that our algorithm can continuously execute using energy harvested from indoor solar panels,Findings,msa_2547105692
The platform has a dual Bluetooth Low-Energy and 802,Mechanism,msa_2547105692

4 interface to communicate with a gateway or nearby mobile phone that runs an interface that aids in collecting training data,Mechanism,msa_2547105692
We evaluate our algorithm on a wide-variety of indoor spaces as well as benchmark the hardware in terms of sampling rate given an energy budget,Method,msa_2547105692
"On more than three weeks of data ,",Method,msa_2547105692
Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications from a number of areas : from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to improved human interactions in built environments,Background,msa_2547405038
"While technological advances have been made in these areas , such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings",Background,msa_2547405038
"Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes , but fail to capture the set of relationships and entities required by real applications",Purpose,msa_2547405038
"Building upon these works ,",Purpose,msa_2547405038
"this paper describes Brick , a uniform schema",Mechanism,msa_2547405038
for representing metadata in buildings,Purpose,msa_2547405038
"Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors , subsystems and relationships among them , which enables portable applications",Mechanism,msa_2547405038
We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick,Findings,msa_2547405038
Several generations of inexpensive depth cameras have opened the possibility for new kinds of interaction on everyday surfaces,Background,msa_2547852735
"A number of research systems have demonstrated that depth cameras , combined with projectors for output , can turn nearly any reasonably flat surface into a touch-sensitive display",Background,msa_2547852735
"However , even with the latest generation of depth cameras , it has been difficult to obtain sufficient sensing fidelity across a table-sized surface to get much beyond a proof-of-concept demonstration",Purpose,msa_2547852735
"In this paper we present DIRECT ,",Mechanism,msa_2547852735
a novel touch-tracking algorithm,Purpose,msa_2547852735
that merges depth and infrared imagery captured by a commodity sensor,Mechanism,msa_2547852735
"This yields significantly better touch tracking than from depth data alone , as well as any prior system",Mechanism,msa_2547852735
"Further extending prior work , DIRECT supports arbitrary user orientation and requires no prior calibration or background capture",Mechanism,msa_2547852735
We describe the implementation of our system and,Mechanism,msa_2547852735
"quantify its accuracy through a comparison study of previously published , depth-based touch-tracking algorithms",Method,msa_2547852735
"In this demonstration we present Pulsar , a speed-of-light propagation-aware time synchronization platform",Mechanism,msa_2547936469
Pulsar uses ultra-wideband ( UWB ) radios for time transfer with each node backed by a chip scale atomic clock ( CSAC ) that in combination are able,Mechanism,msa_2547936469
to provide accuracy on the order of 10 's of nanoseconds for indoor applications,Purpose,msa_2547936469
The demonstration will show two Pulsar boards,Method,msa_2547936469
generating a tightly synchronized PPS output that is able to adjust for the distance between the nodes,Findings,msa_2547936469
"Even without communication , the devices maintain synchronization over multiple seconds",Findings,msa_2547936469
Cohesion and structural equivalence are two competing network models to explain diffusion of innovation,Background,msa_2548482986
The dispute of which model plays a more influential role has not been resolved,Purpose,msa_2548482986
This paper attempts to reconcile this problem in a large network setting adoption of caller ringback tone ( CRBT ) in a cellular telephone conversation network,Purpose,msa_2548482986
"Since this societal scale network is very large , we use a novel technique",Mechanism,msa_2548482986
to extract multiple densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network,Purpose,msa_2548482986
"We found subpopulation size in such million-node network only falls in two levels , 200 and 500 , in the extraction step",Findings,msa_2548482986
"Using a new auto-probit model with network terms ,",Mechanism,msa_2548482986
we then compare the competing influences of cohesion and structural equivalence on each of the subpopulation extracted,Method,msa_2548482986
Finally we use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations,Method,msa_2548482986
"To respond to environmental changes , such as drought , plants must regulate numerous cellular processes",Background,msa_2548592136
"Working in the model plant Arabidopsis , Song et al",Mechanism,msa_2548592136
profiled the binding of 21 transcription factors to chromatin and,Mechanism,msa_2548592136
mapped the complex gene regulatory networks involved in the response to the plant hormone abscisic acid,Purpose,msa_2548592136
"In this paper we introduce BOLT , a novel approach",Mechanism,msa_2548908563
for the problem of energy disaggregation,Purpose,msa_2548908563
that performs online binary matrix factorization on a sequence of high frequency current cycles collected in a building to infer additive subcomponents of the current signal,Mechanism,msa_2548908563
"The system learns these constituent current waveforms in an unsupervised fashion and , in a subsequent step , seeks to find combinations of these subcomponents that constitute appliances",Mechanism,msa_2548908563
"By doing so , points in time when appliances are active and , to some degree , their power consumption can be estimated by BOLT",Mechanism,msa_2548908563
"Our system treats energy disaggregation as a binary matrix factorization problem and uses a neural network , with binary activations in the one but last layer and a linear output layer , to solve it",Mechanism,msa_2548908563
The algorithmic performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset,Method,msa_2548908563
"Furthermore , we show that , once the model is trained , the algorithm can perform inference",Findings,msa_2548908563
in real-time on inexpensive off-the-shelf and general purpose hardware,Method,msa_2548908563
Deep kernel learning combines the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods with the inductive biases of deep learning architectures,Background,msa_2549019841
We propose a novel deep kernel learning model and stochastic variational inference procedure which generalizes deep kernel learning approaches,Mechanism,msa_2549019841
"to enable classification , multi-task learning , additive covariance structures , and stochastic gradient training",Purpose,msa_2549019841
"Specifically , we apply additive base kernels to subsets of output features from deep neural architectures , and jointly learn the parameters of the base kernels and deep network through a Gaussian process marginal likelihood objective",Mechanism,msa_2549019841
"Within this framework , we derive an efficient form of stochastic variational inference which leverages local kernel interpolation , inducing points , and structure exploiting algebra",Mechanism,msa_2549019841
We show improved performance,Findings,msa_2549019841
"In graph signal processing , the graph adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian commonly define the shift operator",Background,msa_2549624392
The spectral decomposition of the shift operator plays an important role in that the eigenvalues represent frequencies and the eigenvectors provide a spectral basis,Background,msa_2549624392
"This is useful , for example , in the design of filters",Background,msa_2549624392
"However , the graph or network may be uncertain due to stochastic influences in construction and maintenance , and , under such conditions , the eigenvalues of the shift matrix become random variables",Purpose,msa_2549624392
This paper examines the spectral distribution of the eigenvalues of random networks,Purpose,msa_2549624392
"formed by including each link of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph independently with identical probability , a percolation model",Mechanism,msa_2549624392
"Using the stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko for symmetric matrices with independent upper triangular entries , a deterministic distribution is found that asymptotically approximates the empirical spectral distribution of the scaled adjacency matrix for a model with arbitrary parameters",Mechanism,msa_2549624392
The main results characterize the form of the solution to an important system of equations that leads to this deterministic distribution function and significantly reduce the number of equations that must be solved to find the solution for a given set of model parameters,Findings,msa_2549624392
Simulations comparing the expected empirical spectral distributions and the computed deterministic distributions,Method,msa_2549624392
"In this paper , we address the problem of range-based beacon placement given a floor plan to support indoor localization systems",Purpose,msa_2550075934
Existing approaches for trilateration require three or more beacons to determine a unique position solution,Background,msa_2550075934
"We show that with prior knowledge of the map and a model of beacon coverage , it is possible",Mechanism,msa_2550075934
to uniquely localize with only two beacons,Purpose,msa_2550075934
"This not only reduces installation cost by requiring fewer nodes , but can also improve robustness",Mechanism,msa_2550075934
One of the main challenges with respect to beacon placement algorithms is defining a metric for estimating performance,Mechanism,msa_2550075934
We propose augmenting the commonly used Geometric Dilution of Precision ( GDOP ) metric,Mechanism,msa_2550075934
to account for indoor spaces,Purpose,msa_2550075934
We then use this enhanced GDOP metric as part of a toolchain to compare various beacon placement algorithms in terms of coverage and expected accuracy,Method,msa_2550075934
"When applied to a set of real floor plans ,",Method,msa_2550075934
"With the potential to enhance the power system 's operational flexibility in a cost-effective way , demand response is gaining increased attention worldwide",Background,msa_2550505421
Industrial loads such as cement crushing plants consume large amounts of electric energy and therefore are prime candidates for the provision of significant amounts of demand response,Background,msa_2550505421
They have the capability to turn on/off an arbitrary number of their crushers thereby adjusting their electric power consumption,Background,msa_2550505421
"However , the change in power consumption by cement crushing plants and also other industrial loads are often not granular enough to provide valuable ancillary services such as regulation and load following",Purpose,msa_2550505421
"In this paper , we propose a coordination method based on model predictive control",Mechanism,msa_2550505421

Stochastic gradient-based Monte Carlo methods such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics are useful tools for posterior inference on large scale datasets in many machine learning applications,Background,msa_2552704617
These methods scale to large datasets by using noisy gradients calculated using a mini-batch or subset of the dataset,Background,msa_2552704617
"However , the high variance inherent in these noisy gradients degrades performance and leads to slower mixing",Purpose,msa_2552704617
"In this paper , we present techniques",Mechanism,msa_2552704617
"for reducing variance in stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics , yielding novel stochastic Monte Carlo methods that improve performance",Purpose,msa_2552704617
by reducing the variance in the stochastic gradient,Mechanism,msa_2552704617
We show that our proposed method has better theoretical guarantees on convergence rate than stochastic Langevin dynamics,Findings,msa_2552704617
This is complemented by impressive empirical results obtained,Findings,msa_2552704617
"on a variety of real world datasets , and on four different machine learning tasks ( regression , classification , independent component analysis and mixture modeling )",Method,msa_2552704617
We address the problem of estimating core numbers of nodes by reading edges of a large graph stored in external memory,Purpose,msa_2553055811
The core number of a node is the highest k-core in which the node participates,Background,msa_2553055811
"Core numbers are useful in many graph mining tasks , especially ones that involve finding communities of nodes , influential spreaders and dense subgraphs",Background,msa_2553055811
Large graphs often do not fit on the memory of a single machine,Background,msa_2553055811
Existing external memory solutions do not give bounds on the required space,Purpose,msa_2553055811
"In practice , existing solutions also do not scale with the size of the graph",Purpose,msa_2553055811
"We propose NimbleCore , an iterative external-memory algorithm ,",Mechanism,msa_2553055811
which estimates core numbers of nodes,Purpose,msa_2553055811
"using O ( n log d max ) space , where n is the number of nodes and d max is the maximum node-degree in the graph",Mechanism,msa_2553055811

"Conforming to a given inter-agent communication or interaction topology , distributed recursive estimators of the consensus + innovations type are presented in which at every observation sampling epoch the network agents exchange a single round of messages with their communication neighbors and recursively update their local parameter estimates by simultaneously processing the received neighborhood data and the new information ( innovation ) embedded in the observation sample",Mechanism,msa_2553167214
"Under rather weak conditions on the connectivity of the inter-agent communication and a global observability criterion ,",Method,msa_2553167214
it is shown that the proposed algorithms lead to consistent parameter estimates at each agent,Findings,msa_2553167214
"Furthermore , under standard smoothness assumptions on the sensing nonlinearities ,",Method,msa_2553167214
"How can we design a product or movie that will attract , for example , the interest of Pennsylvania adolescents or liberal newspaper critics ? What should be the genre of that movie and who should be in the cast ?",Background,msa_2553600166
"In this work , we seek to identify how we can design new movies with features tailored to a specific user population",Purpose,msa_2553600166
We formulate the movie design as an optimization problem over the inference of user-feature scores and selection of the features that maximize the number of attracted users,Mechanism,msa_2553600166
"Our approach , PNP , is based on a heterogeneous , tripartite graph of users , movies , and features ( e",Mechanism,msa_2553600166
g,Mechanism,msa_2553600166
"actors , directors , genres ) , where users rate movies and features contribute to movies",Mechanism,msa_2553600166
"We learn the preferences by leveraging user similarities defined through different types of relations , and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches , including matrix factorization and other heterogeneous graph-based analysis",Mechanism,msa_2553600166
We evaluate PNP on publicly available real-world data,Method,msa_2553600166
The World Wide Web ( WWW ) has become a rapidly growing platform consisting of numerous sources which provide supporting or contradictory information about claims ( e,Background,msa_2553850906
", `` Chicken meat is healthy '' )",Background,msa_2553850906
"In order to decide whether a claim is true or false , one needs to analyze content of different sources of information on the Web , measure credibility of information sources , and aggregate all these information",Background,msa_2553850906
"This is a tedious process and the Web search engines address only part of the overall problem , viz",Purpose,msa_2553850906
", producing only a list of relevant sources",Purpose,msa_2553850906
"In this paper , we present ClaimEval , a novel and integrated approach which given a set of claims to validate , extracts a set of pro and con arguments from the Web information sources , and jointly",Mechanism,msa_2553850906
estimates credibility of sources and correctness of claims,Purpose,msa_2553850906
"ClaimEval uses Probabilistic Soft Logic ( PSL ) , resulting in a flexible and principled framework which makes it easy to state and incorporate different forms of prior-knowledge",Mechanism,msa_2553850906

"Human-Computer Music Performance for popular music - where musical structure is important , but where musicians often decide on the spur of the moment exactly what the musical form will be - presents many challenges to make computer systems that are flexible and adaptable to human musicians",Background,msa_2556992227
"One particular challenge is that humans easily follow scores and chord charts , adapt these to new performance plans , and understand media locations in musical terms ( beats and measures ) , while computer music systems often use rigid and even numerical representations that are difficult to work with",Purpose,msa_2556992227
"We present new formalisms and representations , and a corresponding implementation ,",Mechanism,msa_2556992227
"In networks such as the smart grid , communication networks , and social networks , local measurements/observations are scattered over a wide geographical area",Background,msa_2557150367
Centralized inference algorithm are based on gathering all the observations at a central processing unit,Background,msa_2557150367
"However , with data explosion and ever-increasing network sizes , centralized inference suffers from large communication overhead , heavy computation burden at the center , and susceptibility to central node failure",Purpose,msa_2557150367
This paper considers inference over networks,Purpose,msa_2557150367
using factor graphs and a distributed inference algorithm based on Gaussian belief propagation,Mechanism,msa_2557150367
The distributed inference involves only local computation of the information matrix and of the mean vector and message passing between neighbors,Mechanism,msa_2557150367
We discover and show,Findings,msa_2557150367
analytically,Method,msa_2557150367
that the message information matrix converges exponentially fast to a unique positive definite limit matrix for arbitrary positive semidefinite initialization,Findings,msa_2557150367

High performance dense linear algebra ( DLA ) libraries often rely on a general matrix multiply ( Gemm ) kernel that is implemented using assembly or with vector intrinsics,Background,msa_2557637097
"In particular , the real-valued Gemm kernels provide the overwhelming fraction of performance for the complex-valued Gemm kernels , along with the entire level-3 BLAS and many of the real and complex LAPACK routines",Background,msa_2557637097
"Thus , achieving high performance for the Gemm kernel translates into a high performance linear algebra stack above this kernel",Background,msa_2557637097
"However , it is a monumental task for a domain expert to manually implement the kernel for every library-supported architecture",Background,msa_2557637097
This leads to the belief that the craft of a Gemm kernel is more dark art than science,Background,msa_2557637097
It is this premise that drives the popularity of autotuning with code generation in the domain of DLA,Background,msa_2557637097
"This paper , instead , focuses on an analytical approach to code generation of the Gemm kernel for different architecture ,",Mechanism,msa_2557637097
in order to shed light on the details or voo-doo required for implementing a high performance Gemm kernel,Purpose,msa_2557637097
"We distill the implementation of the kernel into an even smaller kernel , an outer-product , and analytically determine how available SIMD instructions can be used to compute the outer-product efficiently",Mechanism,msa_2557637097
We codify this approach into a system to automatically generate a high performance SIMD implementation of the Gemm kernel,Mechanism,msa_2557637097
Experimental,Method,msa_2557637097
"Many real-world graphs , such as those that arise from the web , biology and transportation , appear random and without a structure that can be exploited for performance on modern computer architectures",Background,msa_2557693874
"However , these graphs have a scale-free graph topology that can be leveraged for locality",Purpose,msa_2557693874
Existing sparse data formats are not designed to take advantage of this structure,Purpose,msa_2557693874
They focus primarily on reducing storage requirements and improving the cost of certain matrix operations for these large data sets,Background,msa_2557693874
"Therefore , we propose a data structure",Mechanism,msa_2557693874
for storing real-world scale-free graphs,Purpose,msa_2557693874
in a sparse and hierarchical fashion,Mechanism,msa_2557693874
"By maintaining the structure of the graph , we preserve locality in the graph and in the cache",Mechanism,msa_2557693874
For synthetic scale-free graph data,Method,msa_2557693874
We present a novel subset scan method,Mechanism,msa_2558177882
"to detect if a probabilistic binary classifier has statistically significant bias -- over or under predicting the risk -- for some subgroup , and identify the characteristics of this subgroup",Purpose,msa_2558177882
"This form of model checking and goodness-of-fit test provides a way to interpretably detect the presence of classifier bias and poor classifier fit , not just in one or two dimensions of features of a priori interest , but in the space of all possible feature subgroups",Mechanism,msa_2558177882
We use subset scan and parametric bootstrap methods to efficiently address the difficulty of assessing the exponentially many possible subgroups,Mechanism,msa_2558177882
Understanding how brain functions has been an intriguing topic for years,Background,msa_2558178136
"With the recent progress on collecting massive data and developing advanced technology , people have become interested in addressing the challenge of decoding brain wave data into meaningful mind states , with many machine learning models and algorithms being revisited and developed , especially the ones that handle time series data because of the nature of brain waves",Background,msa_2558178136
"However , many of these time series models , like HMM with hidden state in discrete space or State Space Model with hidden state in continuous space , only work with one source of data and can not handle different sources of information simultaneously",Purpose,msa_2558178136
"In this paper , we propose an extension of State Space Model to work with different sources of information together with its learning and inference algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2558178136
We apply this model to decode the mind state of students during lectures based on their brain waves,Method,msa_2558178136
"Abstract This paper presents a Grammar-aware Driver Parsing ( GDP ) algorithm , with deep features ,",Mechanism,msa_2558883996
to provide a novel driver behavior situational awareness system ( DB-SAW ),Purpose,msa_2558883996
A deep model is first trained to extract highly discriminative features of the driver,Mechanism,msa_2558883996
"Then , a grammatical structure on the deep features is defined to be used as prior knowledge for a semi-supervised proposal candidate generation",Mechanism,msa_2558883996
The Region with Convolutional Neural Networks ( R-CNN ) method is ultimately utilized to precisely segment parts of the driver,Mechanism,msa_2558883996

Recent computer systems research has proposed using redundant requests to reduce latency,Background,msa_2560441213
The idea is to replicate a request so that it joins the queue at multiple servers,Background,msa_2560441213
The request is considered complete as soon as any one copy of the request completes,Background,msa_2560441213
"Redundancy is beneficial because it allows us to overcome server-side variability the fact that the server we choose might be temporarily slow due to factors such as background load , network interrupts , and garbage collection",Background,msa_2560441213
"When there is significant server-side variability , replicating requests can greatly reduce response times",Background,msa_2560441213
"In the past few years , queueing theorists have begun to study redundancy , first via approximations , and , more recently , via exact analysis",Background,msa_2560441213
"Unfortunately , for analytical tractability , most existing theoretical analysis has assumed an Independent Runtimes ( IR ) model , wherein the replicas of a job each experience independent runtimes ( service times ) at different servers",Background,msa_2560441213
The IR model is unrealistic and has led to theoretical results which can be at odds with computer systems implementation results,Purpose,msa_2560441213
This paper introduces a much more realistic model of redundancy,Mechanism,msa_2560441213
Our model allows us,Mechanism,msa_2560441213
"to decouple the inherent job size ( X ) from the server-side slowdown ( S ) ,",Purpose,msa_2560441213
where we track both S and X for each job,Mechanism,msa_2560441213
"Analysis within the S & X model is , of course , much more difficult",Mechanism,msa_2560441213
"Nevertheless , we design a policy , Redundant-to-Idle-Queue ( RIQ ) which is both analytically tractable within the S & X model",Mechanism,msa_2560441213
"The kernel trick becomes a burden for some machine learning tasks such as dictionary learning , where a huge amount of training samples are needed , making the kernel matrix gigantic and infeasible to store or process",Background,msa_2561727400
"In this work , we propose to alleviate this problem and achieve Gaussian RBF kernel expansion explicitly for dictionary learning using Fastfood transform , which is an approximation of full kernel expansion",Purpose,msa_2561727400
"We have shown , in the context of missing data recovery through joint dictionary learning i",Mechanism,msa_2561727400
e,Mechanism,msa_2561727400
"periocular-based full face hallucination , that the approximated kernel expansion using Fastfood transform for joint dictionary learning",Mechanism,msa_2561727400
yields much better results than its image space counterparts,Findings,msa_2561727400
Policy approaches for addressing emerging consumer privacy concerns increasingly rely on providing consumers with more information and control over the usage of their personal data,Background,msa_2562123916
"In three experiments ,",Method,msa_2562123916
we evaluate the efficacy of such mechanisms in the face of subtle but common variation in the presentation of privacy choices to consumers,Purpose,msa_2562123916
"We find that consumers decision frames and thus , their propensity to select privacy protective alternatives can be subtly but powerfully influenced by commonplace heterogeneity in the presentation of privacy choices",Findings,msa_2562123916
Counterfactual Regret Minimization ( CFR ) is a popular iterative algorithm for approximating Nash equilibria in imperfect-information multi-step two-player zero-sum games,Background,msa_2562576832
"We introduce the first general , principled method",Mechanism,msa_2562576832
for warm starting CFR,Purpose,msa_2562576832
"Our approach requires only a strategy for each player , and accomplishes the warm start at the cost of a single traversal of the game tree",Mechanism,msa_2562576832
"The method provably warm starts CFR to as many iterations as it would have taken to reach a strategy profile of the same quality as the input strategies , and does not alter the convergence bounds of the algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2562576832
"Unlike prior approaches to warm starting , ours can be applied in all cases",Mechanism,msa_2562576832
Our method is agnostic to the origins of the input strategies,Mechanism,msa_2562576832
"For example , they can be based on human domain knowledge , the observed strategy of a strong agent , the solution of a coarser abstraction , or the output of some algorithm that converges rapidly at first but slowly as it gets closer to an equilibrium",Mechanism,msa_2562576832
Experiments,Method,msa_2562576832
Long-standing policy approaches to privacy protection are centered on consumer notice and control and assume that privacy decision making is a deliberative process of comparison between costs and benefits from information disclosure,Background,msa_2562688705
"An emerging body of work , however , documents the powerful effects of factors unrelated to objective trade-offs in privacy settings",Background,msa_2562688705
"In this paper , we investigate how focusing on the process by which individuals make privacy choices can help explain the impact of rational and behavioral factors on privacy decision making",Purpose,msa_2562688705
"In an online experiment , we borrow from query-theory literature and measure individuals ' considerations ( that is , queries ) across manipulations of rational and behavioral factors",Method,msa_2562688705
We find that effects of rational and behavioral factors are associated with differences in the order and valence of queries considered in privacy settings,Findings,msa_2562688705

Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) have enabled a myriad of new applications many of which provide aerial vision-based sensing,Background,msa_2563418176
"In intrusion detection or target tracking applications , it is important to reach a given area of interest in the shortest time , and create an online data streaming connection to a monitoring station for immediate delivery of content to the operator",Background,msa_2563418176

5aural speech by converting it into visual text with less than a five second delay,Background,msa_2566861726
Keeping the delay short 6 allows end-users to follow and participate in conversations,Background,msa_2566861726
This article focuses on the fundamental prob7 lem that makes real-time captioning difficult : sequential keyboard typing is much slower than speaking,Purpose,msa_2566861726
"We 8 first surveyed the audio characteristics of 240 one-hour-long captioned lectures on YouTube , such as speed 9 and duration of speaking bursts",Method,msa_2566861726
"We then analyzed how these characteristics impact caption generation and 10 readability , considering specifically our human-powered collaborative captioning approach",Method,msa_2566861726
We note that 11 most of these characteristics are also present in more general domains,Method,msa_2566861726
"For our caption comparison evalu12 ation , we transcribed a classroom lecture in real-time using all three captioning approaches",Method,msa_2566861726
We recruited 13 48 participants ( 24 DHH ) to watch these classroom transcripts in an eye-tracking laboratory,Method,msa_2566861726
"We presented 14 these captions in a randomized , balanced order",Method,msa_2566861726
We show that both hearing and DHH participants preferred 15 and followed collaborative captions better than those generated by automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) or 16 professionals due to the more consistent flow of the resulting captions,Findings,msa_2566861726
Kidney exchange is a type of barter market where patients exchange willing but incompatible donors,Background,msa_2567090038
"These exchanges are conducted via cycleswhere each incompatible patient-donor pair in the cycle both gives and receives a kidneyand chains , which are started by an altruist donor who does not need a kidney in return",Background,msa_2567090038
Finding the best combination of cycles and chains is hard,Purpose,msa_2567090038
The leading algorithms for this optimization problem use either branch and pricea combination of branch and bound and column generationor constraint generation,Purpose,msa_2567090038
We show a correctness error in the leading prior branch-and-price-based approach [ Glorie et al,Purpose,msa_2567090038
2014 ],Purpose,msa_2567090038
We develop a provably correct,Mechanism,msa_2567090038
"fix to it ,",Purpose,msa_2567090038
"which also necessarily changes the algorithm 's complexity , as well as other improvements to the search algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2567090038
"Next , we compare our solver to the leading constraint-generation-based solver and to the best prior correct branch-and-price-based solver",Method,msa_2567090038
We focus on the setting where chains have a length cap,Method,msa_2567090038
"A cap is desirable in practice since if even one edge in the chain fails , the rest of the chain fails : the cap precludes very long chains that are extremely unlikely to execute and instead causes the solution to have more parallel chains and cycles that are more likely to succeed",Mechanism,msa_2567090038
"We work with the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange , which uses a chain cap",Mechanism,msa_2567090038
Algorithms from our group autonomously make the transplant plans for that exchange,Findings,msa_2567090038

in an extremely harsh broadcast model that relies only on carrier sensing,Mechanism,msa_2568091325
The model consists of an anonymous broadcast network in which nodes have no knowledge about the topology of the network or even an upper bound on its size,Mechanism,msa_2568091325
"Furthermore , it is assumed that an adversary chooses at which time slot each node wakes up",Mechanism,msa_2568091325
"At each time slot a node can either beep , that is , emit a signal , or be silent",Mechanism,msa_2568091325
"At a particular time slot , beeping nodes receive no feedback , while silent nodes can only differentiate between none of its neighbors beeping , or at least one of its neighbors beeping",Mechanism,msa_2568091325
We start by proving a lower bound,Method,msa_2568091325
"that shows that in this model , it is not possible to locally converge to an MIS in sub-polynomial time",Findings,msa_2568091325
We then study four different relaxations of the model,Method,msa_2568091325
which allow us to circumvent the lower bound and find an MIS in polylogarithmic time,Findings,msa_2568091325
"First , we show that if a polynomial upper bound on the network size is known ,",Method,msa_2568091325
it is possible to find an MIS in \ ( \mathcal O ( \log ^3 n ) \ ) time,Findings,msa_2568091325
"Second , if we assume sleeping nodes are awoken by neighboring beeps",Method,msa_2568091325
", then we can also find an MIS in \ ( \mathcal O ( \log ^3 n ) \ ) time",Findings,msa_2568091325
"Third , if in addition to this wakeup assumption we allow sender-side collision detection , that is , beeping nodes can distinguish whether at least one neighboring node is beeping concurrently or not ,",Method,msa_2568091325
we can find an MIS in \ ( \mathcal O ( \log ^2 n ) \ ) time,Findings,msa_2568091325
"Finally , if instead we endow nodes with synchronous clocks ,",Method,msa_2568091325

This paper studies attackers with control objectives and explicit detection constraints against cyber-physical systems,Purpose,msa_2569001686
The cyber-physical system is equipped with a Kalman filter and an attack detector that uses the innovations process of the Kalman filter,Mechanism,msa_2569001686
The attacker performs an integrity attack on the actuators and sensors of the system with the aim of moving the system to a target state under the constraint that the probability of him or her being detected is equal to the false alarm probability of the attack detector,Mechanism,msa_2569001686
We formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem,Mechanism,msa_2569001686
that gives the optimal sequence of attacks,Purpose,msa_2569001686
and demonstrate our attack strategy,Findings,msa_2569001686
Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems ( CPS ) and the Internet of Things ( IoT ),Background,msa_2570678867
"Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols , it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy",Background,msa_2570678867
"However , applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time , and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application",Background,msa_2570678867
"Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications , running on commodity platforms and operating systems , it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack",Purpose,msa_2570678867
"We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time ( QoT ) that captures metrics such as resolution , accuracy , and stability",Mechanism,msa_2570678867
"Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty , and where time synchronization balances applications ' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth",Mechanism,msa_2570678867
"Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time , with a desired accuracy and resolution",Mechanism,msa_2570678867
The timeline abstraction enables developers,Mechanism,msa_2570678867
to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space,Purpose,msa_2570678867
"Leveraging open source hardware and software components , we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform",Method,msa_2570678867
Topic models represent latent topics as probability distributions over words which can be hard to interpret due to the lack of grounded semantics,Purpose,msa_2572434179
"In this paper , we propose a structured topic representation based on an entity taxonomy from a knowledge base",Mechanism,msa_2572434179
A probabilistic model is developed,Mechanism,msa_2572434179
to infer both hidden topics and entities from text corpora,Purpose,msa_2572434179
Each topic is equipped with a random walk over the entity hierarchy to extract semantically grounded and coherent themes,Mechanism,msa_2572434179
Accurate entity modeling is achieved by leveraging rich textual features from the knowledge base,Mechanism,msa_2572434179
Experiments,Method,msa_2572434179
"show significant superiority of our approach in topic perplexity and key entity identification ,",Findings,msa_2572434179
Formative assessments allow learners to quickly identify knowledge gaps,Background,msa_2572789406
"In traditional educational settings , expert instructors can create assessments , but in informal learning environment , it is difficult for novice learners to self assess because they do n't know what they do n't know",Purpose,msa_2572789406
"This paper introduces Questimator , an automated system that generates multiple-choice assessment questions for any topic contained within Wikipedia",Mechanism,msa_2572789406
"Given a topic , Questimator traverses the Wikipedia graph to find and rank related topics , and uses article text to form questions , answers and distractor options",Mechanism,msa_2572789406
"In a study with 833 participants from Mechanical Turk ,",Method,msa_2572789406
we found that participants ' scores on Questimator-generated quizzes correlated well with their scores on existing online quizzes on topics ranging from philosophy to economics,Findings,msa_2572789406
Also Questimator generates questions with comparable discriminatory power as existing online quizzes,Findings,msa_2572789406
Concurrent C0 is an imperative programming language in the C family with session-typed message-passing concurrency,Background,msa_2573046570
The previously proposed semantics implements asynchronous ( non-blocking ) output ; we extend it here with non-blocking input,Purpose,msa_2573046570
A key idea is to postpone message reception as much as possible by interpreting receive commands as a request for a message,Mechanism,msa_2573046570
We implemented our ideas as a translation from a blocking intermediate language to a non-blocking language,Mechanism,msa_2573046570
"Finally , we evaluated our techniques with several benchmark programs",Method,msa_2573046570
"We describe Concurrent C0 ,",Mechanism,msa_2573182298
a type-safe C-like language,Purpose,msa_2573182298
with contracts and session-typed communication over channels,Mechanism,msa_2573182298
Concurrent C0 supports an operation called forwarding which allows channels to be combined in a well-defined way,Mechanism,msa_2573182298
The language 's type system enables elegant expression of session types and message-passing concurrent programs,Mechanism,msa_2573182298
We provide a Go-based implementation with language based optimizations,Method,msa_2573182298
Matrix-parametrized models ( MPMs ) are widely used in machine learning ( ML ) applications,Background,msa_2573285109
"In large-scale ML problems , the parameter matrix of a MPM can grow at an unexpected rate , resulting in high communication and parameter synchronization costs",Purpose,msa_2573285109
"To address this issue ,",Purpose,msa_2573285109
"we offer two contributions : first , we develop a computation model for a large family of MPMs , which share the following property : the parameter update computed on each data sample is a rank-1 matrix , i",Mechanism,msa_2573285109
e,Mechanism,msa_2573285109
the outer product of two `` sufficient factors '' ( SFs ),Mechanism,msa_2573285109
"Second , we implement a decentralized , peer-to-peer system , Sufficient Factor Broadcasting ( SFB ) , which broadcasts the SFs among worker machines , and reconstructs the update matrices locally at each worker",Mechanism,msa_2573285109
SFB takes advantage of small rank-1 matrix updates and efficient partial broadcasting strategies to dramatically improve communication efficiency,Mechanism,msa_2573285109
"We propose a graph optimization based partial broadcasting scheme , which minimizes the delay of information dissemination under the constraint that each machine only communicates with a subset rather than all of machines",Mechanism,msa_2573285109
"Furthermore , we provide theoretical analysis",Method,msa_2573285109
to show that SFB guarantees convergence of algorithms ( under full broadcasting ) without requiring a centralized synchronization mechanism,Findings,msa_2573285109
Experiments,Method,msa_2573285109
corroborate SFB 's efficiency,Findings,msa_2573285109
We explore an as yet unexploited opportunity for drastically improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient variational Bayes ( SGVB ) with global model parameters,Purpose,msa_2573360526
"Regular SGVB estimators rely on sampling of parameters once per minibatch of data , and have variance that is constant w",Mechanism,msa_2573360526
t,Mechanism,msa_2573360526
the minibatch size,Mechanism,msa_2573360526
The efficiency of such estimators can be drastically improved upon by translating uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch,Mechanism,msa_2573360526
"Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size , generally leading to much faster convergence",Mechanism,msa_2573360526
"We find an important connection with regularization by dropout : the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise , a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance",Mechanism,msa_2573360526
Our method allows,Mechanism,msa_2573360526
inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors,Purpose,msa_2573360526
"; specifically , we propose \emph { variational dropout } , a generalization of Gaussian dropout , but with a more flexibly parameterized posterior ,",Mechanism,msa_2573360526
often leading to better generalization,Purpose,msa_2573360526
How should one aggregate ordinal preferences expressed by voters into a measurably superior social choice ?,Purpose,msa_2573586242
"A well-established approach -- which we refer to as implicit utilitarian voting -- assumes that voters have latent utility functions that induce the reported rankings , and seeks voting rules that approximately maximize utilitarian social welfare",Background,msa_2573586242
We extend this approach to the design of rules that select a subset of alternatives,Mechanism,msa_2573586242
"We derive analytical bounds on the performance of optimal ( deterministic as well as randomized ) rules in terms of two measures , distortion and regret",Mechanism,msa_2573586242
Empirical,Method,msa_2573586242
"results show that regret-based rules are more compelling than distortion-based rules , leading us to focus on developing a scalable implementation for the optimal ( deterministic ) regret-based rule",Findings,msa_2573586242
This paper considers the definition of the graph Fourier transform ( GFT ) and of the spectral decomposition of graph signals,Purpose,msa_2573721906
Current literature does not address the lack of unicity of the GFT,Purpose,msa_2573721906
The GFT is the mapping from the signal set into its representation by a direct sum of irreducible shift invariant subspaces : 1 ) this decomposition may not be unique ; and 2 ) there is freedom in the choice of basis for each component subspace,Background,msa_2573721906
"These issues are particularly relevant when the graph shift has repeated eigenvalues as is the case in many real-world applications ; by ignoring them , there is no way of knowing if different researchers are using the same definition of the GFT and whether their results are comparable or not",Background,msa_2573721906
The paper presents how to resolve the above degrees of freedom,Purpose,msa_2573721906
We develop a quasi -coordinate free definition of the GFT and graph spectral decomposition of graph signals that we implement through oblique spectral projectors,Mechanism,msa_2573721906
We present properties of the GFT and of the spectral projectors and discuss a generalized Parseval 's inequality,Mechanism,msa_2573721906
An illustrative example,Findings,msa_2573721906
Optical music recognition ( OMR ) is the task of recognizing images of musical scores,Background,msa_2573922645
"In this paper , improved algorithms",Mechanism,msa_2573922645
for the first steps of optical music recognition,Purpose,msa_2573922645
"Computer music systems can interact with humans at different levels , including scores , phrases , notes , beats , and gestures",Background,msa_2575455538
"However , most current systems lack basic musicianship skills",Background,msa_2575455538
"As a consequence , the results of human-computer interaction are often far less musical than the interaction between human musicians",Purpose,msa_2575455538
"In this paper , we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data",Purpose,msa_2575455538
"In particular , we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other",Purpose,msa_2575455538
Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems,Purpose,msa_2575455538
"We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist , learning from rehearsal experience",Mechanism,msa_2575455538
"We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction ,",Mechanism,msa_2575455538
"explore the properties of the learned models , such as dominant features , limits of validity , and minimal training size ,",Method,msa_2575455538
Processes such as disease propagation and information diffusion often spread over some latent network structure which must be learned from observation,Background,msa_2575532943
Given a set of unlabeled training examples representing occurrences of an event type of interest ( e,Purpose,msa_2575532943
", a disease outbreak ) , our goal is to learn a graph structure that can be used to accurately detect future events of that type",Purpose,msa_2575532943
"Motivated by new theoretical results on the consistency of constrained and unconstrained subset scans , we propose a novel framework",Mechanism,msa_2575532943
for learning graph structure from unlabeled data,Purpose,msa_2575532943
by comparing the most anomalous subsets detected with and without the graph constraints,Mechanism,msa_2575532943
"Our framework uses the mean normalized log-likelihood ratio score to measure the quality of a graph structure , and efficiently searches for the highest-scoring graph structure",Mechanism,msa_2575532943
"Using simulated disease outbreaks injected into real-world Emergency Department data from Allegheny County ,",Method,msa_2575532943
We propose an inexact method,Mechanism,msa_2575586770
"for the graph Fourier transform of a graph signal ,",Purpose,msa_2575586770
as defined by the signal decomposition over the Jordan subspaces of the graph adjacency matrix,Mechanism,msa_2575586770
"This method projects the signal over the generalized eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix , which accelerates the transform computation over large , sparse , and directed adjacency matrices",Mechanism,msa_2575586770
The trade-off between execution time and fidelity to the original graph structure is discussed,Mechanism,msa_2575586770
"In addition , properties such as a generalized Parseval 's identity and total variation ordering of the generalized eigenspaces are discussed",Mechanism,msa_2575586770
The method is applied to 2010-2013 NYC taxi trip data to identify traffic hotspots on the Manhattan grid,Method,msa_2575586770
"Design of filters for graph signal processing benefits from knowledge of the spectral decomposition of matrices that encode graphs , such as the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix , used to define the shift operator",Background,msa_2576668423
"For shift matrices with real eigenvalues , which arise for symmetric graphs , the empirical spectral distribution captures the eigenvalue locations",Background,msa_2576668423
"Under realistic circumstances , stochastic influences often affect the network structure and , consequently , the shift matrix empirical spectral distribution",Background,msa_2576668423
"Nevertheless , deterministic functions may often be found to approximate the asymptotic behavior of empirical spectral distributions of random matrices",Background,msa_2576668423
This paper uses stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko,Mechanism,msa_2576668423
"to derive such deterministic equivalent distributions for the empirical spectral distributions of random graphs formed by structured , non-uniform percolation of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph",Purpose,msa_2576668423

Robust principal component analysis PCA is one of the most important dimension-reduction techniques for handling high-dimensional data with outliers,Background,msa_2576902070
"However , most of the existing robust PCA presupposes that the mean of the data is zero and incorrectly utilizes the average of data as the optimal mean of robust PCA",Purpose,msa_2576902070
"In fact , this assumption holds only for the squared -norm-based traditional PCA",Purpose,msa_2576902070
"In this letter , we equivalently reformulate the objective of conventional PCA and learn the optimal projection directions by maximizing the sum of projected difference between each pair of instances based on -norm",Mechanism,msa_2576902070
The proposed method is robust to outliers and also invariant to rotation,Mechanism,msa_2576902070
"More important , the reformulated objective not only automatically avoids the calculation of optimal mean and makes the assumption of centered data unnecessary , but also theoretically connects to the minimization of reconstruction error",Mechanism,msa_2576902070
"To solve the proposed nonsmooth problem , we exploit an efficient optimization algorithm to soften the contributions from outliers by reweighting each data point iteratively",Mechanism,msa_2576902070
We theoretically analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2576902070

Biological adaptation is a powerful mechanism that makes many disorders hard to combat,Background,msa_2577049165
In this paper we study steering such adaptation through sequential planning,Purpose,msa_2577049165
We propose a general approach where we leverage Monte Carlo tree search,Mechanism,msa_2577049165
"to compute a treatment plan ,",Purpose,msa_2577049165
and the biological entity is modeled by a black-box simulator that the planner calls during planning,Mechanism,msa_2577049165
We show that the framework can be used to steer a biological entity modeled via a complex signaling pathway network that has numerous feedback loops that operate at different rates and have hard-to-understand aggregate behavior,Mechanism,msa_2577049165
We apply the framework to steering the adaptation of a patient 's immune system,Mechanism,msa_2577049165
"In particular , we apply it to a leading T cell simulator ( available in the biological modeling package BioNetGen )",Mechanism,msa_2577049165
We run experiments with two alternate goals : developing regulatory T cells or developing effector T cells,Method,msa_2577049165
The former is important for preventing autoimmune diseases while the latter is associated with better survival rates in cancer patients,Method,msa_2577049165
"We are especially interested in the effect of sequential plans , an approach that has not been explored extensively in the biological literature",Method,msa_2577049165
"As publishers gather more information about their users , they can use that information to enable advertisers to create increasingly targeted campaigns",Background,msa_2578907711
This enables better usage of advertising inventory,Background,msa_2578907711
"However , it also dramatically increases the complexity that the publisher faces when optimizing campaign admission decisions and inventory allocation to campaigns",Purpose,msa_2578907711
We develop an optimal anytime algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2578907711
for abstracting fine-grained audience segments into coarser abstract segments that are not too numerous for use in such optimization,Purpose,msa_2578907711
Compared to the segment abstraction algorithm by Walsh et al,Method,msa_2578907711
[ 2010 ] for the same problem,Method,msa_2578907711
", it yields two orders of magnitude improvement in run time and significant improvement in abstraction quality",Findings,msa_2578907711
These benefits hold both for guaranteed and non-guaranteed campaigns,Findings,msa_2578907711
"Learning detectors that can recognize concepts , such as people actions , objects , etc",Background,msa_2578908617
", in video content is an interesting but challenging problem",Background,msa_2578908617
"In this paper , we study the problem of automatically learning detectors from the big video data on the web without any additional manual annotations",Purpose,msa_2578908617
The contextual information available on the web provides noisy labels to the video content,Purpose,msa_2578908617
"To leverage the noisy web labels ,",Purpose,msa_2578908617
we propose a novel method called WEbly-Labeled Learning ( WELL ),Mechanism,msa_2578908617
It is established on two theories called curriculum learning and self-paced learning and exhibits useful properties that can be theoretically verified,Mechanism,msa_2578908617
We provide compelling insights on the latent non-convex robust loss that is being minimized on the noisy data,Mechanism,msa_2578908617
"In addition , we propose two novel techniques that not only enable WELL to be applied to big data but also lead to more accurate results",Mechanism,msa_2578908617
The efficacy and the scalability of WELL have been extensively demonstrated,Findings,msa_2578908617
"on two public benchmarks , including the largest multimedia dataset and the largest manually-labeled video set",Method,msa_2578908617
Experimental results show that WELL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods,Findings,msa_2578908617
"State-of-the-art applications of Stackelberg security games -- including wildlife protection -- offer a wealth of data , which can be used to learn the behavior of the adversary",Background,msa_2579153474
"But existing approaches either make strong assumptions about the structure of the data , or gather new data through online algorithms that are likely to play severely suboptimal strategies",Purpose,msa_2579153474
We develop a new approach,Mechanism,msa_2579153474
to learning the parameters of the behavioral model of a bounded rational attacker ( thereby pinpointing a near optimal strategy ),Purpose,msa_2579153474
", by observing how the attacker responds to only three defender strategies",Mechanism,msa_2579153474
We also validate our approach,Findings,msa_2579153474
Robust principal component analysis ( PCA ) is one of the most important dimension reduction techniques to handle high-dimensional data with outliers,Background,msa_2579157225
"However , the existing robust PCA presupposes that the mean of the data is zero and incorrectly utilizes the Euclidean distance based optimal mean for robust PCA with l1-norm",Purpose,msa_2579157225
"Some studies consider this issue and integrate the estimation of the optimal mean into the dimension reduction objective , which leads to expensive computation",Purpose,msa_2579157225
"In this paper , we equivalently reformulate the maximization of variances for robust PCA , such that the optimal projection directions are learned by maximizing the sum of the projected difference between each pair of instances , rather than the difference between each instance and the mean of the data",Mechanism,msa_2579157225
"Based on this reformulation , we propose a novel robust PCA to automatically avoid the calculation of the optimal mean based on l1-norm distance",Mechanism,msa_2579157225
This strategy also makes the assumption of centered data unnecessary,Mechanism,msa_2579157225
"Additionally , we intuitively extend the proposed robust PCA to its 2D version for image recognition",Mechanism,msa_2579157225
Efficient non-greedy algorithms are exploited to solve the proposed robust PCA and 2D robust PCA with fast convergence and low computational complexity,Mechanism,msa_2579157225

We investigate the problem of representing an entire video using CNN features for human action recognition,Purpose,msa_2580899942
End-to-end learning of CNN/RNNs is currently not possible for whole videos due to GPU memory limitations and so a common practice is to use sampled frames as inputs along with the video labels as supervision,Background,msa_2580899942
"However , the global video labels might not be suitable for all of the temporally local samples as the videos often contain content besides the action of interest",Purpose,msa_2580899942
We therefore propose to instead treat the deep networks trained on local inputs as local feature extractors,Mechanism,msa_2580899942
The local features are then aggregated to form global features which are used to assign video-level labels through a second classification stage,Mechanism,msa_2580899942
We investigate a number of design choices for this local feature approach,Mechanism,msa_2580899942

"Hybrid systems verification is quite important for developing correct controllers for physical systems , but is also challenging",Background,msa_2581290664
"Verification engineers , thus , need to be empowered with ways of guiding hybrid systems verification while receiving as much help from automation as possible",Background,msa_2581290664
"Due to undecidability , verification tools need sufficient means for intervening during the verification and need to allow verification engineers to provide system design insights",Purpose,msa_2581290664
This paper presents the design ideas behind the user interface for the hybrid systems theorem prover KeYmaera X,Mechanism,msa_2581290664
We discuss how they make it easier to prove hybrid systems as well as help learn how to conduct proofs in the first place,Purpose,msa_2581290664
"Unsurprisingly , the most difficult user interface challenges come from the desire to integrate automation and human guidance",Findings,msa_2581290664
"In human-robot teams , humans often start with an inaccurate model of the robot capabilities",Background,msa_2581799494
"As they interact with the robot , they infer the robot 's capabilities and partially adapt to the robot , i",Background,msa_2581799494
", they might change their actions based on the observed outcomes and the robot 's actions , without replicating the robot 's policy",Background,msa_2581799494
We present a game-theoretic model,Mechanism,msa_2581799494
"of human partial adaptation to the robot ,",Purpose,msa_2581799494
"where the human responds to the robot 's actions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time ,",Mechanism,msa_2581799494
capturing the evolution of their expectations of the robot 's capabilities,Purpose,msa_2581799494
The robot can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the information that the human currently has,Mechanism,msa_2581799494
We prove that,Findings,msa_2581799494
"under certain observability assumptions ,",Method,msa_2581799494
the optimal policy can be computed efficiently,Findings,msa_2581799494
We demonstrate through a human subject experiment,Method,msa_2581799494
"that the proposed model significantly improves human-robot team performance ,",Findings,msa_2581799494
Biological systems are increasingly being studied by high throughput profiling of molecular data over time,Background,msa_2581837924
Determining the set of time points to sample in studies that profile several different types of molecular data is still challenging,Purpose,msa_2581837924
Here we present the Time Point Selection ( TPS ) method,Mechanism,msa_2581837924
that solves this combinatorial problem,Purpose,msa_2581837924
in a principled and practical way,Mechanism,msa_2581837924
TPS utilizes expression data from a small set of genes sampled at a high rate,Mechanism,msa_2581837924
"As we show by applying TPS to study mouse lung development ,",Method,msa_2581837924
the points selected by TPS can be used to reconstruct an accurate representation for the expression values of the non selected points,Findings,msa_2581837924
"Further , even though the selection is only based on gene expression , these points are also appropriate for representing a much larger set of protein , miRNA and DNA methylation changes over time",Mechanism,msa_2581837924
Identifying a masked suspect is one of the toughest challenges in biometrics that exist,Background,msa_2582449424
This is an important problem faced in many law-enforcement applications on almost a daily basis,Background,msa_2582449424
"In such situations , investigators often only have access to the periocular region of a suspect 's face and , unfortunately , conventional commercial matchers are unable to process these images in such a way that the suspect can be identified",Purpose,msa_2582449424
"Herein , a practical method",Mechanism,msa_2582449424
to hallucinate a full frontal face given only a periocular region of a face,Purpose,msa_2582449424
Complex event detection has been progressively researched in recent years for the broad interest of video indexing and retrieval,Background,msa_2582553469
"To fulfill the purpose of event detection , one needs to train a classifier using both positive and negative examples",Background,msa_2582553469
Current classifier training treats the negative videos as equally negative,Background,msa_2582553469
"However , we notice that many negative videos resemble the positive videos in different degrees",Purpose,msa_2582553469
"Intuitively , we may capture more informative cues from the negative videos if we assign them fine-grained labels , thus benefiting the classifier learning",Purpose,msa_2582553469
"Aiming for this ,",Purpose,msa_2582553469
we use a statistical method on both the positive and negative examples to get the decisive attributes of a specific event,Mechanism,msa_2582553469
"Based on these decisive attributes , we assign the fine-grained labels to negative examples to treat them differently for more effective exploitation",Mechanism,msa_2582553469
The resulting fine-grained labels may be not optimal to capture the discriminative cues from the negative videos,Mechanism,msa_2582553469
"Hence , we propose to jointly optimize the fine-grained labels with the classifier learning , which brings mutual reciprocality",Mechanism,msa_2582553469
"Meanwhile , the labels of positive examples are supposed to remain unchanged",Mechanism,msa_2582553469
We thus additionally introduce a constraint for this purpose,Mechanism,msa_2582553469
"On the other hand , the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network features are leveraged in our approach for event detection to further boost the performance",Mechanism,msa_2582553469

"Generalized canonical correlation analysis ( GCCA ) aims at extracting common structure from multiple 'views ' , i",Background,msa_2583191533
", high-dimensional matrices representing the same objects in different feature domains an extension of classical two-view CCA",Background,msa_2583191533
"Existing ( G ) CCA algorithms have serious scalability issues , since they involve square root factorization of the correlation matrices of the views",Purpose,msa_2583191533
"The memory and computational complexity associated with this step grow as a quadratic and cubic function of the problem dimension ( the number of samples / features ) , respectively",Purpose,msa_2583191533
"To circumvent such difficulties ,",Purpose,msa_2583191533
"we propose a GCCA algorithm whose memory and computational costs scale linearly in the problem dimension and the number of nonzero data elements , respectively",Mechanism,msa_2583191533
"Consequently , the proposed algorithm can easily handle very large sparse views whose sample and feature dimensions both exceed 100,000 while the current approaches can only handle thousands of features / samples",Mechanism,msa_2583191533
"Our second contribution is a distributed algorithm for GCCA , which computes the canonical components of different views in parallel and thus can",Mechanism,msa_2583191533
further reduce the runtime significantly ( by 30 %,Findings,msa_2583191533

Display appropriation provides a means by which mobile users can cyber-forage local display hardware to provide them with access to a high-quality output device,Background,msa_2583283942
"However , displays are of little use without applications to drive them and yet the nature of application support has been largely ignored in the field with the prevailing assumption being that applications will be cloud-based and Web-centric",Purpose,msa_2583283942
In this demonstration we show a system that presents an alternative vision in which users are able to cyber-forage for both display and compute resources in their local area enabling them,Mechanism,msa_2583283942

"In social voting Web sites , how do the user actions up-votes , down-votes and comments evolve over time ? Are there relationships between votes and comments ? What is normal and what is suspicious ? These are the questions we focus on",Purpose,msa_2583952803
"We analyzed over 20,000 submissions corresponding to more than 100 million user interactions from three social voting Web sites : Reddit , Imgur and Digg",Method,msa_2583952803
Our first contribution is two discoveries : ( i ) the number of comments grows as a power-law on the number of votes and ( ii ) the time between a submission creation and a user 's reaction obeys a log-logistic distribution,Findings,msa_2583952803
"Based on these patterns , we propose VnC ( Vote-and-Comment ) , a parsimonious but accurate and scalable model",Mechanism,msa_2583952803

"Given a heterogeneous network , with nodes of different types - e",Background,msa_2584187726
", products , users and sellers from an online recommendation site like Amazon - and labels for a few nodes ( 'honest ' , 'suspicious ' , etc ) , can we find a closed formula for Belief Propagation ( BP ) , exact or approximate ? Can we say whether it will converge ?",Background,msa_2584187726
"BP , traditionally an inference algorithm for graphical models , exploits so-called `` network effects '' to perform graph classification tasks when labels for a subset of nodes are provided ; and it has been successful in numerous settings like fraudulent entity detection in online retailers and classification in social networks",Purpose,msa_2584187726
"However , it does not have a closed-form nor does it provide convergence guarantees in general",Purpose,msa_2584187726
"We propose ZooBP , a method",Mechanism,msa_2584187726
to perform fast BP on undirected heterogeneous graphs,Purpose,msa_2584187726
with provable convergence guarantees,Mechanism,msa_2584187726
"ZooBP has the following advantages : ( 1 ) Generality : It works on heterogeneous graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges ; ( 2 ) Closed-form solution : ZooBP gives a closed-form solution as well as convergence guarantees ; ( 3 ) Scalability : ZooBP is linear on the graph size and is up to 600 faster than BP , running on graphs with 3",Mechanism,msa_2584187726

Many theories have emerged which investigate how in- variance is generated in hierarchical networks through sim- ple schemes such as max and mean pooling,Background,msa_2584769872
The restriction to max/mean pooling in theoretical and empirical studies has diverted attention away from a more general way of generating invariance to nuisance transformations,Background,msa_2584769872
We con- jecture that hierarchically building selective invariance ( i,Purpose,msa_2584769872
e,Purpose,msa_2584769872
carefully choosing the range of the transformation to be in- variant to at each layer of a hierarchical network ) is im- portant for pattern recognition,Purpose,msa_2584769872
We utilize a novel pooling layer called adaptive pooling,Mechanism,msa_2584769872
to find linear pooling weights within networks,Purpose,msa_2584769872
These networks with the learnt pooling weights have performances on object categorization tasks that are comparable to max/mean pooling networks,Mechanism,msa_2584769872
"In- terestingly , adaptive pooling can converge to mean pooling ( when initialized with random pooling weights ) , find more general linear pooling schemes or even decide not to pool at all",Mechanism,msa_2584769872
How do the k-core structures of real-world graphs look like ? What are the common patterns and the anomalies ? How can we use them for algorithm design and applications ?,Purpose,msa_2584910459
A k-core is the maximal subgraph where all vertices have degree at least k,Background,msa_2584910459
"This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis , graph visualization , and graph clustering",Background,msa_2584910459
"Here , we explore pervasive patterns that are related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from several diverse domains",Purpose,msa_2584910459
Our discoveries are as follows : ( 1 ) Mirror Pattern : coreness of vertices ( i,Findings,msa_2584910459
", maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core ) is strongly correlated to their degree",Findings,msa_2584910459
( 2 ) Core-Triangle Pattern : degeneracy of a graph ( i,Findings,msa_2584910459
", maximum k such that the k-core exists in the graph ) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles",Findings,msa_2584910459
( 3 ) Structured Core Pattern : degeneracy-cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core-periphery and communities,Findings,msa_2584910459

"Given a set of attributed subgraphs known to be from different classes , how can we discover their differences ?",Purpose,msa_2585125256
There are many cases where collections of subgraphs may be contrasted against each other,Background,msa_2585125256
"For example , they may be as- signed ground truth labels ( spam/not-spam ) , or it may be desired to directly compare the biological networks of different species or compound networks of different chemicals",Background,msa_2585125256
In this work we introduce the problem of characterizing the differences between attributed subgraphs that belong to different classes,Purpose,msa_2585125256
"We define this characterization problem as one of partitioning the attributes into as many groups as the number of classes , while maximizing the total attributed quality score of all the given subgraphs",Mechanism,msa_2585125256
We show that our attribute-to-class assignment problem is NP-hard and an optimal ( 1 -- 1/e ) -approximation algorithm exists,Mechanism,msa_2585125256
We also propose two different faster heuristics that are linear-time in the number of attributes and subgraphs,Mechanism,msa_2585125256
"Unlike previous work where only attributes were taken into account for characterization , here we exploit both attributes and social ties ( i",Mechanism,msa_2585125256

The ubiquity of mobile devices and cloud services has led to an unprecedented growth of online personal photo and video collections,Background,msa_2585370664
"Due to the scarcity of personal media search log data , research to date has mainly focused on searching images and videos on the web",Background,msa_2585370664
"However , in order to manage the exploding amount of personal photos and videos , we raise a fundamental question : what are the differences and similarities when users search their own photos versus the photos on the web ?",Purpose,msa_2585370664
"To the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first",Background,msa_2585370664
to study personal media search,Purpose,msa_2585370664
using large-scale real-world search logs,Method,msa_2585370664
We analyze different types of search sessions mined from Flickr search logs and discover a number of interesting characteristics of personal media search in terms of information needs and click behaviors,Method,msa_2585370664
"The insightful observations will not only be instrumental in guiding future personal media search methods , but also benefit related tasks such as personal photo browsing and recommendation",Background,msa_2585370664
"Our findings suggest there is a significant gap between personal queries and automatically detected concepts , which is responsible for the low accuracy of many personal media search queries",Findings,msa_2585370664
"To bridge the gap ,",Purpose,msa_2585370664
we propose the deep query understanding model to learn a mapping from the personal queries to the concepts in the clicked photos,Mechanism,msa_2585370664

"With the ubiquitous development of mobile technologies , many cities today have installed mobile-enabled bike sharing systems - both publicly and privately owned - in an effort to nudge dwellers towards a more sustainable mode of transportation",Background,msa_2585656250
"However , there is little evidence - apart from anecdote stories - for the success of these systems",Background,msa_2585656250
In this work we are focusing on analyzing the impact of a shared bike system on the parking demand,Purpose,msa_2585656250
The latter can be thought of as a lower bound for the car trips generated towards a specific area and has implications towards potential substitution effects between driving and biking,Method,msa_2585656250
"In particular , we use data from Healthy Ride , the newly installed shared bike system in the city of Pittsburgh , combined with data we obtained from the Pittsburgh Parking Authority ,",Method,msa_2585656250
and using the difference-in-differences framework,Mechanism,msa_2585656250
we quantify the impact of the bike stations on the parking demand around them,Purpose,msa_2585656250
Our findings provide evidence that even when controlling for the lost parking space ( used to build the parking stations ) the parking demand in the nearby areas was reduced by approximately 2 %,Findings,msa_2585656250
"This can have significant implications that shared bike systems can shift transportation modes , which consequently can have rippling effects for the economy and environment",Background,msa_2585656250
Multi-aspect data appear frequently in many web-related applications,Background,msa_2585713683
"For example , product reviews are quadruplets of ( user , product , keyword , timestamp )",Background,msa_2585713683
"How can we analyze such web-scale multi-aspect data ? Can we analyze them on an off-the-shelf workstation with limited amount of memory ? Tucker decomposition has been widely used for discovering patterns in relationships among entities in multi-aspect data , naturally expressed as high-order tensors",Background,msa_2585713683
"However , existing algorithms for Tucker decomposition have limited scalability , and especially , fail to decompose high-order tensors since they explicitly materialize intermediate data , whose size rapidly grows as the order increases ( 4 )",Purpose,msa_2585713683
We call this problem M-Bottleneck ( `` Materialization Bottleneck '' ),Purpose,msa_2585713683
"To avoid M-Bottleneck ,",Purpose,msa_2585713683
"we propose S-HOT , a scalable high-order tucker decomposition method that employs the on-the-fly computation",Mechanism,msa_2585713683
to minimize the materialized intermediate data,Purpose,msa_2585713683
"Moreover , S-HOT is designed for handling disk-resident tensors , too large to fit in memory , without loading them all in memory at once",Mechanism,msa_2585713683
We provide theoretical analysis on the amount of memory space and the number of scans of data required by S-HOT,Method,msa_2585713683
"In our experiments ,",Method,msa_2585713683
How can we detect fraudulent lockstep behavior in large-scale multi-aspect data ( i,Background,msa_2586047314
", tensors ) ? Can we detect it when data are too large to fit in memory or even on a disk ? Past studies have shown that dense blocks in real-world tensors ( e",Background,msa_2586047314
", social media , Wikipedia , TCP dumps , etc",Background,msa_2586047314
") signal anomalous or fraudulent behavior such as retweet boosting , bot activities , and network attacks",Background,msa_2586047314
"Thus , various approaches , including tensor decomposition and search , have been used for rapid and accurate dense-block detection in tensors",Background,msa_2586047314
"However , all such methods have low accuracy , or assume that tensors are small enough to fit in main memory , which is not true in many real-world applications such as social media and web",Purpose,msa_2586047314
"To overcome these limitations ,",Purpose,msa_2586047314
"we propose D-Cube , a disk-based dense-block detection method , which also can be run in a distributed manner across multiple machines",Mechanism,msa_2586047314
"Compared with state-of-the-art methods ,",Method,msa_2586047314
We study the unsupervised learning of CNNs for optical flow estimation using proxy ground truth data,Purpose,msa_2586135505
"Supervised CNNs , due to their immense learning capacity , have shown superior performance on a range of computer vision problems including optical flow prediction",Background,msa_2586135505
They however require the ground truth flow which is usually not accessible except on limited synthetic data,Purpose,msa_2586135505
"Without the guidance of ground truth optical flow , unsupervised CNNs often perform worse as they are naturally ill-conditioned",Purpose,msa_2586135505
We therefore propose a novel framework in which proxy ground truth data generated from classical approaches is used,Mechanism,msa_2586135505
to guide the CNN learning,Purpose,msa_2586135505
The models are further refined in an unsupervised fashion using an image reconstruction loss,Mechanism,msa_2586135505
Our guided learning approach is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches,Findings,msa_2586135505

We show,Findings,msa_2587183101
"that , for exponentially distributed setup times",Method,msa_2587183101
", the response time of an M/G/k/staggered-setup approximately decomposes into the sum of the response time for an M/G/k and the setup time , where the approximation is nearly exact",Findings,msa_2587183101
This paper studies the resilient distributed estimation of an unknown vector parameter belonging to a compact set,Purpose,msa_2587789688
A group of agents makes linear measurements of the unknown parameter,Background,msa_2587789688
"The agent measurements are locally unobservable , and the agents exchange information over a communication network in order to compute an estimate",Background,msa_2587789688
"A subset of the agents is adversarial and exchanges false information in order to prevent the remaining , normally-behaving agents from correctly estimating the parameter",Background,msa_2587789688

The FRDE algorithm is a consensus+innovations type estimator in which agents combine estimates of neighboring agents ( consensus ) with local sensing information ( innovations ),Mechanism,msa_2587789688
"Under the FRDE algorithm , global observability for connected normally-behaving agents is a necessary and sufficient condition to either correctly estimate the parameter or correctly detect the presence of an adversary",Mechanism,msa_2587789688

"To infer the histories of population admixture , one important challenge with methods based on the admixture linkage disequilibrium ( ALD ) is to get rid of the effect of source LD ( SLD ) which is directly inherited from source populations",Background,msa_2588904085
"In previous methods , only the decay curve of weighted LD between pairs of sites whose genetic distance were larger than a certain starting distance was fitted by single or multiple exponential functions , for the inference of recent single- or multiple-wave of admixture",Background,msa_2588904085

"Sparse iterative methods , in particular first-order methods , are known to be among the most effective in solving large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games",Background,msa_2589557409
The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on,Background,msa_2589557409
We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods,Mechanism,msa_2589557409

through better design of the dilated entropy function -- -a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games,Mechanism,msa_2589557409

"Motivated by the need to extract meaning from large amounts of complex structured data , we consider three critical problems on graphs : localization , decomposition , and dictionary learning of piecewise-constant signals",Purpose,msa_2590066967
"These graph-based problems are related to many real-world applications , such as localizing stimulus in brain connectivity networks , and mining traffic events in city street networks , where the key issue is to find the supports of localized activated patterns",Background,msa_2590066967
"Counterparts of these problems in classical signal/image processing , such as impulse detection and foreground detection , have been studied over the past few decades",Background,msa_2590066967
We use piecewise-constant graph signals,Mechanism,msa_2590066967
"to model localized patterns ,",Purpose,msa_2590066967
where each piece indicates a localized pattern that exhibits homogeneous internal behavior and the number of pieces indicates the number of localized patterns,Mechanism,msa_2590066967
"For such signals , we show that decomposition and dictionary learning are natural extensions of localization , the goal of which is not only to efficiently approximate graph signals , but also to accurately find supports of localized patterns",Mechanism,msa_2590066967

"Video semantic recognition usually suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the absence of enough high-quality labeled instances , thus semisupervised feature selection gains increasing attentions for its efficiency and comprehensibility",Background,msa_2590822257
Most of the previous methods assume that videos with close distance ( neighbors ) have similar labels and characterize the intrinsic local structure through a predetermined graph of both labeled and unlabeled data,Background,msa_2590822257
"However , besides the parameter tuning problem underlying the construction of the graph , the affinity measurement in the original feature space usually suffers from the curse of dimensionality",Purpose,msa_2590822257
"Additionally , the predetermined graph separates itself from the procedure of feature selection , which might lead to downgraded performance for video semantic recognition",Purpose,msa_2590822257
"In this paper , we exploit a novel semisupervised feature selection method from a new perspective",Mechanism,msa_2590822257
The primary assumption underlying our model is that the instances with similar labels should have a larger probability of being neighbors,Mechanism,msa_2590822257
"Instead of using a predetermined similarity graph , we incorporate the exploration of the local structure into the procedure of joint feature selection so as to learn the optimal graph simultaneously",Mechanism,msa_2590822257
"Moreover , an adaptive loss function is exploited to measure the label fitness , which significantly enhances model 's robustness to videos with a small or substantial loss",Mechanism,msa_2590822257

"However , high degree of structural complexity together with practical imaging limitations make the systematic de novo discovery of structures within cells challenging",Background,msa_2591330651
It would likely require averaging and classifying millions of subtomograms potentially containing hundreds of highly heterogeneous structural classes,Background,msa_2591330651
"Although it is no longer difficult to acquire CECT data containing such amount of subtomograms due to advances in data acquisition automation , existing computational approaches have very limited scalability or discrimination ability , making them incapable of processing such amount of data",Purpose,msa_2591330651

Abstract The heterogeneity-gap between different modalities brings a significant challenge to multimedia information retrieval,Background,msa_2594785588
Some studies formalize the cross-modal retrieval tasks as a ranking problem and learn a shared multi-modal embedding space to measure the cross-modality similarity,Background,msa_2594785588
"However , previous methods often establish the shared embedding space based on linear mapping functions which might not be sophisticated enough to reveal more complicated inter-modal correspondences",Purpose,msa_2594785588
"Additionally , current studies assume that the rankings are of equal importance , and thus all rankings are used simultaneously , or a small number of rankings are selected randomly to train the embedding space at each iteration",Purpose,msa_2594785588
"Such strategies , however , always suffer from outliers as well as reduced generalization capability due to their lack of insightful understanding of procedure of human cognition",Purpose,msa_2594785588

to rank and learn an optimal multi-modal embedding space based on non-linear mapping functions,Purpose,msa_2594785588
This strategy enhances the models robustness to outliers and achieves better generalization via training the model gradually from easy rankings by diverse queries to more complex ones,Mechanism,msa_2594785588

"Existing methods often ignore global context cues capturing the interactions among different object instances , and can only recognize a handful of types by exhaustively training individual detectors for all possible relationships",Purpose,msa_2595373712
"To capture such global interdependency ,",Purpose,msa_2595373712
we propose a deep Variation-structured Reinforcement Learning ( VRL ) framework to sequentially discover object relationships and attributes in the whole image,Mechanism,msa_2595373712

Our proposed system contains several components to solve different problems regarding RBCs and WBCs,Mechanism,msa_2595946440
We first design a novel blood cell color representation which is able to emphasize the RBCs and WBCs in separate channels,Mechanism,msa_2595946440
Template matching technique is then employed to individually detect RBCs and WBCs in our proposed representation,Mechanism,msa_2595946440
"In order to automatically segment the RBCs and nuclei from WBCs , we develop an adaptive level set-based segmentation method which makes use of both local and global information",Mechanism,msa_2595946440
"The detected and segmented RBCs , however , can be a single RBC , a connected RBC or an abnormal RBC",Mechanism,msa_2595946440

"As smartphones and tablets have been widely adopted and mobile banking apps have come into ubiquitous use , mobile devices have increasingly become new tools that customers use for banking , payments , budgeting , and shopping",Background,msa_2596649803
"This paper examines the impact of the mobile channel on customer service demand across banking digital channels , and investigates how the use of the mobile channel influences customer financial decision-making",Purpose,msa_2596649803
Our analysis is validated,Method,msa_2596649803
"based on a novel large-scale dataset that contains 43 million individual transactions from 190,000 customers during April to June 2013 from a financial institution in the United States",Mechanism,msa_2596649803
"Our findings suggest that : ( 1 ) the use of the mobile channel increases customer demand for digital services ; ( 2 ) lower ATM density and higher branch channel density in the customers vicinity is associated with higher digital service demand ; ( 3 ) the mobile phone channel serves as a complement to the PC channel , the tablet channel substitutes for the PC channel , and the mobile phone channel and the tablet channel complement one another ; ( 4 ) customers acquire more information for financial decision-making following the use of the mobile channel , and mobile phone and tablet users are less likely to incur overdraft and credit card penalty fees",Findings,msa_2596649803

"Intelligent conversational assistants , such as Apple 's Siri , Microsoft 's Cortana , and Amazon 's Echo , have quickly become a part of our digital life",Background,msa_2598764358
"However , these assistants have major limitations , which prevents users from conversing with them as they would with human dialog partners",Purpose,msa_2598764358
This limits our ability to observe how users really want to interact with the underlying system,Purpose,msa_2598764358
To address this problem,Purpose,msa_2598764358
", we developed a crowd-powered conversational assistant , Chorus , and deployed it to see how users and workers would interact together when mediated by the system",Mechanism,msa_2598764358
"Chorus sophisticatedly converses with end users over time by recruiting workers on demand , which in turn decide what might be the best response for each user sentence",Mechanism,msa_2598764358
"Up to the first month of our deployment , 59 users have held conversations with Chorus during 320 conversational sessions",Findings,msa_2598764358
"In this paper , we present an account of Chorus ' deployment , with a focus on four challenges : ( i ) identifying when conversations are over , ( ii ) malicious users and workers , ( iii ) on-demand recruiting , and ( iv ) settings in which consensus is not enough",Purpose,msa_2598764358
Voting systems typically treat all voters equally,Background,msa_2599299280
We argue that perhaps they should not : Voters who have supported good choices in the past should be given higher weight than voters who have supported bad ones,Purpose,msa_2599299280
"To develop a formal framework for desirable weighting schemes ,",Purpose,msa_2599299280
we draw on no-regret learning,Mechanism,msa_2599299280
"Specifically , given a voting rule , we wish to design a weighting scheme such that applying the voting rule , with voters weighted by the scheme , leads to choices that are almost as good as those endorsed by the best voter in hindsight",Mechanism,msa_2599299280
"Understanding traffic density from large-scale web camera ( webcam ) videos is a challenging problem because such videos have low spatial and temporal resolution , high occlusion and large perspective",Background,msa_2600230189
"To deeply understand traffic density ,",Purpose,msa_2600230189
we explore both deep learning based and optimization based methods,Mechanism,msa_2600230189
"To avoid individual vehicle detection and tracking ,",Purpose,msa_2600230189
"both methods map the image into vehicle density map , one based on rank constrained regression and the other one based on fully convolution networks ( FCN )",Mechanism,msa_2600230189
The regression based method learns different weights for different blocks in the image to increase freedom degrees of weights and embed perspective information,Mechanism,msa_2600230189
"The FCN based method jointly estimates vehicle density map and vehicle count with a residual learning framework to perform end-to-end dense prediction , allowing arbitrary image resolution , and adapting to different vehicle scales and perspectives",Mechanism,msa_2600230189
"We analyze and compare both methods ,",Method,msa_2600230189
and get insights from optimization based method to improve deep model,Findings,msa_2600230189
"Since existing datasets do not cover all the challenges in our work , we collected and labelled a large-scale traffic video dataset , containing 60 million frames from 212 webcams",Method,msa_2600230189
Both methods are extensively evaluated and compared on different counting tasks and datasets,Method,msa_2600230189
"In this paper , we present reasoning techniques",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
for a component-based modeling and verification approach for hybrid systems,Purpose,msa_2600438659
"comprising discrete dynamics as well as continuous dynamics , in which the components have local responsibilities",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
Our approach supports component contracts i,Mechanism,msa_2600438659
", input assumptions and output guarantees of interfaces that are more general than previous component-based hybrid systems verification techniques in the following ways : We introduce change contracts , which characterize how current values exchanged between components along ports relate to previous values",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
"We also introduce delay contracts , which describe the change relative to the time that has passed since the last value was exchanged",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
"Together , these contracts can take into account what has changed between two components in a given amount of time since the last exchange of information",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
"Most crucially , we prove that the safety of compatible components implies safety of the composite",Mechanism,msa_2600438659
Processes such as disease propagation and information diffusion often spread over some latent network structure that must be learned from observation,Background,msa_2601121662
"Given a set of unlabeled training examples representing occurrences of an event type of interest ( such as a disease outbreak ) , the authors aim to learn a graph structure that can be used to accurately detect future events of that type",Purpose,msa_2601121662
They propose a novel framework,Mechanism,msa_2601121662
for learning graph structure from unlabeled data,Purpose,msa_2601121662
by comparing the most anomalous subsets detected with and without the graph constraints,Mechanism,msa_2601121662
"Their framework uses the mean normalized log-likelihood ratio score to measure the quality of a graph structure , and it efficiently searches for the highest-scoring graph structure",Mechanism,msa_2601121662
"Using simulated disease outbreaks injected into real-world Emergency Department data from Allegheny County ,",Method,msa_2601121662
We introduce the first goal-driven training,Mechanism,msa_2603266952
for visual question answering and dialog agents,Purpose,msa_2603266952
"Specifically , we pose a cooperative 'image guessing ' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images",Mechanism,msa_2603266952
We use deep reinforcement learning ( RL ) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward,Mechanism,msa_2603266952
We demonstrate two experimental results,Method,msa_2603266952
"First , as a 'sanity check ' demonstration of pure RL ( from scratch ) ,",Method,msa_2603266952
"we show results on a synthetic world , where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabulary , i",Findings,msa_2603266952
", symbols with no pre-specified meanings ( X , Y , Z )",Findings,msa_2603266952
We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes ( shape/color/style ),Findings,msa_2603266952
"Thus , we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among 'visual ' dialog agents with no human supervision",Findings,msa_2603266952
"Second , we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset , where we pretrain with supervised dialog data",Method,msa_2603266952
"Chest X-ray ( CXR ) is one of the most commonly prescribed medical imaging procedures , often with over 2-10x more scans than other imaging modalities such as MRI , CT scan , and PET scans",Background,msa_2603901205
These voluminous CXR scans place significant workloads on radiologists and medical practitioners,Background,msa_2603901205
Organ segmentation is a crucial step to obtain effective computer-aided detection on CXR,Purpose,msa_2603901205
"In this work , we propose Structure Correcting Adversarial Network ( SCAN )",Mechanism,msa_2603901205
to segment lung fields and the heart in CXR images,Purpose,msa_2603901205
SCAN incorporates a critic network to impose on the convolutional segmentation network the structural regularities emerging from human physiology,Mechanism,msa_2603901205
"During training , the critic network learns to discriminate between the ground truth organ annotations from the masks synthesized by the segmentation network",Mechanism,msa_2603901205
Through this adversarial process the critic network learns the higher order structures and guides the segmentation model to achieve realistic segmentation outcomes,Mechanism,msa_2603901205
Extensive experiments,Method,msa_2603901205
show that our method produces highly accurate and natural segmentation,Findings,msa_2603901205
"Using only very limited training data available ,",Method,msa_2603901205
our model reaches human-level performance without relying on any existing trained model or dataset,Findings,msa_2603901205

Modeling the long-term facial aging process is extremely challenging due to the presence of large and non-linear variations during the face development stages,Background,msa_2604117447
In order to efficiently address the problem,Purpose,msa_2604117447
", this work first decomposes the aging process into multiple short-term stages",Mechanism,msa_2604117447
"Then , a novel generative probabilistic model , named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving ( TNVP ) transformation , is presented",Mechanism,msa_2604117447
to model the facial aging process at each stage,Purpose,msa_2604117447
"Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks ( GANs ) , which requires an empirical balance threshold , and Restricted Boltzmann Machines ( RBM ) , an intractable model , our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function , exact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations between faces in consecutive stages",Mechanism,msa_2604117447
Our model shows its advantages not only in capturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing a smooth synthesis in age progression across faces,Mechanism,msa_2604117447
Our approach can model any face in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points,Mechanism,msa_2604117447
"Moreover , the structure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping the advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density estimation",Mechanism,msa_2604117447
"Our method is evaluated in both terms of synthesizing age-progressed faces and cross-age face verification and consistently shows the state-of-the-art results in various face aging databases , i",Method,msa_2604117447

Analyzing videos of human actions involves understanding the temporal relationships among video frames,Background,msa_2604128149
CNNs are the current state-of-the-art methods for action recognition in videos,Background,msa_2604128149
"However , the CNN architectures currently being used have difficulty in capturing these relationships",Purpose,msa_2604128149
State-of-the-art action recognition approaches rely on traditional local optical flow estimation methods to pre-compute the motion information for CNNs,Purpose,msa_2604128149
"Such a two-stage approach is computationally expensive , storage demanding , and not end-to-end trainable",Purpose,msa_2604128149
"In this paper , we present a novel CNN architecture that implicitly captures motion information",Mechanism,msa_2604128149
"Our method is 10x faster than a two-stage approach , does not need to cache flow information , and is end-to-end trainable",Mechanism,msa_2604128149

We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network ( DCNN ) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object,Mechanism,msa_2604796864
to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience,Purpose,msa_2604796864
"The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints , to modify the view-manifold of object representations",Mechanism,msa_2604796864
"It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects , resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories",Mechanism,msa_2604796864
"This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category , independent of viewpoints",Mechanism,msa_2604796864
"We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects , but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories , as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects",Mechanism,msa_2604796864
"This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract , likely at the levels of parts , and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training",Background,msa_2604796864
"Interestingly , the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet ,",Findings,msa_2604796864
"Given a collection of seasonal time-series , how can we find regular ( cyclic ) patterns and outliers ( i",Background,msa_2604906612

"How can we robustly separate regular patterns and outliers , without requiring any prior information ?",Purpose,msa_2604906612
"We present CycloneM , a unifying model",Mechanism,msa_2604906612
"to capture both cyclic patterns and outliers ,",Purpose,msa_2604906612
"and CycloneFact , a novel algorithm",Mechanism,msa_2604906612
which solves the above problem,Purpose,msa_2604906612
"We also present an automatic mining framework AutoCyclone , based on CycloneM and CycloneFact",Mechanism,msa_2604906612
"Our method has the following properties ; ( a ) effective : it captures important cyclic features such as trend and seasonality , and distinguishes regular patterns and rare events clearly ; ( b ) robust and accurate : it detects the above features and patterns accurately against outliers ; ( c ) fast : CycloneFact takes linear time in the data size and typically converges in a few iterations ; ( d ) parameter free : our modeling framework frees the user from having to provide parameter values",Mechanism,msa_2604906612
Extensive experiments on 4 real datasets,Method,msa_2604906612
The recently developed variational autoencoders ( VAEs ) have proved to be an effective confluence of the rich representational power of neural networks with Bayesian methods,Background,msa_2604977777
"However , most work on VAEs use a rather simple prior over the latent variables such as standard normal distribution , thereby restricting its applications to relatively simple phenomena",Purpose,msa_2604977777
"In this work , we propose hierarchical nonparametric variational autoencoders , which combines tree-structured Bayesian nonparametric priors with VAEs ,",Mechanism,msa_2604977777
to enable infinite flexibility of the latent representation space,Purpose,msa_2604977777
Both the neural parameters and Bayesian priors are learned jointly using tailored variational inference,Mechanism,msa_2604977777
"The resulting model induces a hierarchical structure of latent semantic concepts underlying the data corpus , and infers accurate representations of data instances",Mechanism,msa_2604977777

Many problems in image processing and computer vision ( e,Background,msa_2605028456
g,Background,msa_2605028456
"colorization , style transfer ) can be posed as 'manipulating ' an input image into a corresponding output image given a user-specified guiding signal",Background,msa_2605028456
"A holy-grail solution towards generic image manipulation should be able to efficiently alter an input image with any personalized signals ( even signals unseen during training ) , such as diverse paintings and arbitrary descriptive attributes",Background,msa_2605028456
"However , existing methods are either inefficient to simultaneously process multiple signals ( let alone generalize to unseen signals ) , or unable to handle signals from other modalities",Purpose,msa_2605028456
"In this paper , we make the first attempt to address the zero-shot image manipulation task",Purpose,msa_2605028456
We cast this problem as manipulating an input image according to a parametric model whose key parameters can be conditionally generated from any guiding signal ( even unseen ones ),Mechanism,msa_2605028456
"To this end , we propose the Zero-shot Manipulation Net ( ZM-Net ) , a fully-differentiable architecture that jointly optimizes an image-transformation network ( TNet ) and a parameter network ( PNet )",Mechanism,msa_2605028456
The PNet learns to generate key transformation parameters for the TNet given any guiding signal while the TNet performs fast zero-shot image manipulation according to both signal-dependent parameters from the PNet and signal-invariant parameters from the TNet itself,Mechanism,msa_2605028456
Extensive experiments,Method,msa_2605028456
show that our ZM-Net can perform high-quality image manipulation conditioned on different forms of guiding signals ( e,Findings,msa_2605028456
g,Findings,msa_2605028456
style images and attributes ) in real-time ( tens of milliseconds per image ) even for unseen signals,Findings,msa_2605028456
"Moreover , a large-scale style dataset with over 20,000 style images is also constructed",Mechanism,msa_2605028456
"Reading , tracing , and explaining the behavior of code are strongly correlated with the ability to write code effectively",Background,msa_2605352040
"To investigate program understanding in young children ,",Purpose,msa_2605352040
we introduced two groups of third graders to Microsoft 's Kodu Game Lab ; the second group was also given four semantic `` Laws of Kodu '' to better scaffold their reasoning and discourage some common misconceptions,Method,msa_2605352040
Explicitly teaching semantics proved helpful with one type of misconception but not with others,Findings,msa_2605352040
"During each session , students were asked to predict the behavior of short Kodu programs",Method,msa_2605352040
We found different styles of student reasoning ( analytical and analogical ) that may correspond to distinct neo-Piagetian stages of development as described by Teague and Lister ( 2014 ),Findings,msa_2605352040
"We analyze how alternative consumer data handling regimes affect the welfare of consumers , advertising firms , and an intermediary Ad exchange in the context of targeted advertising",Purpose,msa_2605539038
"We find that the collection and use of consumer data for targeting purposes affect consumer welfare through three distinct , and possibly countervailing , effects : match improvement , offer discrimination , and supply expansion",Findings,msa_2605539038
"Furthermore , we find that the economic interests of the three agents can be misaligned , depending on the degree of heterogeneity in consumer preferences",Findings,msa_2605539038
"Finally , we find that a strategic intermediary may choose to share with advertising firms only a subset of consumer data , maximizing its profits at their cost",Findings,msa_2605539038
In situations where the intermediary has an incentive to reveal the information that maximizes its payoff,Method,msa_2605539038
"When tasked to find fraudulent social network users , what is a practitioner to do ?",Background,msa_2606085668
Traditional classification can lead to poor generalization and high misclassification given few and possibly biased labels,Purpose,msa_2606085668
We tackle this problem,Purpose,msa_2606085668
"by analyzing fraudulent behavioral patterns , featurizing users to yield strong discriminative performance ,",Method,msa_2606085668
and building algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2606085668
to handle new and multimodal fraud types,Purpose,msa_2606085668
"First , we set up honeypots , or `` dummy '' social network accounts on which we solicit fake followers ( after careful IRB approval )",Mechanism,msa_2606085668
"We report the signs of such behaviors , including oddities in local network connectivity , account attributes , and similarities and differences across fraud providers",Findings,msa_2606085668
"We discover several types of fraud behaviors , with the possibility of even more",Findings,msa_2606085668
"We discuss how to leverage these insights in practice , build strongly performing entropy-based features , and propose OEC ( Open-ended Classification ) , an approach for `` future-proofing '' existing algorithms to account for the complexities of link fraud",Mechanism,msa_2606085668
Our contributions are,Mechanism,msa_2606085668

Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) have enabled countless new applications in the domain of aerial sensing,Background,msa_2606189012
"In scenarios such as intrusion detection , target tracking and facility monitoring it is important to reach a given area of interest ( AOI ) , and create an online data streaming connection to a monitoring ground station ( GS ) for immediate delivery of content to the operator",Background,msa_2606189012
"In previous work , we showed that a multi-hop line network can increase the range of the mission by finding the optimal number of relay UAVs , and their optimal placement",Background,msa_2606189012
"In this demo , we show that CSMA ( typical 802",Purpose,msa_2606189012
"11 's medium access protocol ) behaves poorly in this type of networks due to mutual interference , and that TDMA is a better alternative",Purpose,msa_2606189012
Most cameras are equipped with an auto-contrast feature that enables them to take high quality pictures in a wide range of lighting conditions,Background,msa_2606400834
"Auto-contrast works by increasing the sensitivity of the camera to light in dimly lit surroundings , but reducing it in bright conditions to ensure that images do not become saturated",Background,msa_2606400834
Our visual system is equipped with a similar feature,Background,msa_2606400834
Neurons in the visual system increase or decrease their sensitivity to light as appropriate to enable us to see in both dimly lit rooms and dazzling sunshine,Background,msa_2606400834
"This process , which is known as dynamic range adaptation , also occurs in neurons that are sensitive to sound or touch",Background,msa_2606400834
Rasmussen et al,Purpose,msa_2606400834
therefore wondered whether the same might hold true for neurons that encode non-sensory stimuli such as the direction of movement,Purpose,msa_2606400834
"Would these neurons change their sensitivity to direction if presented with a wide range of possible directions instead of a narrow range ? If so , this would suggest that dynamic range adaptation occurs throughout the nervous system",Purpose,msa_2606400834
"To find out ,",Purpose,msa_2606400834
Rasmussen et al,Method,msa_2606400834
trained two rhesus macaque monkeys to use their brain activity to move a cursor on a virtual reality screen in either 2D or 3D,Method,msa_2606400834
Studying this brain activity,Method,msa_2606400834
showed that neurons became less sensitive to the cursors direction of movement when the task switched from 2D to 3D,Findings,msa_2606400834
"This makes sense because in a 3D task , which also features depth , the neurons have a greater range of possible movement directions to encode",Background,msa_2606400834
"Conversely , the neurons became more sensitive to the direction of movement when the task switched from 3D to 2D",Findings,msa_2606400834
Under these circumstances the neurons can use activity that was previously dedicated to encoding depth to instead represent the 2D space in finer detail,Findings,msa_2606400834
"With ever growing data volume and model size , an error-tolerant , communication efficient , yet versatile distributed algorithm has become vital for the success of many large-scale machine learning applications",Purpose,msa_2606474801
"In this work we propose m-PAPG , an implementation of the flexible proximal gradient algorithm in model parallel systems equipped with the partially asynchronous communication protocol",Mechanism,msa_2606474801
The worker machines communicate asynchronously with a controlled staleness bound $ s $ and operate at different frequencies,Mechanism,msa_2606474801
We characterize various convergence properties of m-PAPG :,Mechanism,msa_2606474801
"1 ) Under a general non-smooth and non-convex setting ,",Method,msa_2606474801
we prove that every limit point of the sequence generated by m-PAPG is a critical point of the objective function,Findings,msa_2606474801
"; 2 ) Under an error bound condition ,",Method,msa_2606474801
we prove that the function value decays linearly for every $ s $ steps ;,Findings,msa_2606474801

Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing rapidly and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation,Background,msa_2606555570
One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles using sensor-based perception and inter-vehicle communications,Background,msa_2606555570
"When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same spatial area simultaneously , they might collide with one another , might become deadlocked , or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle",Background,msa_2606555570
"In this paper , we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points , where two lanes with different priorities meet",Purpose,msa_2606555570
"We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points , where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems",Mechanism,msa_2606555570

"Intelligent personalization systems are becoming increasingly reliant on contextually-relevant devices and services , such as those available within modern IoT deployments",Background,msa_2607086097
An IoT context may emerge -- -or become pervasive -- -when the intelligent system generates knowledge from dialogue-based interactions with the end-user ; the context is strengthened even further by incorporating state representations about the environment ( e,Background,msa_2607086097
", generated from wireless sensor data ) into the knowledge graph",Background,msa_2607086097
"This is crucial for pervasive applications like digital assistance in IoT , where context-aware systems need to adapt quickly : activities like leaving work home-bound , driving to the grocery store , arriving at home , and walking the dog , for example , can occur in a relatively short period of time -- - during which an intelligent assistant must be able to support user requests in a consistent and coherent manner",Background,msa_2607086097
"Given that computational ontologies can serve as semantic models for heterogeneous data , they are becoming increasingly viable for reasoning across different IoT contexts",Background,msa_2607086097
"This involves : ( a ) federation and dynamic pruning of multiple modular ontologies , ideally , to comprehensively capture only the knowledge that will facilitate execution of a multi-context task ; ( b ) fast consistency-checking and ontology-based inferences , aided by rules-based execution environments that can evaluate/transform ambient wireless sensor network ( WSN ) data , in real-time ; and ( c ) run-time execution of ontology-based control procedures , through rule-engine actuation commands sent across the WSN",Background,msa_2607086097
"Only by realizing these functionalities may intelligent systems be capable of reasoning over device properties , system states , and user activities , while appropriately delegating commands to other intelligent agents or other relevant IoT services",Background,msa_2607086097
"In this poster , we illustrate how a multi-context knowledge base can be structured on the basis of modular ontologies and integrated with a distributed rules-based inference engine in multiple smart-building environments ,",Mechanism,msa_2607086097

Traditional generative adversarial networks ( GAN ) and many of its variants are trained by minimizing the KL or JS-divergence loss that measures how close the generated data distribution is from the true data distribution,Background,msa_2607491080
"A recent advance called the WGAN based on Wasserstein distance can improve on the KL and JS-divergence based GANs , and alleviate the gradient vanishing , instability , and mode collapse issues that are common in the GAN training",Background,msa_2607491080
"In this work , we aim at improving on the WGAN",Purpose,msa_2607491080
"by first generalizing its discriminator loss to a margin-based one , which leads to a better discriminator , and in turn a better generator , and then carrying out a progressive training paradigm involving multiple GANs to contribute to the maximum margin ranking loss so that the GAN at later stages will improve upon early stages",Mechanism,msa_2607491080
We call this method Gang of GANs ( GoGAN ),Mechanism,msa_2607491080
We have shown theoretically,Method,msa_2607491080
that the proposed GoGAN can reduce the gap between the true data distribution and the generated data distribution by at least half in an optimally trained WGAN,Findings,msa_2607491080
We have also proposed a new way of measuring GAN quality which is based on image completion tasks,Mechanism,msa_2607491080
"We have evaluated our method on four visual datasets : CelebA , LSUN Bedroom , CIFAR-10 , and 50K-SSFF ,",Method,msa_2607491080
"The problems of hand detection have been widely addressed in many areas , e",Background,msa_2608527876
g,Background,msa_2608527876
"human computer interaction environment , driver behaviors monitoring , etc",Background,msa_2608527876
"However , the detection accuracy in recent hand detection systems are still far away from the demands in practice due to a number of challenges , e",Purpose,msa_2608527876
g,Purpose,msa_2608527876
"hand variations , highly occlusions , low-resolution and strong lighting conditions",Purpose,msa_2608527876
This paper presents the Multiple Scale Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network ( MS-FRCNN ),Mechanism,msa_2608527876
to handle the problems of hand detection in given digital images collected under challenging conditions,Purpose,msa_2608527876
Our proposed method introduces a multiple scale deep feature extraction approach in order to handle the challenging factors to provide a robust hand detection algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2608527876
"The method is evaluated on the challenging hand database , i",Method,msa_2608527876

"the Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications ( VIVA ) Challenge , and compared against various recent hand detection methods",Method,msa_2608527876
"While only recently developed , the ability to profile expression data in single cells ( scRNA-Seq ) has already led to several important studies and findings",Background,msa_2609173726
"However , this technology has also raised several new computational challenges including questions related to handling the noisy and sometimes incomplete data , how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments and how to determine the state or function of specific cells based on their expression profile",Purpose,msa_2609173726
To address these issues,Purpose,msa_2609173726
we develop and test a method based on neural networks ( NN ),Mechanism,msa_2609173726
for the analysis and retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data,Purpose,msa_2609173726
"We tested various NN architectures , some biologically motivated , and used these to obtain a reduced dimension representation of the single cell expression data",Mechanism,msa_2609173726
"We show that the NN method improves upon prior methods in both , the ability to correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles",Findings,msa_2609173726
High Assurance SPIRAL ( HA-SPIRAL ) is a tool that,Mechanism,msa_2609223029
synthesizes a faithful and high performance implementation from the mathematical specification of a given controller or monitor,Purpose,msa_2609223029
At the heart of HA-SPIRAL is a mathematical identity rewrite engine based on a computer algebra system,Mechanism,msa_2609223029
"The rewrite engine refines the mathematical expression provided by a control engineer , through mathematical identities , into an equivalent mathematical expression that can be implemented in code",Mechanism,msa_2609223029
The recent explosion in the adoption of search engines and new media such as blogs and Twitter have facilitated the faster propagation of news and rumors,Background,msa_2609338674
How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media ? How does its popularity diminish over time ? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law ?,Purpose,msa_2609338674
"In this article , we propose S pike M , a concise yet flexible analytical model of",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion,Purpose,msa_2609338674
Our model has the following advantages,Mechanism,msa_2609338674
"First , unification power : it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
We provide the threshold of the take-off versus die-out conditions for S pike M and discuss the generality of our model by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology,Mechanism,msa_2609338674
"Second , practicality : it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
"Third , parsimony : it requires only a handful of parameters",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
"Fourth , usefulness : it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting , spotting anomalies , and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest ( quality of news , number of interested bloggers , etc",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
),Mechanism,msa_2609338674
We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm,Mechanism,msa_2609338674
"for the real-time monitoring of information diffusion ,",Purpose,msa_2609338674
"namely S pike S tream , which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams",Mechanism,msa_2609338674
Extensive experiments on real datasets,Method,msa_2609338674
"In face recognition tasks , the changing pose of the face can cause enough information to be lost to cause the recognition to fail so being able to determine the pose of the face beforehand can allow for some better recognition performance",Background,msa_2609641019
Many methods used for pose estimation tasks rely on finding some underlying structure of the data given to create a classifier,Purpose,msa_2609641019
We propose,Mechanism,msa_2609641019
an alternative,Purpose,msa_2609641019
method in which the training data itself is the underlying structure of a classifier,Mechanism,msa_2609641019
This is accomplished through the use of matrix decomposition equations,Mechanism,msa_2609641019
"However , instead of decomposing a matrix , one is created by carefully selecting the terms in the decomposition equation such that the resulting matrix has the desired properties for classification",Mechanism,msa_2609641019
We show two recomposition methods using the Spectral Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition equations,Mechanism,msa_2609641019
We show this method can perform pose estimation with a high accuracy of 85,Findings,msa_2609641019
21 % and an accuracy of 98,Findings,msa_2609641019
42 % when allowing a 15 tolerance on the pose estimate on the CUbiC FacePix dataset,Findings,msa_2609641019
We also show results on both yaw and pitch estimation on the Pointing'04 dataset,Method,msa_2609641019
We study the design of pricing mechanisms and auctions when the mechanism designer does not know the distribution of buyers ' values,Purpose,msa_2610284463
Instead the mechanism designer receives a set of samples from this distribution and his goal is to use the sample to design a pricing mechanism or auction with high expected profit,Method,msa_2610284463
We provide generalization guarantees which bound the difference between average profit on the sample and expected profit over the distribution,Method,msa_2610284463
These bounds are directly proportional to the intrinsic complexity of the mechanism class the designer is optimizing over,Method,msa_2610284463
"We present a single , overarching theorem that uses empirical Rademacher complexity",Mechanism,msa_2610284463
to measure the intrinsic complexity of a variety of widely-studied single- and multi-item auction classes,Purpose,msa_2610284463
", including affine maximizer auctions , mixed-bundling auctions , and second-price item auctions",Mechanism,msa_2610284463
"Despite the extensive applicability of our main theorem , we match and improve over the best-known generalization guarantees for many auction classes",Mechanism,msa_2610284463
"This all-encompassing theorem also applies to multi- and single-item pricing mechanisms in both multi- and single-unit settings , such as linear and non-linear pricing mechanisms",Mechanism,msa_2610284463
"Finally , our central theorem allows us to easily derive generalization guarantees for every class in several finely grained hierarchies of auction and pricing mechanism classes",Mechanism,msa_2610284463
We demonstrate how to determine the precise level in a hierarchy with the optimal tradeoff between profit and generalization using structural profit maximization,Purpose,msa_2610284463
Rapid improvements in the precision of mobile technologies make it possible for advertisers to go beyond using the real-time static location and contextual information about consumers,Background,msa_2610291238
"In this study , we propose a novel trajectory-based targeting strategy",Mechanism,msa_2610291238
for mobile recommendation,Purpose,msa_2610291238
that leverages full information on consumers physical movement trajectories using granular behavioral information from different mobility dimensions,Mechanism,msa_2610291238
"To analyze the effectiveness of this new strategy , we design a large-scale randomized field experiment in a large shopping mall that involved 83,370 unique user responses for a 14-day period in June 2014",Method,msa_2610291238
"We find that trajectory-based mobile targeting can lead to higher redemption probability , faster redemption behavior , and higher transaction amount from customers compared to other baselines",Findings,msa_2610291238
It also facilitates higher revenues for the focal store as well as the overall shopping mall,Findings,msa_2610291238
"Moreover , the effect of trajectory-based targeting comes not only from improvements in the efficiency of customers current shopping process , but also from its ability to nudge customers towards changing their future shopping patterns and generate additional revenues",Findings,msa_2610291238
"Finally , we find significant heterogeneity in the impact of trajectory-based targeting",Findings,msa_2610291238
It is especially effective in influencing high-income consumers,Findings,msa_2610291238
"Interestingly , it becomes less effective in boosting the revenues of the shopping mall during the weekends and for those shoppers who like to explore across products categories",Findings,msa_2610291238
"Common appliances have shifted toward flat interface panels , making them inaccessible to blind people",Background,msa_2610299746
"Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers , doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the original functions and apply the labels",Background,msa_2610299746
We introduce Facade - a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline,Mechanism,msa_2610299746
to help blind people independently make physical interfaces accessible,Purpose,msa_2610299746
by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel,Mechanism,msa_2610299746
Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker ( a dollar bill ) for recovering size information,Mechanism,msa_2610299746
"This image is sent to multiple crowd workers , who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface",Mechanism,msa_2610299746
Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls,Mechanism,msa_2610299746
"Finally , a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer , which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person",Mechanism,msa_2610299746
We demonstrate the viability of Facade,Findings,msa_2610299746

Is it possible to monitor the entire traffic in Manhattan at a few intersections ?,Purpose,msa_2610517164
"This paper proposes a series of sampling , recovery and representation techniques based on graph signal processing",Mechanism,msa_2610517164
"to handle complex , nonsmooth graph signals",Purpose,msa_2610517164
We validate our proposed techniques on Manhattan 's taxi pickups during the years of 2014 and 2015,Method,msa_2610517164
We are able to approximately recover the taxi-pick activities in Manhattan by sampling at only 5 selected intersections,Findings,msa_2610517164
"Implicit discourse relation classification is of great challenge due to the lack of connectives as strong linguistic cues , which motivates the use of annotated implicit connectives to improve the recognition",Purpose,msa_2610536450
"We propose a feature imitation framework in which an implicit relation network is driven to learn from another neural network with access to connectives , and thus encouraged",Mechanism,msa_2610536450
to extract similarly salient features for accurate classification,Purpose,msa_2610536450
We develop an adversarial model,Mechanism,msa_2610536450

"Hearing-impaired people and non-native speakers rely on captions for access to video content ,",Background,msa_2610606473

"In this paper , we present the design , implementation and evaluation of BandCaption , a system that combines automatic speech recognition with input from crowd workers",Mechanism,msa_2610606473
to provide a cost-efficient captioning solution for accessible online videos,Purpose,msa_2610606473
"We consider four stakeholder groups as our source of crowd workers : ( i ) individuals with hearing impairments , ( ii ) second-language speakers with low proficiency , ( iii ) second-language speakers with high proficiency , and ( iv ) native speakers",Method,msa_2610606473
"Each group has different abilities and incentives , which our workflow leverages",Mechanism,msa_2610606473
Our findings show that BandCaption enables crowd workers who have different needs and strengths to accomplish micro-tasks and make complementary contributions,Findings,msa_2610606473
The promise of smart environments and the Internet of Things ( IoT ) relies on robust sensing of diverse environmental facets,Background,msa_2610623618
"Traditional approaches rely on direct and distributed sensing , most often by measuring one particular aspect of an environment with a special purpose sensor",Purpose,msa_2610623618
"This approach can be costly to deploy , hard to maintain , and aesthetically and socially obtrusive",Purpose,msa_2610623618
"In this work , we explore the notion of general purpose sensing , wherein a single enhanced sensor can indirectly monitor a large context , without direct instrumentation of objects",Purpose,msa_2610623618
"Further , through what we call Synthetic Sensors , we can virtualize raw sensor data into actionable feeds , whilst simultaneously mitigating immediate privacy issues",Mechanism,msa_2610623618
"A series of structured , formative studies informed the development of our new sensor hardware and accompanying information architecture",Method,msa_2610623618
"We deployed our system across many months and environments ,",Method,msa_2610623618
Objective,Purpose,msa_2610624362
"We present the multidimensional tensor scan ( MDTS ) , a new method",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
for identifying emerging patterns in multidimensional spatio-temporal data,Purpose,msa_2610624362
", and demonstrate the utility of this approach for discovering emerging geographic , demographic , and behavioral trends in fatal drug overdoses",Findings,msa_2610624362
Introduction Drug overdoses are an increasingly serious problem in the United States and worldwide,Background,msa_2610624362
"The CDC estimates that 47,055 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in 2014 , 61 % of which involved opioids ( including heroin , pain relievers such as oxycodone , and synthetics )",Background,msa_2610624362
1 Overdose deaths involving opioids increased 3-fold from 2000 to 2014,Background,msa_2610624362
"1 These statistics motivate public health to identify emerging trends in overdoses , including geographic , demographic , and behavioral patterns ( e",Background,msa_2610624362
", which combinations of drugs are involved )",Background,msa_2610624362
"Early detection can inform prevention and response efforts , as well as quantifying the effects of drug legislation and other policy changes",Background,msa_2610624362
"The fast subset scan 2 detects significant spatial patterns of disease by efficiently maximizing a log-likelihood ratio statistic over subsets of data points , and has recently been extended to multidimensional data ( MD-Scan )",Background,msa_2610624362
"3 While MD-Scan is a potentially useful tool for drug overdose surveillance , the high dimensionality and sparsity of the data requires a new approach to estimate and represent baselines ( expected counts ) , maintaining both accuracy and efficient computation when searching over subsets",Purpose,msa_2610624362
Methods The multidimensional tensor scan ( MDTS ) is a new approach,Mechanism,msa_2610624362
to subset scanning in multidimensional data,Purpose,msa_2610624362
"In addition to detecting the spatial area ( subset of locations ) and time window affected by an emerging outbreak , MDTS can also identify the affected subset of values for each observed attribute",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
"For example , given the drug overdose surveillance data described below , MDTS can identify the affected genders , races , age ranges , and which drugs were involved",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
"MDTS finds subsets of the attribute space with higher than expected case counts , first using a novel tensor decomposition approach to estimate the expected counts",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
"MDTS then iteratively applies a conditional optimization step , optimizing over all subsets of values for each attribute conditional on the current subsets of values for all other attributes 3 , and using the linear-time subset scanning property 2 to make each conditional optimization step computationally efficient",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
The resulting approach has high power to detect and characterize emerging trends which may only affect a subset of the monitored population ( e,Mechanism,msa_2610624362
", specific ages , genders , neighborhoods , or users of particular combinations of drugs )",Mechanism,msa_2610624362
Results,Findings,msa_2610624362
"We used MDTS to analyze publicly available data from the Allegheny County , PA medical examiners office and to detect emerging overdose patterns and trends",Method,msa_2610624362
The dataset consists of ~2000 fatal accidental drug overdoses between 2008 and 2015,Method,msa_2610624362
"For each overdose victim , we have date , location ( zip code ) , age decile , gender , race , and the presence/absence of 27 commonly abused drugs in their system",Method,msa_2610624362
The highest-scoring clusters discovered by MDTS were shared with Allegheny Countys Dept,Findings,msa_2610624362
of Human Services and their feedback obtained,Findings,msa_2610624362
"One set of potentially relevant findings from our analysis involved fentanyl , a dangerous and potent opioid which has been a serious problem in western PA",Findings,msa_2610624362
"In addition to identifying two well- known , large clusters of overdoses14 deaths in January 2014 and 26 deaths in March-April 2015MDTS was able to provide additional information about each cluster",Findings,msa_2610624362
"For example , the first cluster was likely due to fentanyl-laced heroin , while the second was more likely due to fentanyl disguised as heroin ( only 11 victims had heroin in their system )",Findings,msa_2610624362
"Moreover , the second cluster was initially confined to the Pittsburgh suburb of McKeesport and a typical demographic ( white males ages 20-49 ) , before spreading across the county",Findings,msa_2610624362
"Our analysis demonstrated that prospective surveillance using MDTS would have identified the cluster as early as March 29th , enabling targeted prevention efforts",Findings,msa_2610624362
"MDTS also discovered a previously unidentified , highly localized cluster of fentanyl-related overdoses affecting an unusual and underserved demographic ( elderly black males near downtown Pittsburgh )",Findings,msa_2610624362
"This cluster occurred in January- February 2015 , and may have been related to the larger cluster of fentanyl-related overdoses that occurred two months later",Findings,msa_2610624362
"Finally , we identified multiple overdose clusters involving combinations of methadone and Xanax between 2008 and 2012 , and observed dramatic reductions in these clusters corresponding to the passage of the Methadone Death and Incident Review Act ( October 2012 ) , which increased state oversight of methadone clinics and prescribing physicians",Findings,msa_2610624362
"Homes , offices and many other environments will be increasingly saturated with connected , computational appliances , forming the `` Internet of Things '' ( IoT )",Background,msa_2610935612
"At present , most of these devices rely on mechanical inputs , webpages , or smartphone apps for control",Background,msa_2610935612
"However , as IoT devices proliferate , these existing interaction methods will become increasingly cumbersome",Purpose,msa_2610935612
Will future smart-home owners have to scroll though pages of apps to select and dim their lights ?,Purpose,msa_2610935612
We propose an approach where users simply tap a smartphone to an appliance,Mechanism,msa_2610935612
to discover and rapidly utilize contextual functionality,Purpose,msa_2610935612
"To achieve this , our prototype smartphone recognizes physical contact with uninstrumented appliances , and summons appliance-specific interfaces",Mechanism,msa_2610935612
Our user study,Method,msa_2610935612
suggests high accuracy 98,Findings,msa_2610935612
8 % recognition accuracy among 17 appliances,Findings,msa_2610935612
"Small , local groups who share protected resources ( e",Background,msa_2611140034
", families , work teams , student organizations ) have unmet authentication needs",Background,msa_2611140034
"For these groups , existing authentication strategies either create unnecessary social divisions ( e",Purpose,msa_2611140034
", biometrics ) , do not identify individuals ( e",Purpose,msa_2611140034
", shared passwords ) , do not equitably distribute security responsibility ( e",Purpose,msa_2611140034
", individual passwords ) , or make it difficult to share or revoke access ( e",Purpose,msa_2611140034
", physical keys )",Purpose,msa_2611140034
"To explore an alternative ,",Purpose,msa_2611140034
we designed Thumprint : inclusive group authentication with a shared secret knock,Mechanism,msa_2611140034
"All group members share one secret knock , but individual expressions of the secret are discernible",Mechanism,msa_2611140034
We evaluated the usability and security of our concept through two user studies with 30 participants,Method,msa_2611140034
Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices,Background,msa_2611258330
The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day,Background,msa_2611258330
"New low-power , sub-GHz , long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices",Background,msa_2611258330
"These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking ( LPWAN ) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks ( WiFi , Cellular , etc )",Background,msa_2611258330
"In this paper , we present OpenChirp , a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network ( LoRaWAN )",Mechanism,msa_2611258330
with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things ( IoT ) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities,Purpose,msa_2611258330
We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer,Mechanism,msa_2611258330
"allowing users to register devices , describe transducer properties , transfer data and retrieve historical values",Purpose,msa_2611258330
We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer,Mechanism,msa_2611258330
to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams,Purpose,msa_2611258330
"At the device-level , we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy ( BLE )",Mechanism,msa_2611258330
to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers,Purpose,msa_2611258330
We relate the time-limiting behavior of a network epidemics process to the spectral radius of the underlying network,Mechanism,msa_2611281853
"The process we study is the scaled SIS network process , a continuous-time Markov process on a static network",Purpose,msa_2611281853
Our analysis differs from previous work in that the scaled SIS process accounts for the possibility that a healthy individual has a nonzero probability of becoming infected even when all of its neighbors are healthy,Mechanism,msa_2611281853
"For example , the source of infection may be outside a human only contact network for diseases with animal to human transmissions such as Ebola",Mechanism,msa_2611281853
"We show that the sufficient condition for infection to become extinct not only depends on the ratio of infection and healing rates but also on N , the size of the network ,",Findings,msa_2611281853
The proliferation of mobile and sensor technologies has contributed to the rise of location-based mobile targeting,Background,msa_2611355462
"Beyond the location , time and spatial context of individuals , the social context wherein they are embedded can reveal rich information about their behavior",Background,msa_2611355462
"Such real-time social dynamics can help mobile advertisers to more fully understand consumer contextual preferences and , thereby , provide better digital experiences",Background,msa_2611355462
"In this study ,",Purpose,msa_2611355462
we automatically detected,Mechanism,msa_2611355462
the real-time social contexts of customers,Purpose,msa_2611355462
based on their detailed GPS trajectories using state-of-the-art machine-learning methods,Mechanism,msa_2611355462
"To evaluate the effectiveness of mobile targeting under different social contexts , we designed a randomized field experiment for a large shopping mall in Asia based on 52,500 unique user responses for 252 stores over the course of a 21-day period in April 2015",Method,msa_2611355462
Our analyses indicated significant heterogeneity in consumer behavior under different real-time social contexts,Findings,msa_2611355462
"We found , for example , that a customer in a group with others is on average 1",Findings,msa_2611355462
"97 times more responsive to mobile promotions than is a solo shopper , and that this impact increases with increased group size ( from dyad to triad )",Findings,msa_2611355462
"Interestingly , we also found that couples seemed to have an attention deficit with respect to mobile promotions and were the least responsive compared with the other social groups",Findings,msa_2611355462
"Meanwhile , high-income customers and male customers were more likely to respond to mobile promotions when shopping alone than when shopping with social groups",Findings,msa_2611355462
Our analyses also revealed significant heterogeneity in the interaction effect between mobile promotion design and real-time social contexts,Findings,msa_2611355462
We apply graph signal processing,Mechanism,msa_2611356371
to the study of taxi movement in New York City,Purpose,msa_2611356371
based on 20102013 New York City taxi data,Mechanism,msa_2611356371
Such analysis requires a signal extraction method that involves computing shortest paths between the start and end locations for each of the 700 million trip records,Mechanism,msa_2611356371
"We perform spectral analysis on these graph signals , for which it is necessary to address the challenge of finding the eigendecomposition of the 6K-node directed Manhattan road network",Method,msa_2611356371
"Current touch input technologies are best suited for small and flat applications , such as smartphones , tablets and kiosks",Background,msa_2611427051
"In general , they are too expensive to scale to large surfaces , such as walls and furniture , and can not provide input on objects having irregular and complex geometries , such as tools and toys",Purpose,msa_2611427051
"We introduce Electrick , a low-cost and versatile sensing technique",Mechanism,msa_2611427051
"that enables touch input on a wide variety of objects and surfaces , whether small or large , flat or irregular",Purpose,msa_2611427051
"This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material , which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces",Mechanism,msa_2611427051
"We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods , such as spray/brush coating , vacuum forming , and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs",Mechanism,msa_2611427051
"Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects , including those that are laser cut or 3D printed",Mechanism,msa_2611427051
"Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses ,",Method,msa_2611427051
"Blind people often need to identify objects around them , from packages of food to items of clothing",Background,msa_2611577320
"Automatic object recognition continues to provide limited assistance in such tasks because models tend to be trained on images taken by sighted people with different background clutter , scale , viewpoints , occlusion , and image quality than in photos taken by blind users",Background,msa_2611577320
"We explore personal object recognizers , where visually impaired people train a mobile application with a few snapshots of objects of interest and provide custom labels",Purpose,msa_2611577320
We adopt transfer learning with a deep learning system for user-defined multi-label k-instance classification,Mechanism,msa_2611577320
Experiments with blind participants,Method,msa_2611577320
"demonstrate the feasibility of our approach , which reaches accuracies over 90 % for some participants",Findings,msa_2611577320
"Current tools for screening dyslexia use linguistic elements , since most dyslexia manifestations are related to difficulties in reading and writing",Background,msa_2612029394
"These tools can only be used with children that have already acquired some reading skills and ; sometimes , this detection comes too late to apply proper remediation",Purpose,msa_2612029394
"In this paper , we propose a method and present DysMusic , a prototype",Mechanism,msa_2612029394
which aims to predict risk of having dyslexia before acquiring reading skills,Purpose,msa_2612029394
The prototype was designed with the help of five children and five parents who tested the game using the think aloud protocol and being observed while playing,Method,msa_2612029394
"While a number of schemes exist for mixed-criticality scheduling in a single processor setting , no solution exists to cover the industry need for end-to-end scheduling across multiple processors in a pipeline",Purpose,msa_2612077275
"In this paper , we present an end-to-end zero-slack rate-monotonic scheme ( ZSRM ) based on real-time pipelines , called the ZSRM pipeline scheduler ,",Mechanism,msa_2612077275
that addresses this need,Purpose,msa_2612077275
"Under ZSRM , each task is associated with a parameter called zero-slack instant , and whenever a higher-criticality job has not finished at its zero-slack instant relative to its arrival time , all jobs of lower criticality are suspended to meet the deadline of the higher-criticality job",Mechanism,msa_2612077275

"Information cascades are ubiquitous in both physical society and online social media , taking on large variations in structures , dynamics and semantics",Background,msa_2612538457
"Although there has been much progress on understanding the dynamics and semantics of information cascades , little is known about their structural patterns",Purpose,msa_2612538457
"In this paper , we explore a large-scale dataset including 432 million information cascades with explicit records of spreading traces",Mechanism,msa_2612538457
We find that the structural complexity of information cascades is far beyond the previous conjectures,Findings,msa_2612538457
"We first propose seven-dimensional metrics , which reflect size and spreading orientation aspects ,",Mechanism,msa_2612538457
to quantify the structural characteristics of millions of information cascades,Purpose,msa_2612538457
"Further , we analyze the correlations of these metrics ,",Method,msa_2612538457

"This paper continues the program initiated in [ 5 ] ,",Background,msa_2613141079
towards a derivation system,Mechanism,msa_2613141079
for security protocols,Purpose,msa_2613141079
"The general idea is that complex protocols can be formally derived , starting from basic security components , using a sequence of refinements and transformations , just like logical proofs are derived starting from axioms , using proof rules and transformations",Mechanism,msa_2613141079
"The claim is that in practice , many protocols are already derived in such a way , but informally",Mechanism,msa_2613141079
Capturing this practice in a suitable formalism turns out to be a considerable task,Mechanism,msa_2613141079
The present paper proposes rules,Mechanism,msa_2613141079
for composing security protocols from given security components,Purpose,msa_2613141079
"In general , security protocols are , of course , not compositional : information revealed by one may interfere with the security of the other",Mechanism,msa_2613141079
"However , annotating protocol steps by pre- and post-conditions , allows secure sequential composition",Mechanism,msa_2613141079
"Establishing that protocol components satisfy each other 's invariants allows more general forms of composition , ensuring that the individually secure sub-protocols will not interact insecurely in the composite protocol",Mechanism,msa_2613141079
The applicability of the method is demonstrated,Findings,msa_2613141079

Feature extraction and encoding represent two of the most crucial steps in an action recognition system,Background,msa_2613856667
For building a powerful action recognition pipeline it is important that both steps are efficient and in the same time provide reliable performance,Purpose,msa_2613856667
This work proposes a new approach,Mechanism,msa_2613856667
for feature extraction and encoding,Purpose,msa_2613856667
that allows us to obtain real-time frame rate processing for an action recognition system,Mechanism,msa_2613856667
The motion information represents an important source of information within the video,Mechanism,msa_2613856667
The common approach to extract the motion information is to compute the optical flow,Mechanism,msa_2613856667
"However , the estimation of optical flow is very demanding in terms of computational cost , in many cases being the most significant processing step within the overall pipeline of the target video analysis application",Mechanism,msa_2613856667
In this work we propose an efficient approach to capture the motion information within the video,Mechanism,msa_2613856667
"Our proposed descriptor , Histograms of Motion Gradients ( HMG ) , is based on a simple temporal and spatial derivation , which captures the changes between two consecutive frames",Mechanism,msa_2613856667
"For the encoding step a widely adopted method is the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors ( VLAD ) , which is an efficient encoding method , however , it considers only the difference between local descriptors and their centroids",Mechanism,msa_2613856667
"In this work we propose Shape Difference VLAD ( SD-VLAD ) , an encoding method which brings complementary information by using the shape information within the encoding process",Mechanism,msa_2613856667
"We validated our proposed pipeline for action recognition on three challenging datasets UCF50 , UCF101 and HMDB51",Method,msa_2613856667
"As online fraudsters invest more resources , including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs , fraudulent attacks become less obvious and their detection becomes increasingly challenging",Background,msa_2613993493
"Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary , resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification",Purpose,msa_2613993493
"Hence , we propose HoloScope , which uses information from graph topology and temporal spikes",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
to more accurately detect groups of fraudulent users,Purpose,msa_2613993493
"In terms of graph topology , we introduce `` contrast suspiciousness , '' a dynamic weighting approach , which allows us to more accurately detect fraudulent blocks , particularly low-density blocks",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
"In terms of temporal spikes , HoloScope takes into account the sudden bursts and drops of fraudsters ' attacking patterns",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
"In addition , we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
"Additionally , from the perspective of ratings , HoloScope incorporates the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
"Moreover , HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity , making the algorithm reproducible and scalable",Mechanism,msa_2613993493
Extensive experiments,Method,msa_2613993493
"In comparison-shopping services ( CSS ) , there exist frauds who perform excessive clicks on a target item in order to boost the popularity of it",Background,msa_2614022477

"As one of the featured initiatives in smart grids , demand response is enabling active participation of electricity consumers in the supply/demand balancing process , thereby enhancing the power systems operational flexibility in a costeffective way",Background,msa_2614529461
"Industrial load plays an important role in demand response because of its intense power consumption , already existing advanced monitoring and control infrastructure , and its strong economic incentive due to the high energy costs",Background,msa_2614529461
"As typical industrial loads , cement plants are able to quickly adjust their power consumption rate by switching on/off the crushers",Background,msa_2614529461
"However , in the cement plant as well as other industrial loads , switching on/off the loading units only achieves discrete power changes , which restricts the load from offering valuable ancillary services such as regulation and load following , as continuous power changes are required for these services",Purpose,msa_2614529461
"In this paper , we overcome this restriction of poor granularity",Purpose,msa_2614529461
Large graph datasets have caused renewed interest for graph partitioning,Background,msa_2616221141
"However , existing well-studied graph partitioners often assume that vertices of the graph are always active during the computation , which may lead to time-varying skewness for traversal-style graph workloads , like Breadth First Search , since they only explore part of the graph in each superstep",Purpose,msa_2616221141
"Additionally , existing solutions do not consider what vertices each partition will have , as a result , high-degree vertices may be concentrated into a few partitions , causing imbalance",Purpose,msa_2616221141
"Towards this , we introduce the idea of skew-resistant graph partitioning , where",Mechanism,msa_2616221141
the objective is to create an initial partitioning that will `` hold well '' over time without suffering from skewness,Purpose,msa_2616221141
This paper presents an approach,Mechanism,msa_2617350882
to formalizing and enforcing a class of use privacy properties in data-driven systems,Purpose,msa_2617350882

"Our definition relates proxy use to intermediate computations that occur in a program , and identify two essential properties that characterize this behavior : 1 ) its result is strongly associated with the protected information type in question , and 2 ) it is likely to causally affect the final output of the program",Mechanism,msa_2617350882
"For a specific instantiation of this definition , we present a program analysis technique that detects instances of proxy use in a model , and provides a witness that identifies which parts of the corresponding program exhibit the behavior",Mechanism,msa_2617350882

Learning video concept detectors automatically from the big but noisy web data with no additional manual annotations is a novel but challenging area in the multimedia and the machine learning community,Background,msa_2617934722
"A considerable amount of videos on the web is associated with rich but noisy contextual information , such as the title and other multi-modal information , which provides weak annotations or labels about the video content",Purpose,msa_2617934722
"To tackle the problem of large-scale noisy learning ,",Purpose,msa_2617934722
"We propose a novel method called Multi-modal WEbly-Labeled Learning ( WELL-MM ) , which is established on the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm inspired by the learning process of human",Mechanism,msa_2617934722
WELL-MM introduces a novel multi-modal approach to incorporate meaningful prior knowledge called curriculum from the noisy web videos,Mechanism,msa_2617934722
We empirically study the curriculum constructed from the multi-modal features of the Internet videos and images,Method,msa_2617934722

Summary Cryo-electron tomography ( cryo-ET ) captures the 3Delectron density distribution of macromolecular complexes in close to native state,Background,msa_2618381588
"With the rapid advance of cryo-ET acquisition technologies , it is possible to generate large numbers ( > 100,000 ) of subtomograms , each containing a macromolecular complex",Background,msa_2618381588
"Often , these subtomograms represent a heterogeneous sample due to variations in the structure and composition of a complex insitu form or because particles are a mixture of different complexes",Background,msa_2618381588
In this case subtomograms must be classified,Background,msa_2618381588
"However , classification of large numbers of subtomograms is a time-intensive task and often a limiting bottleneck",Purpose,msa_2618381588
"This paper introduces an open source software platform , TomoMiner ,",Mechanism,msa_2618381588
"for large-scale subtomogram classification , template matching , subtomogram averaging , and alignment",Purpose,msa_2618381588
The Kinect sensing devices have been widely used in current Human-Computer Interaction entertainment,Background,msa_2619145493
A fundamental issue involved is to detect users motions accurately and quickly,Purpose,msa_2619145493
"In this paper , we tackle it by proposing a linear algorithm , which is augmented by feature interaction",Mechanism,msa_2619145493
The linear property guarantees its speed whereas feature interaction captures the higher order effect from the data to enhance its accuracy,Mechanism,msa_2619145493
The Schatten-p norm is leveraged to integrate the main linear effect and the higher order nonlinear effect by mining the correlation between them,Mechanism,msa_2619145493
The resulted classification model is a desirable combination of speed and accuracy,Mechanism,msa_2619145493
We propose a novel solution to solve our objective function,Mechanism,msa_2619145493
Experiments are performed on three public Kinect-based entertainment data sets related to fitness and gaming,Method,msa_2619145493
"In this paper , we study automatic geo-localization of online event videos",Purpose,msa_2620128686
"Different from general image localization task through matching , the appearance of an environment during significant events varies greatly from its daily appearance , since there are usually crowds , decorations or even destruction when a major event happens",Background,msa_2620128686
"This introduces a major challenge : matching the event environment to the daily environment , e",Purpose,msa_2620128686
g,Purpose,msa_2620128686
as recorded by Google Street View,Purpose,msa_2620128686
"We observe that some regions in the image , as part of the environment , still preserve the daily appearance even though the whole image ( environment ) looks quite different",Purpose,msa_2620128686
"Based on this observation , we formulate the problem as joint saliency estimation and matching at the image region level , as opposed to the key point or whole-image level",Mechanism,msa_2620128686
"As image-level labels of daily environment are easily generated with GPS information , we treat region based saliency estimation and matching as a weakly labeled learning problem over the training data",Mechanism,msa_2620128686
Our solution is to iteratively optimize saliency and the region-matching model,Mechanism,msa_2620128686
"For saliency optimization , we derive a closed form solution , which has an intuitive explanation",Mechanism,msa_2620128686
"For region matching model optimization , we use self-paced learning to learn from the pseudo labels generated by ( sub-optimal ) saliency values",Mechanism,msa_2620128686
We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging public datasets : Boston Marathon 2013 and Tokyo Time Machine,Method,msa_2620128686
Utility maximization under a budget constraint is a classical problem in economics and management science,Background,msa_2621230859
"It is commonly assumed that the utility is a `` nice '' known analytic function , for example , continuous and concave",Background,msa_2621230859
"In many domains , such as marketing , increased availability of computational resources and data has enabled the development of sophisticated simulations to evaluate the impact of allocating a fixed budget among alternatives ( e",Background,msa_2621230859
", marketing channels ) on outcomes , such as demand",Background,msa_2621230859
"While simulations enable high resolution evaluation of alternative budget allocation strategies , they significantly complicate the associated budget optimization problem",Background,msa_2621230859
"In particular , simulation runs are time consuming , significantly limiting the space of options that can be explored",Purpose,msa_2621230859
"An important second challenge is the common presence of budget complementarities , where non-negligible budget increments are required for an appreciable marginal impact from a channel",Purpose,msa_2621230859
This introduces a combinatorial structure on the decision space,Purpose,msa_2621230859
We propose to address these challenges,Purpose,msa_2621230859
by first converting the problem into a multi-choice knapsack optimization problem with unknown weights,Mechanism,msa_2621230859
"We show that if weights ( corresponding to marginal impact thresholds for each channel ) are well approximated , we can achieve a solution within a factor of 2 of optimal , and this bound is tight",Mechanism,msa_2621230859
We then develop several parsimonious query algorithms,Mechanism,msa_2621230859
for achieving this approximation in an online fashion,Purpose,msa_2621230859
Experimental evaluation,Method,msa_2621230859
Deep generative models have achieved impressive success in recent years,Background,msa_2621386477
"Generative Adversarial Networks ( GANs ) and Variational Autoencoders ( VAEs ) , as powerful frameworks for deep generative model learning , have largely been considered as two distinct paradigms and received extensive independent study respectively",Purpose,msa_2621386477
This paper establishes formal connections between deep generative modeling approaches,Purpose,msa_2621386477
through a new formulation of GANs and VAEs,Mechanism,msa_2621386477
"We show that GANs and VAEs are essentially minimizing KL divergences with opposite directions and reversed latent/visible treatments , extending the two learning phases of classic wake-sleep algorithm , respectively",Mechanism,msa_2621386477
"The unified view provides a powerful tool to analyze a diverse set of existing model variants , and enables to exchange ideas across research lines in a principled way",Mechanism,msa_2621386477
"For example , we transfer the importance weighting method in VAE literatures for improved GAN learning , and enhance VAEs with an adversarial mechanism",Mechanism,msa_2621386477
Quantitative experiments,Method,msa_2621386477
"In this paper , we propose a coordinate descent approach",Mechanism,msa_2621393736
to low-rank structured semidefinite programming,Purpose,msa_2621393736
"The approach , which we call the Mixing method , is extremely simple to implement , has no free parameters , and typically attains an order of magnitude or better improvement in optimization performance over the current state of the art",Mechanism,msa_2621393736
"We show that for certain problems , the method is strictly decreasing and guaranteed to converge to a critical point",Findings,msa_2621393736
"We then apply the algorithm to three separate domains : solving the maximum cut semidefinite relaxation , solving a ( novel ) maximum satisfiability relaxation , and solving the GloVe word embedding optimization problem",Method,msa_2621393736
"In all settings , we demonstrate improvement over the existing state of the art along various dimensions",Findings,msa_2621393736

"In this paper , we address the challenge of recovering a time sequence of counts from aggregated historical data",Purpose,msa_2623244766
"For example , given a mixture of the monthly and weekly sums , how can we find the daily counts of people infected with flu ? In general , what is the best way to recover historical counts from aggregated , possibly overlapping historical reports , in the presence of missing values ? Equally importantly , how much should we trust this reconstruction ?",Purpose,msa_2623244766
"We propose H-FUSE , a novel method that solves above problems by allowing injection of domain knowl- edge in a principled way , and turning the task into a well- defined optimization problem",Mechanism,msa_2623244766

"Occupancy estimation is an important primitive for a wide range of applications including building energy efficiency , safety , and security",Background,msa_2623546828
"In this paper , we explore the potential of using depth sensors to detect , estimate , identify , and track occupants in buildings",Purpose,msa_2623546828
"While depth sensors have been widely used for human detection and gesture recognition , computer vision algorithms are typically run on a powerful computer like XBOX or Intel R CoreTM i7 processor",Purpose,msa_2623546828
"In this work , we develop a prototype system called FORK using off-the-shelf components that performs the entire depth data processing on a cheaper and low power ARM processor in real-time",Mechanism,msa_2623546828
"As ARM processors are extremely weak in running computer vision algorithms , FORK is designed to detect humans and track them in a very efficient way by leveraging a novel lightweight model based approach instead of traditional approaches based on histogram of oriented gradients ( HOG ) features",Mechanism,msa_2623546828
"Unlike other camera based approaches , FORK is much less privacy invasive ( even if the sensor is compromised )",Mechanism,msa_2623546828
"Based on a complete implementation , real-world deployment , and extensive evaluation at realistic scenarios ,",Method,msa_2623546828

that selectively blurs faces according to specified policies at full frame rates,Mechanism,msa_2623587395
This enables privacy management for live video analytics while providing a secure approach for handling retrospective policy exceptions,Mechanism,msa_2623587395
"Finally , we present a scalable , privacy-aware architecture",Mechanism,msa_2623587395
"As video cameras proliferate , the ability to scalably capture and search their data becomes important",Background,msa_2623867348
"Scalability is improved by performing video analytics on cloudlets at the edge of the Internet , and only shipping extracted index information and meta-data to the cloud",Purpose,msa_2623867348

"Due to the advent of active safety features and automated driving capabilities , the complexity of embedded computing systems within automobiles continues to increase",Background,msa_2624213075
Such advanced driver assistance systems ( ADAS ) are inherently safetycritical and must tolerate failures in any subsystem,Background,msa_2624213075
"However , fault-tolerance in safety-critical systems has been traditionally supported by hardware replication , which is prohibitively expensive in terms of cost , weight , and size for the automotive market",Purpose,msa_2624213075
Recent work has studied the use of software-based faulttolerance techniques that utilize task-level hot and cold standbys to tolerate fail-stop processor and task failures,Background,msa_2624213075
The benefit of using standbys is maximal when a task and any of its standbys obey the placement constraint of not being co-located on the same processor,Background,msa_2624213075
We propose,Mechanism,msa_2624213075

"In this paper , we introduce Pulsar , a wireless time transfer platform",Mechanism,msa_2624437692
that can achieve clock synchronization,Purpose,msa_2624437692
to better than five nanosecond between indoor or GPS-denied devices,Mechanism,msa_2624437692
Nanosecond-level clock synchronization is a missing capability for many real-time applications like next-generation wireless systems that leverage spatial multiplexing to improve channel capacity and provide services like time-of-flight localization,Background,msa_2624437692
"With finegrained synchronization , both clock stability and propagation delays introduce significant sources of error",Background,msa_2624437692
Pulsar leverages a stable clock source derived from a Chip-Scale Atomic Clock ( CSAC ) along with an Ultra-WideBand ( UWB ) radio able to perform sub-nanosecond packet timestamping to estimate and correct for clock offsets,Mechanism,msa_2624437692
We design and evaluate a proof-ofconcept network-wide synchronization protocol for Pulsar that selects low-jitter links to both estimate the location of nodes and reduce cumulative synchronization error across multiple hops,Mechanism,msa_2624437692
The Pulsar platform and protocol together provide a phase synchronized one pulse per second ( 1PPS ) signal and 10 MHz reference clock that can be easily integrated with typical enduser applications like software-defined radios and communication systems,Mechanism,msa_2624437692
"We experimentally evaluate the Pulsar platform in terms of clock synchronization accuracy , Allan deviation between pairwise clocks and ranging accuracy",Method,msa_2624437692
"Despite their growing prominence , optimization in generative adversarial networks ( GANs ) is still a poorly-understood topic",Purpose,msa_2624823827
"In this paper , we analyze the `` gradient descent '' form of GAN optimization ( i",Method,msa_2624823827
", the natural setting where we simultaneously take small gradient steps in both generator and discriminator parameters )",Method,msa_2624823827
"We show that even though GAN optimization does not correspond to a convex-concave game , even for simple parameterizations , under proper conditions , equilibrium points of this optimization procedure are still locally asymptotically stable for the traditional GAN formulation",Findings,msa_2624823827
"On the other hand , we show that the recently-proposed Wasserstein GAN can have non-convergent limit cycles near equilibrium",Findings,msa_2624823827
"Motivated by this stability analysis , we propose an additional regularization term for gradient descent GAN updates ,",Mechanism,msa_2624823827
Consider a stream of retweet events - how can we spot fraudulent lock-step behavior in such multi-aspect data ( i,Background,msa_2625814963
", tensors ) evolving over time ? Can we detect it in real time , with an accuracy guarantee ? Past studies have shown that dense subtensors tend to indicate anomalous or even fraudulent behavior in many tensor data , including social media , Wikipedia , and TCP dumps",Background,msa_2625814963
"Thus , several algorithms have been proposed for detecting dense subtensors rapidly and accurately",Purpose,msa_2625814963
"However , existing algorithms assume that tensors are static , while many real-world tensors , including those mentioned above , evolve over time",Purpose,msa_2625814963
"We propose DENSESTREAM , an incremental algorithm that maintains and updates a dense subtensor in a tensor stream ( i",Mechanism,msa_2625814963

Abstract : The multidisciplinary goal was to develop an integrated conceptualization of the mid-level encoding of 3D object structure from multiple surface cues,Purpose,msa_262595037
Psychophysical studies,Method,msa_262595037
"showed that depth continuity is a prerequisite for facilitation of Gabor target detection in the context of flanking Gabors , and that , similarly , surface continuity in purely disparity-defined slanted surfaces was strongly enhanced in distributed patch detections as a function of stimulus duration in this dual discrimination task",Findings,msa_262595037
The unprecedented dips of performance reduction in the component psychometric functions was captured,Purpose,msa_262595037
"in a computational model based on a novel Leaky Drift Diffusion Theory that we developed for the underlying neural signals , which can serve as an analytic basis for the time course of all neural decision processes",Mechanism,msa_262595037
"The time course of depth surface perception was studied in a coordinated trio of psychophysical , neurophysiological and functional imaging studies",Method,msa_262595037
", showing that the perceptual processing of disparity and integration of 3D surface information across depth cues has time courses of several seconds , attesting to complexity of the neural processing hardware",Findings,msa_262595037
Three complementary computational modeling projects from three collaborating laboratories,Mechanism,msa_262595037
"Deep learning models can take weeks to train on a single GPU-equipped machine , necessitating scaling out DL training to a GPU-cluster",Background,msa_2626721309
"However , current distributed DL implementations can scale poorly due to substantial parameter synchronization over the network , because the high throughput of GPUs allows more data batches to be processed per unit time than CPUs , leading to more frequent network synchronization",Purpose,msa_2626721309
"We present Poseidon , an efficient communication architecture",Mechanism,msa_2626721309
for distributed DL on GPUs,Purpose,msa_2626721309
"Poseidon exploits the layered model structures in DL programs to overlap communication and computation , reducing bursty network communication",Mechanism,msa_2626721309
"Moreover , Poseidon uses a hybrid communication scheme that optimizes the number of bytes required to synchronize each layer , according to layer properties and the number of machines",Mechanism,msa_2626721309
We show that Poseidon is applicable to different DL frameworks,Findings,msa_2626721309

Recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) have enabled countless new applications in the domain of aerial sensing,Background,msa_2626747016
"In scenarios such as intrusion detection , target tracking and facility monitoring it is important to reach a given area of interest ( AOI ) , and create an online data streaming connection to a monitoring ground station ( GS ) for immediate delivery of content to the operator",Background,msa_2626747016
"In previous work , we showed that a multi-hop line network can increase the range of the mission by finding the optimal number of relay UAVs , and their optimal placement",Background,msa_2626747016
"In this demo , we show that CSMA ( typical 802",Mechanism,msa_2626747016

"behaves poorly in this type of networks due to mutual interference ,",Purpose,msa_2626747016
"Gaussian belief propagation ( BP ) has been widely used for distributed inference in large-scale networks such as the smart grid , sensor networks , and social networks , where local measurements/observations are scattered over a wide geographical area",Background,msa_2626965100
One particular case is when two neighboring agents share a common observation,Background,msa_2626965100
"For example , to estimate voltage in the direct current ( DC ) power flow model , the current measurement over a power line is proportional to the voltage difference between two neighboring buses",Background,msa_2626965100
"When applying the Gaussian BP algorithm to this type of problem , the convergence condition remains an open issue",Purpose,msa_2626965100
"In this paper , we analyze the convergence properties",Purpose,msa_2626965100
of Gaussian BP for this pairwise linear Gaussian model,Mechanism,msa_2626965100
We show analytically,Method,msa_2626965100
Developing a remote exploit is not easy,Background,msa_2642053679
It requires a comprehensive understanding of a vulnerability and delicate techniques to bypass defense mechanisms,Background,msa_2642053679
"As a result , attackers may prefer to reuse an existing exploit and make necessary changes over developing a new exploit from scratch",Background,msa_2642053679
One such adaptation is the replacement of the original shellcode ( i,Background,msa_2642053679
", the attacker-injected code that is executed as the final step of the exploit ) in the original exploit with a replacement shellcode , resulting in a modified exploit that carries out the actions desired by the attacker as opposed to the original exploit author",Background,msa_2642053679
We call this a shellcode transplant,Background,msa_2642053679
"Current automated shellcode placement methods are insufficient because they over-constrain the replacement shellcode , and so can not be used to achieve shellcode transplant",Purpose,msa_2642053679
"For example , these systems consider the shellcode as an integrated memory chunk and require that the execution path of the modified exploit must be same as the original one",Purpose,msa_2642053679
"To resolve these issues ,",Purpose,msa_2642053679
"we present ShellSwap , a system that uses symbolic tracing , with a combination of shellcode layout remediation and path kneading",Mechanism,msa_2642053679
to achieve shellcode transplant,Purpose,msa_2642053679
We evaluated the ShellSwap system on a combination of 20 exploits and 5 pieces of shellcode that are independently developed and different from the original exploit,Method,msa_2642053679
The availability of large idea repositories ( e,Background,msa_2645731340
", the U",Background,msa_2645731340
patent database ) could significantly accelerate innovation and discovery by providing people with inspiration from solutions to analogous problems,Background,msa_2645731340
"However , finding useful analogies in these large , messy , real-world repositories remains a persistent challenge for either human or automated methods",Purpose,msa_2645731340
Previous approaches include costly hand-created databases that have high relational structure ( e,Purpose,msa_2645731340
", predicate calculus representations ) but are very sparse",Purpose,msa_2645731340
"Simpler machine-learning/information-retrieval similarity metrics can scale to large , natural-language datasets , but struggle to account for structural similarity , which is central to analogy",Purpose,msa_2645731340
"In this paper we explore the viability and value of learning simpler structural representations ,",Purpose,msa_2645731340
"specifically , `` problem schemas '' , which specify the purpose of a product and the mechanisms by which it achieves that purpose",Mechanism,msa_2645731340
Our approach combines crowdsourcing and recurrent neural networks to extract purpose and mechanism vector representations from product descriptions,Mechanism,msa_2645731340
We demonstrate that these learned vectors allow us to find analogies with higher precision and recall than traditional information-retrieval methods,Findings,msa_2645731340
"In an ideation experiment ,",Method,msa_2645731340
analogies retrieved by our models significantly increased people 's likelihood of generating creative ideas compared to analogies retrieved by traditional methods,Findings,msa_2645731340
Abstract Whole-genome assemblies of 19 placental mammals and two outgroup species were used to reconstruct the order and orientation of syntenic fragments in chromosomes of the eutherian ancestor and six other descendant ancestors leading to human,Purpose,msa_2654359665
"For ancestral chromosome reconstructions ,",Purpose,msa_2654359665
we developed an algorithm ( DESCHRAMBLER ) that probabilistically determines the adjacencies of syntenic fragments using chromosome-scale and fragmented genome assemblies,Mechanism,msa_2654359665
"The reconstructed chromosomes of the eutherian , boreoeutherian , and euarchontoglires ancestor each included > 80 % of the entire length of the human genome , whereas reconstructed chromosomes of the most recent common ancestor of simians , catarrhini , great apes , and humans and chimpanzees included > 90 % of human genome sequence",Mechanism,msa_2654359665
These high-coverage reconstructions permitted reliable identification of chromosomal rearrangements over 105 My of eutherian evolution,Mechanism,msa_2654359665
"Orangutan was found to have eight chromosomes that were completely conserved in homologous sequence order and orientation with the eutherian ancestor , the largest number for any species",Findings,msa_2654359665
"Ruminant artiodactyls had the highest frequency of intrachromosomal rearrangements , and interchromosomal rearrangements dominated in murid rodents",Findings,msa_2654359665
"A total of 162 chromosomal breakpoints in evolution of the eutherian ancestral genome to the human genome were identified ; however , the rate of rearrangements was significantly lower ( 0",Findings,msa_2654359665

"In this paper , we develop a temporal localization framework",Mechanism,msa_2672451823
for intense audio events in videos which addresses the problem,Purpose,msa_2672451823
The proposed method utilizes Localized Self-Paced Reranking ( LSPaR ) to refine the localization results,Mechanism,msa_2672451823
LSPaR utilizes samples from easy to noisier ones so that it can overcome the noisiness of the initial retrieval results from user-generated videos,Mechanism,msa_2672451823
"We revisit the classic problem of designing voting rules that aggregate objective opinions , in a setting where voters have noisy estimates of a true ranking of the alternatives",Purpose,msa_2682248474
Previous work has replaced structural assumptions on the noise with a worst-case approach that aims to choose an outcome that minimizes the maximum error with respect to any feasible true ranking,Background,msa_2682248474
This approach underlies algorithms that have recently been deployed on the social choice website RoboVote,Background,msa_2682248474

"Low-income families pay substantial portions of their total expenditure on household energy bills , making them vulnerable to rising energy costs",Background,msa_2695711017
Habitat for Humanity houses are built for low-income families and made affordable with volunteer work and construction material donations,Background,msa_2695711017
"Hence , the trade-off between the homesO initial construction costs and their life-time energy costs must be evaluated carefully",Purpose,msa_2695711017
This paper targets to support better-informed decisions that balance the affordability of certain construction materials with their potential for energy efficiency,Purpose,msa_2695711017
"In collaboration with Habitat for Humanity of Westchester , we created an energy simulation model of an existing low-income house and calculated the homeOs annual energy usage with different design alternatives for windows and walls",Mechanism,msa_2695711017
"The resulting estimated annual energy savings are then evaluated alongside their initial investment costs , which were retrieved from RS Means standard construction cost data and quotations from industry",Method,msa_2695711017
The results show that it is possible to reduce the energy cost of these houses without significantly increasing the construction costs through exploration of different wall and window options,Findings,msa_2695711017

It is known that such allocations can be computed using O ( n ln ( 1/e ) ) operations in the standard Robertson-Webb Model,Background,msa_2700737210

"The world is full of physical interfaces that are inaccessible to blind people , from microwaves and information kiosks to thermostats and checkout terminals",Background,msa_2726197498
"Blind people can not independently use such devices without at least first learning their layout , and usually only after labeling them with sighted assistance",Background,msa_2726197498
"To address this problem ,",Purpose,msa_2726197498
we introduce VizLens -- -a robust and interactive screen reader for interfaces in the real world,Mechanism,msa_2726197498
"VizLens users take a picture of an interface they would like to use , it is interpreted quickly and robustly by multiple crowd workers in parallel , and then computer vision is able to give interactive feedback and guidance to users to help them use the interface in real time",Mechanism,msa_2726197498
"Built on top of VizLens , we developed automatically generating tactile overlays to physical interfaces to provide blind people with a permanent static solution",Mechanism,msa_2726197498
Crowd work is an increasingly prevalent and important kind of work,Background,msa_2726886858
"Because of its flexible nature , crowd work may offer benefits for people with disabilities",Background,msa_2726886858
"Unfortunately , people with disabilities currently lack access to much of this work because the tasks that are posted are often inaccessible",Purpose,msa_2726886858
"In this paper , we first characterize the accessibility of the tasks posted to a popular crowd marketplace , Amazon Mechanical Turk , by performing manual and automatic checks on 120 tasks from several common types",Method,msa_2726886858
We then outline research directions that could have positive impact on this problem,Method,msa_2726886858
Providing navigation assistance to people with visual impairments often requires augmenting the environment with after-market technology,Background,msa_2727346536
"However , installing navigation infrastructure in large environments requires a critical mass of trained personnel",Purpose,msa_2727346536
"Recruiting , training and managing participants for such a task is difficult",Purpose,msa_2727346536

"What can humans compute in their heads ? We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols , games like Sudoku , Crossword Puzzles , Speed Chess , and so on",Background,msa_2729775856
The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads,Purpose,msa_2729775856
"For example , can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer -- - who sees the responses to random input -- - still can not infer responses to new inputs ? To address such questions ,",Purpose,msa_2729775856
How do the k-core structures of real-world graphs look like ? What are the common patterns and the anomalies ? How can we exploit them for applications ? A k-core is the maximal subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least k,Background,msa_2729780524
"This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis , graph visualization , and graph clustering",Background,msa_2729780524
"Here , we explore pervasive patterns related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from diverse domains",Purpose,msa_2729780524
Our discoveries are : ( 1 ) Mirror Pattern : coreness ( i,Findings,msa_2729780524
", maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core ) is strongly correlated with degree",Findings,msa_2729780524
( 2 ) Core-Triangle Pattern : degeneracy ( i,Findings,msa_2729780524
", maximum k such that the k-core exists ) obeys a 3-to-1 power-law with respect to the count of triangles",Findings,msa_2729780524

"Systems for providing mixed physical-virtual interaction on desktop surfaces have been proposed for decades , though no such systems have achieved widespread use",Background,msa_2730313461
"One major factor contributing to this lack of acceptance may be that these systems are not designed for the variety and complexity of actual work surfaces , which are often in flux and cluttered with physical objects",Purpose,msa_2730313461
"In this paper , we use an elicitation study and interviews to synthesize a list of ten interactive behaviors that desk-bound , digital interfaces should implement to support responsive cohabitation with physical objects",Method,msa_2730313461
"As a proof of concept , we implemented these interactive behaviors in a working augmented desk system",Method,msa_2730313461
"Given a bipartite graph of users and the products that they review , or followers and followees , how can we detect fake reviews or follows ? Existing fraud detection methods ( spectral , etc",Background,msa_2730363704
) try to identify dense subgraphs of nodes that are sparsely connected to the remaining graph,Background,msa_2730363704
"Fraudsters can evade these methods using camouflage , by adding reviews or follows with honest targets so that they look normal",Background,msa_2730363704
"Even worse , some fraudsters use hijacked accounts from honest users , and then the camouflage is indeed organic",Background,msa_2730363704
Our focus is to spot fraudsters in the presence of camouflage or hijacked accounts,Purpose,msa_2730363704
"We propose FRAUDAR , an algorithm that ( a ) is camouflage resistant , ( b ) provides upper bounds on the effectiveness of fraudsters , and ( c ) is effective in real-world data",Mechanism,msa_2730363704
Experimental results under various attacks,Method,msa_2730363704
show that FRAUDAR outperforms the top competitor in accuracy of detecting both camouflaged and non-camouflaged fraud,Findings,msa_2730363704

"Intelligent personalization systems are becoming increasingly reliant on contextually-relevant devices and services , such as those available within modern IoT deployments",Background,msa_2733283609
An IoT context may emerge -- -or become pervasive -- -when the intelligent system generates knowledge from dialogue-based interactions with the end-user ; the context is strengthened even further by incorporating state representations about the environment ( e,Background,msa_2733283609
", generated from wireless sensor data ) into the knowledge graph",Background,msa_2733283609
"This is crucial for pervasive applications like digital assistance in IoT , where context-aware systems need to adapt quickly : activities like leaving work home-bound , driving to the grocery store , arriving at home , and walking the dog , for example , can occur in a relatively short period of time -- -during which an intelligent assistant must be able to support user requests in a consistent and coherent manner",Background,msa_2733283609
"Given that computational ontologies can serve as semantic models for heterogeneous data , they are becoming increasingly viable for reasoning across different IoT contexts",Background,msa_2733283609
"This involves : ( a ) federation and dynamic pruning of multiple modular ontologies , ideally , to comprehensively capture only the knowledge that will facilitate execution of a multi-context task ; ( b ) fast consistency-checking and ontology-based inferences , aided by rules-based execution environments that can evaluate/transform ambient wireless sensor network ( WSN ) data , in real-time ; and ( c ) run-time execution of ontology-based control procedures , through rule-engine actuation commands sent across the WSN",Background,msa_2733283609
"Only by realizing these functionalities may intelligent systems be capable of reasoning over device properties , system states , and user activities , while appropriately delegating commands to other intelligent agents or other relevant IoT services",Purpose,msa_2733283609
"In this poster , we illustrate how a multi-context knowledge base can be structured on the basis of modular ontologies and integrated with a distributed rules-based inference engine in multiple smart-building environments ,",Mechanism,msa_2733283609
in order to enable scalable contextual reasoning for intelligent assistance,Purpose,msa_2733283609
Preliminary results are also discussed,Findings,msa_2733283609

Audio transcription is an important task for making content accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing,Background,msa_2734202546
"Much of the transcription work is increasingly done by crowd workers , people online who pick up the work as it becomes available often in small bits at a time",Background,msa_2734202546
Whereas work typically provides a ladder for skill development -- a series of opportunities to acquire new skills that lead to advancement -- crowd transcription work generally does not,Background,msa_2734202546
"To demonstrate how crowd work might create a skill ladder ,",Purpose,msa_2734202546
"we created Scopist , a JavaScript application for learning an efficient text-entry method known as stenotype while doing audio transcription tasks",Mechanism,msa_2734202546
"Scopist facilitates on-the-job learning to prepare crowd workers for remote , real-time captioning by supporting both touch-typing and chording",Mechanism,msa_2734202546
Real-time captioning is a difficult skill to master but is important for making live events accessible,Mechanism,msa_2734202546
We conducted 3 crowd studies of Scopist focusing on Scopist 's performance and support for learning,Method,msa_2734202546
We show that Scopist can distinguish touch-typing from stenotyping with 94 % accuracy,Findings,msa_2734202546
"Situational awareness involves the timely acquisition of knowledge about real-world events , distillation of those events into higher-level conceptual constructs , and their synthesis into a coherent context-sensitive view",Background,msa_2734607546

"At the same time , when users use social media , they generate valuable data that can be used to understand the patterns of human communication",Background,msa_2734923642
"In this article , we focus on the following important question : Can we identify and use patterns of human communication to decide whether a human or a bot controls a user ?",Purpose,msa_2734923642
The first contribution of this article is showing that the distribution of inter-arrival times ( IATs ) between postings,Method,msa_2734923642
"is characterized by following four patterns : ( i ) heavy-tails , ( ii ) periodic-spikes , ( iii ) correlation between consecutive values , and ( iv ) bimodallity",Findings,msa_2734923642
"As our second contribution , we propose a mathematical model named Act-M ( Activity Model )",Mechanism,msa_2734923642
We show that Act-M can accurately,Mechanism,msa_2734923642
fit the distribution of IATs,Purpose,msa_2734923642
from social media users,Mechanism,msa_2734923642
"Finally , we use Act-M to develop a method",Mechanism,msa_2734923642
that detects if users are bots based only on the timing of their postings,Purpose,msa_2734923642
"We validate Act-M using data from over 55 million postings from four social media services : Reddit , Twitter , Stack-Overflow , and Hacker-News",Method,msa_2734923642
"In this work , we introduce Video Question Answering in the temporal domain",Mechanism,msa_2735159761
"to infer the past , describe the present and predict the future",Purpose,msa_2735159761
We present an encoderdecoder approach using Recurrent Neural Networks to learn the temporal structures of videos and introduce a dual-channel ranking loss to answer multiple-choice questions,Mechanism,msa_2735159761
"We explore approaches for finer understanding of video content using the question form of fill-in-the-blank , and collect our Video Context QA dataset consisting of 109,895 video clips with a total duration of more than 1000 h from existing TACoS , MPII-MD and MEDTest 14 datasets",Method,msa_2735159761
"In addition , 390,744 corresponding questions are generated from annotations",Mechanism,msa_2735159761
Extensive experiments,Method,msa_2735159761
Generic generation and manipulation of text is challenging and has limited success compared to recent deep generative modeling in visual domain,Purpose,msa_2735642330
"This paper aims at generating plausible natural language sentences , whose attributes are dynamically controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics",Purpose,msa_2735642330
We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures,Mechanism,msa_2735642330
"With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples , explicit constraints on independent attribute controls , and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators , our model learns highly interpretable representations from even only word annotations , and produces realistic sentences with desired attributes",Mechanism,msa_2735642330
Quantitative evaluation,Method,msa_2735642330
"Nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function ; however , it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality",Background,msa_2736115574
"To elucidate this relationship , a high-throughput method for tracking any locus of interest is desirable",Purpose,msa_2736115574
"Here , we report an efficient and scalable method named SHACKTeR ( Short Homology and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Knock-in of a TetO Repeat )",Mechanism,msa_2736115574
for live cell imaging of specific chromosomal regions,Purpose,msa_2736115574
"Compared to alternatives , our method does not require a nearby repetitive sequence and it requires only two modifications to the genome : CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of an optimized TetO repeat and its visualization by TetR-EGFP expression",Mechanism,msa_2736115574
"Our simplified knock-in protocol , utilizing short homology arms integrated by PCR ,",Mechanism,msa_2736115574
was successful at labeling 9 different loci in HCT116 cells with up to 20 % efficiency,Findings,msa_2736115574
"These loci included both nuclear speckle-associated , euchromatin regions and nuclear lamina-associated , heterochromatin regions",Findings,msa_2736115574
"Robust hand detection and classification is one of the most crucial pre-processing steps to support human computer interaction , driver behavior monitoring , virtual reality , etc",Background,msa_2736668798
"This problem , however , is very challenging due to numerous variations of hand images in real-world scenarios",Purpose,msa_2736668798
This work presents a novel approach named Multiple Scale Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks ( MSRFCN ),Mechanism,msa_2736668798
"to robustly detect and classify human hand regions under various challenging conditions , e",Purpose,msa_2736668798
g,Purpose,msa_2736668798
"occlusions , illumination , low-resolutions",Purpose,msa_2736668798
"In this approach , the whole image is passed through the proposed fully convolutional network to compute score maps",Mechanism,msa_2736668798
Those score maps with their position-sensitive properties can help to efficiently address a dilemma between translation-invariance in classification and detection,Mechanism,msa_2736668798
"The method is evaluated on the challenging hand databases , i",Method,msa_2736668798

Abstract Server-side variability the idea that the same job can take longer to run on one server than another due to server-dependent factors isan increasingly important concern in many queueing systems,Background,msa_2736908928
"One strategy for overcoming server-side variability to achieve low response time is redundancy , under which jobs create copies of themselves and send these copies to multiple different servers , waiting for only one copy to complete service",Background,msa_2736908928
"Most of the existing theoretical work on redundancy has focused on developing bounds , approximations , and exact analysis to study the response time gains offered by redundancy",Background,msa_2736908928
"However , response time is not the only important metric in redundancy systems : in addition to providing low overall response time , the system should also be fair in the sense that no job class should have a worse mean response time in the system with redundancy than it did in the system before redundancy is allowed",Purpose,msa_2736908928
In this paper we use scheduling to address the simultaneous goals of ( 1 ) achieving low response time and ( 2 ) maintaining fairness across job classes,Purpose,msa_2736908928
We develop new exact analysis,Mechanism,msa_2736908928
for per-class response time,Purpose,msa_2736908928
under First-Come First-Served ( FCFS ) scheduling for a general type of system structure ;,Mechanism,msa_2736908928
our analysis,Method,msa_2736908928
shows that FCFS can be unfair in that it can hurt non-redundant jobs,Findings,msa_2736908928
"We then introduce the Least Redundant First ( LRF ) scheduling policy , which we prove is optimal with respect to overall system response time , but which can be unfair in that it can hurt the jobs that become redundant",Mechanism,msa_2736908928
"Finally , we introduce the Primaries First ( PF ) scheduling policy ,",Mechanism,msa_2736908928

Future frame prediction in videos is a promising avenue for unsupervised video representation learning,Background,msa_2739688911
Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video,Background,msa_2739688911

Matching function binaries -- the process of identifying similar functions among binary executables -- is a challenge that underlies many security applications such as malware analysis and patch-based exploit generation,Background,msa_596492259
Recent work tries to establish semantic similarity based on static analysis methods,Background,msa_596492259
"Unfortunately , these methods do not perform well if the compared binaries are produced by different compiler toolchains or optimization levels",Purpose,msa_596492259
"In this work , we propose blanket execution , a novel",Mechanism,msa_596492259
dynamic equivalence testing primitive,Purpose,msa_596492259
that achieves complete coverage by overriding the intended program logic,Mechanism,msa_596492259
Blanket execution collects the side effects of functions during execution under a controlled randomized environment,Mechanism,msa_596492259
"Two functions are deemed similar , if their corresponding side effects , as observed under the same environment , are similar too",Mechanism,msa_596492259
We implement our blanket execution technique in a system called BLEX,Mechanism,msa_596492259
We evaluate BLEX rigorously against the state of the art binary comparison tool BinDiff,Method,msa_596492259
"When comparing optimized and un-optimized executables from the popular GNU coreutils package ,",Method,msa_596492259
BLEX outperforms BinDiff by up to 3,Findings,msa_596492259
5 times in correctly identifying similar functions,Findings,msa_596492259
BLEX also outperforms BinDiff if the binaries have been compiled by different compilers,Findings,msa_596492259
"Using the functionality in BLEX , we have also built a binary search engine",Mechanism,msa_596492259

Complex systems are designed using the model-based design paradigm in which mathematical models of systems are created and checked against specifications,Background,msa_5990255
Cyber-physical systems ( CPS ) are complex systems in which the physical environment is sensed and controlled by computational or cyber elements possibly distributed over communication networks,Background,msa_5990255
"Various aspects of CPS design such as physical dynamics , software , control , and communication networking must interoperate correctly for correct functioning of the systems",Background,msa_5990255
"Modeling formalisms , analysis techniques and tools for designing these different aspects have evolved ind ependently , and remain dissimilar and disparate",Background,msa_5990255
There is no unifying formalism in which one can model all these aspects equally well,Background,msa_5990255
"Therefore , model-based design of CPS must make use of a collection of models in several different formalisms and use respective analysis methods and tools together to ensure correct system design",Purpose,msa_5990255
"To enable doing this in a formal manner ,",Purpose,msa_5990255
this thesis develops a framework,Mechanism,msa_5990255
for multi-model verification of cyber-physical systems,Purpose,msa_5990255
based on behavioral semantics,Mechanism,msa_5990255
Heterogeneity arising from the different interacting aspects of CPS design must be addressed in order to enable system-level verification,Mechanism,msa_5990255
"In current practice , there is no principled approach that deals with this modeling heterogeneity within a formal framework",Background,msa_5990255
We develop behavioral semantics to address heterogeneity in a general yet formal manner,Mechanism,msa_5990255
"Our framework makes no assumptions about the specifics of any particular formalism , therefore it readily supports various formalisms , techniques and tools",Mechanism,msa_5990255
"Models can be analyzed independently in isolation , supporting separation of concerns",Mechanism,msa_5990255
Mappings across heterogeneous semantic domains enable associations between analysis results,Mechanism,msa_5990255
Interdependencies across different models and specifications can be formally represented as constraints over parameters and verification can be carried out in a semantically consistent manner,Mechanism,msa_5990255

"Randomly mutating well-formed program inputs or simply fuzzing , is a highly effective and widely used strategy to find bugs in software",Background,msa_614438062
"Other than showing fuzzers find bugs , there has been little systematic effort in understanding the science of how to fuzz properly",Background,msa_614438062
"In this paper , we focus on how to mathematically formulate and reason about one critical aspect in fuzzing : how best to pick seed files to maximize the total number of bugs found during a fuzz campaign",Purpose,msa_614438062

A reliable and accurate biometric identification system must be able to distinguish individuals even in situations where their biometric signatures are very similar,Background,msa_630471727
"However , the strong similarity in the facial appearance of twins has complicated facial feature based recognition and has even compromised commercial face recognition systems",Purpose,msa_630471727
This paper addresses the above problem and,Purpose,msa_630471727
proposes two novel methods,Mechanism,msa_630471727
to distinguish identical twins,Purpose,msa_630471727
using ( 1 ) facial aging features and ( 2 ) asymmetry decomposition features,Mechanism,msa_630471727
"Facial aging features are extracted using Gabor filters from regions of the face that typically exhibit wrinkles and laugh lines , while Facial asymmetry decomposition based features are obtained by projecting the difference between the two left sides ( consisting of the left half of the face and its mirror ) and two right sides ( consisting of the right half of the face and its mirror ) of a face onto a subspace",Mechanism,msa_630471727
Feature vectors obtained using these methods were used for classification,Mechanism,msa_630471727
Experiments conducted on images of five types of twins from the University of Notre Dame ND-Twins database,Method,msa_630471727
indicate that both our proposed approaches achieve high identification rates and are hence quite promising at distinguishing twins,Findings,msa_630471727
Function identification is a fundamental challenge in reverse engineering and binary program analysis,Background,msa_646354405
"For instance , binary rewriting and control flow integrity rely on accurate function detection and identification in binaries",Background,msa_646354405
"Although many binary program analyses assume functions can be identified a priori , identifying functions in stripped binaries remains a challenge",Purpose,msa_646354405

We propose a new framework,Mechanism,msa_69112019
for single-channel source separation,Purpose,msa_69112019
that lies between the fully supervised and unsupervised setting,Mechanism,msa_69112019
"Instead of supervision , we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods",Mechanism,msa_69112019
to estimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signal decomposition,Purpose,msa_69112019
Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit for domains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision ; our motivating application is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data ( the separation of whole-home power signals into different energy uses ),Mechanism,msa_69112019
Here contextual supervision allows us,Mechanism,msa_69112019
to provide itemized energy usage,Purpose,msa_69112019
"for thousands homes , a task previously impossible due to the need for specialized data collection hardware",Mechanism,msa_69112019
"On smaller datasets which include labels ,",Method,msa_69112019

Computing equilibria of games is a central task in computer science,Background,msa_72488771
A large number of results are known for Nash equilibrium ( NE ),Background,msa_72488771

"When instead agents can form coalitions , NE is inadequate and an appropriate solution concept is strong Nash equilibrium ( SNE )",Purpose,msa_72488771
Few computational results are known about SNE,Purpose,msa_72488771
"In this paper , we first study the problem of verifying whether a strategy profile is an SNE",Purpose,msa_72488771
", showing that the problem is in P",Mechanism,msa_72488771
"We then design a spatial branch -- and -- bound algorithm to find an SNE ,",Mechanism,msa_72488771
"This paper explores how to find , track , and learn models of arbitrary objects in a video without a predefined method for object detection",Purpose,msa_73302357
"We present a model that localizes objects via unsupervised tracking while learning a representation of each object , avoiding the need for pre-built detectors",Mechanism,msa_73302357
Our model uses a dependent Dirichlet process mixture to capture the uncertainty in the number and appearance of objects and requires only spatial and color video data that can be efficiently extracted via frame differencing,Mechanism,msa_73302357
"We give two inference algorithms for use in both online and offline settings , and use them to perform accurate detection-free tracking on multiple real videos",Mechanism,msa_73302357

Safety critical systems often have shutdown mechanisms to bring the system to a safe state in the event of a malfunction,Background,msa_749373868

"Given a multimillion-node social network , how can we sum- marize connectivity pattern from the data , and how can we find unex- pected user behavior ?",Background,msa_81017276
In this paper we study a complete graph from a large who-follows-whom network and spot lockstep behavior that large groups of followers connect to the same groups of followees,Purpose,msa_81017276
Our first contribution is that we study strange patterns on the adjacency matrix and in the spectral subspaces with respect to several flavors of lockstep,Method,msa_81017276
"We discover that ( a ) the lockstep behavior on the graph shapes dense `` block '' in its adjacency matrix and creates `` ray '' in spectral subspaces , and ( b ) partially overlapping of the behavior shapes `` staircase '' in the matrix and creates `` pearl '' in the subspaces",Findings,msa_81017276
"The second contribution is that we provide a fast algorithm , using the discovery as a guide for practi- tioners ,",Mechanism,msa_81017276
to detect users who offer the lockstep behavior,Purpose,msa_81017276
We demonstrate that our approach is effective,Findings,msa_81017276
"Out of the many potential factors that determine which links form in a document citation network , two in particular are of high importance : first , a document may be cited based on its subject matterthis can be modeled by analyzing document content ; second , a document may be cited based on which other documents have previously cited itthis can be modeled by analyzing citation structure",Purpose,msa_813396089
Both factors are important for users to make informed decisions and choose appropriate citations as the network grows,Purpose,msa_813396089
"In this paper , we present a novel model that integrates the merits of content and citation analyses into a single probabilistic framework",Mechanism,msa_813396089
We demonstrate our model on three real-world citation networks,Method,msa_813396089

Automatically recognizing a large number of action categories from videos is of significant importance for video understanding,Background,msa_841113906
"Most existing works focused on the design of more discriminative feature representation , and have achieved promising results when the positive samples are enough",Purpose,msa_841113906
"However , very limited efforts were spent on recognizing a novel action without any positive exemplars , which is often the case in the real settings due to the large amount of action classes and the users ' queries dramatic variations",Purpose,msa_841113906
"To address this issue ,",Purpose,msa_841113906
"we propose to perform action recognition when no positive exemplars of that class are provided , which is often known as the zero-shot learning",Mechanism,msa_841113906
"Different from other zero-shot learning approaches , which exploit attributes as the intermediate layer for the knowledge transfer , our main contribution is SIR , which directly leverages the semantic inter-class relationships between the known and unknown actions followed by label transfer learning",Mechanism,msa_841113906

"To overcome this issue ,",Purpose,msa_94549128
we develop proof-aware refactorings for CPS,Mechanism,msa_94549128
"That is , we study model transformations on CPS and show how they correspond to relations on correctness proofs",Mechanism,msa_94549128
"As the main technical device , we show how the impact of model transformations on correctness can be characterized by different notions of refinement in differential dynamic logic",Mechanism,msa_94549128

Our contribution is three-fold,Mechanism,msa_961358888
"First , we explicitly show that local handcrafted features and CNNs share the same convolution-pooling network structure",Mechanism,msa_961358888
"Second , we propose to use independent subspace analysis ( ISA ) to learn descriptors for state-of-the-art handcrafted features",Mechanism,msa_961358888
"Third , we enhance ISA with two new improvements , which make our learned descriptors significantly outperform the handcrafted ones",Mechanism,msa_961358888

Designers of human computation systms often face the need to aggregate noisy information provided by multiple people,Background,msa_9921517
"While voting is often used for this purpose , the choice of voting method is typically not principled",Purpose,msa_9921517
We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk,Method,msa_9921517
to better understand how different voting rules perform in practice,Purpose,msa_9921517
Our empirical conclusions show that noisy human voting can differ from what popular theoretical models would predict,Findings,msa_9921517
The Poisson distribution has been widely studied and used for modeling univariate count-valued data,Background,pubmed_1
"Multivariate generalizations of the Poisson distribution that permit dependencies , however , have been far less popular",Background,pubmed_1
"Yet , real-world high-dimensional count-valued data found in word counts , genomics , and crime statistics , for example , exhibit rich dependencies , and motivate the need for multivariate distributions that can appropriately model this data",Purpose,pubmed_1
"We review multivariate distributions derived from the univariate Poisson , categorizing these models into three main classes : 1 ) where the marginal distributions are Poisson , 2 ) where the joint distribution is a mixture of independent multivariate Poisson distributions , and 3 ) where the node-conditional distributions are derived from the Poisson",Purpose,pubmed_1
We discuss the development of multiple instances of these classes and,Purpose,pubmed_1
compare the models in terms of interpretability and theory,Method,pubmed_1
"Then , we empirically compare multiple models from each class on three real-world datasets that have varying data characteristics from different domains , namely traffic accident data , biological next generation sequencing data , and text data",Method,pubmed_1
These empirical experiments develop intuition about the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each class of multivariate distribution that was derived from the Poisson,Findings,pubmed_1

We analyze naturally occurring datasets from student use of educational technologies,Method,pubmed_100
to explore a long-standing question of the scope of transfer of learning,Purpose,pubmed_100
We contrast a faculty theory of broad transfer with a component theory of more constrained transfer,Method,pubmed_100
"To test these theories ,",Purpose,pubmed_100
we develop statistical models of them,Mechanism,pubmed_100
These models use latent variables,Mechanism,pubmed_100
to represent mental functions that are changed while learning to cause a reduction in error rates for new tasks,Purpose,pubmed_100
Strong versions of these models provide a common explanation for the variance in task difficulty and transfer,Mechanism,pubmed_100
Weak versions decouple difficulty and transfer explanations by describing task difficulty with parameters for each unique task,Mechanism,pubmed_100
We evaluate these models in terms of both their prediction accuracy on held-out data and their power in explaining task difficulty and learning transfer,Method,pubmed_100
"In comparisons across eight datasets ,",Method,pubmed_100
we find that the component models provide both better predictions and better explanations than the faculty models,Findings,pubmed_100
"Weak model variations tend to improve generalization across students , but hurt generalization across items and make a sacrifice to explanatory power",Findings,pubmed_100
Current methods for depression assessment depend almost entirely on clinical interview or self-report ratings,Background,pubmed_101
Such measures lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of psychological disorder,Purpose,pubmed_101
We compared a clinical interview of depression severity with automatic measurement in 48 participants undergoing treatment for depression,Method,pubmed_101
Interviews were obtained at 7-week intervals on up to four occasions,Method,pubmed_101
"Following standard cut-offs , participants at each session were classified as remitted , intermediate , or depressed",Method,pubmed_101
"Logistic regression classifiers using leave-one-out validation were compared for facial movement dynamics , head movement dynamics , and vocal prosody individually and in combination",Method,pubmed_101
Accuracy ( remitted versus depressed ) for facial movement dynamics was higher than that for head movement dynamics ; and each was substantially higher than that for vocal prosody,Findings,pubmed_101
Accuracy for all three modalities together reached 88,Findings,pubmed_101
"93 % , exceeding that for any single modality or pair of modalities",Findings,pubmed_101
Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles produced in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV are presented,Purpose,pubmed_102
The data were taken with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 270__nb^ { -1 },Method,pubmed_102
The correlations are studied over a broad range of pseudorapidity ( |_| < 2,Method,pubmed_102
4 ) and over the full azimuth ( _ ) as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum ( p_ { T } ),Method,pubmed_102
"In high-multiplicity events , a long-range ( |__| > 2 ) , near-side ( __0 ) structure emerges in the two-particle __-__ correlation functions",Findings,pubmed_102
The magnitude of the correlation exhibits a pronounced maximum in the range 1 < p_ { T } < 2,Findings,pubmed_102
"0__GeV/c and an approximately linear increase with the charged particle multiplicity , with an overall correlation strength similar to that found in earlier pp data at sqrt [ s ] 0",Findings,pubmed_102
"The present measurement extends the study of near-side long-range correlations up to charged particle multiplicities N_ { ch } _180 , a region so far unexplored in pp collisions",Findings,pubmed_102

We created a citation network that linked the 62504 WoS records and their cited literature,Method,pubmed_109
"We performed a critical path analysis ( CPA ) , a specialized social network analysis on this citation network ( ~1",Method,pubmed_109

to highlight the main contributions in conflict research and to test if research on conflict has in fact evolved to represent a coherent field of inquiry,Purpose,pubmed_109
"Out of this vast dataset , 49 academic works were highlighted by the CPA suggesting a coherent field of inquiry ; which means that researchers in the field acknowledge seminal contributions and share a common knowledge base",Findings,pubmed_109
"Other conflict concepts that were also analyzed-such as interpersonal conflict or conflict among pharmaceuticals , for example ,",Method,pubmed_109
did not form their own CP,Findings,pubmed_109
"A single path formed , meaning that there was a cohesive set of ideas that built upon previous research",Findings,pubmed_109
"This is in contrast to a main path analysis of conflict from 1957-1971 where ideas did n't persist in that multiple paths existed and died or emerged reflecting lack of scientific coherence ( Carley , Hummon , and Harty , 1993 )",Background,pubmed_109
"The critical path consisted of a number of key features : 1 ) Concepts that built throughout include the notion that resource availability drives conflict , which emerged in the 1960s-1990s and continued on until 2011",Findings,pubmed_109
More recent intrastate studies that focused on inequalities emerged from interstate studies on the democracy of peace earlier on the path,Background,pubmed_109
"2 ) Recent research on the path focused on forecasting conflict , which depends on well-developed metrics and theories to model",Background,pubmed_109
3 ) We used keyword analysis to independently,Method,pubmed_109

Publically available conflict datasets developed early on helped shape the operationalization of conflict,Findings,pubmed_109
"In fact , 94 % of the works on the CP that analyzed data either relied on publically available datasets , or they generated a dataset and made it public",Findings,pubmed_109

The core premise of evidence-based medicine is that clinical decisions are informed by the peer-reviewed literature,Background,pubmed_110
"To extract meaningful conclusions from this literature , one must first understand the various forms of biases inherent within the process of peer review",Purpose,pubmed_110
We performed an exhaustive search that identified articles exploring the question of whether survival benefit was associated with maximal high-grade glioma ( HGG ) resection,Method,pubmed_110
and analysed this literature for patterns of publication,Purpose,pubmed_110
We found that the distribution of these 108 articles among the 26 journals to be non-random ( p < 0,Findings,pubmed_110
"01 ) , with 75 of the 108 published articles ( 69 % ) appearing in 6 of the 26 journals ( 25 % )",Findings,pubmed_110
"Moreover , certain journals were likely to publish a large number of articles from the same medical academic genealogy ( authors with shared training history and/or mentor )",Findings,pubmed_110
We term the tendency of certain types of articles to be published in select journals 'journal bias ',Findings,pubmed_110
Fluorescence microscopy is one of the most important tools in cell biology research because it provides spatial and temporal information to investigate regulatory systems inside cells,Background,pubmed_111
This technique can generate data in the form of signal intensities at thousands of positions resolved inside individual live cells,Background,pubmed_111
"However , given extensive cell-to-cell variation , these data can not be readily assembled into three- or four-dimensional maps of protein concentration that can be compared across different cells and conditions",Background,pubmed_111
We have developed a method,Mechanism,pubmed_111
to enable comparison of imaging data from many cells,Purpose,pubmed_111
and applied it,Mechanism,pubmed_111
to investigate actin dynamics in T cell activation,Purpose,pubmed_111
Antigen recognition in T cells by the T cell receptor ( TCR ) is amplified by engagement of the costimulatory receptor CD28,Mechanism,pubmed_111
We imaged actin and eight core actin regulators to generate over a thousand movies of T cells under conditions in which CD28 was either engaged or blocked in the context of a strong TCR signal,Mechanism,pubmed_111
Our computational analysis,Method,pubmed_111
"One goal of human genetics is to understand the genetic basis of disease , a challenge for diseases of complex inheritance because risk alleles are few relative to the vast set of benign variants",Background,pubmed_112
Risk variants are often sought by association studies in which allele frequencies in case subjects are contrasted with those from population-based samples used as control subjects,Background,pubmed_112
"In an ideal world we would know population-level allele frequencies , releasing researchers to focus on case subjects",Purpose,pubmed_112
"We argue this ideal is possible , at least theoretically , and we outline a path to achieving it in reality",Purpose,pubmed_112
"If such a resource were to exist , it would yield ample savings and would facilitate the effective use of data repositories by removing administrative and technical barriers",Background,pubmed_112
"We call this concept the Universal Control Repository Network ( UNICORN ) , a means",Mechanism,pubmed_112
to perform association analyses without necessitating direct access to individual-level control data,Purpose,pubmed_112
"Our approach to UNICORN uses existing genetic resources and various statistical tools to analyze these data , including hierarchical clustering with spectral analysis of ancestry ; and empirical Bayesian analysis along with Gaussian spatial processes to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies",Mechanism,pubmed_112
"We demonstrate our approach using tens of thousands of control subjects from studies of Crohn disease ,",Method,pubmed_112

"Multifunctional polymer-based composites have been widely used in various research and industrial applications , such as flexible and stretchable electronics and sensors and sensor-integrated smart structures",Background,pubmed_116
This study investigates the influence of particle coalescence on the mechanical and electrical properties of spherical nickel powder ( SNP ) /polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) composites in which SNP was aligned using an external magnetic field,Purpose,pubmed_116
"With the increase of the volume fraction of the SNP , the aligned SNP/PDMS composites exhibited a higher tensile strength and a lower ultimate strain",Findings,pubmed_116
"In addition , the composites with aligned SNP showed a lower percolation threshold and a higher electrical conductivity compared with those with randomly dispersed SNP",Findings,pubmed_116

Maximum-a-Posteriori ( MAP ) inference lies at the heart of Graphical Models and Structured Prediction,Background,pubmed_12
"Despite the intractability of exact MAP inference , approximate methods based on LP relaxations have exhibited superior performance across a wide range of applications",Background,pubmed_12
Yet for problems involving large output domains ( i,Purpose,pubmed_12
", the state space for each variable is large ) , standard LP relaxations can easily give rise to a large number of variables and constraints which are beyond the limit of existing optimization algorithms",Purpose,pubmed_12
"In this paper , we introduce an effective MAP inference method for problems with large output domains",Mechanism,pubmed_12
The method builds upon alternating minimization of an Augmented Lagrangian that exploits the sparsity of messages through greedy optimization techniques,Mechanism,pubmed_12
A key feature of our greedy approach is to introduce variables in an on-demand manner with a pre-built data structure over local factors,Mechanism,pubmed_12
This results in a single-loop algorithm of sublinear cost per iteration and O ( log ( 1/_ ) ) nan iteration complexity to achieve _ sub-optimality,Findings,pubmed_12

but are there regularities obeyed by the r-hop neighborhood in real networks ? We answer this question,Purpose,pubmed_121
by identifying another power-law pattern that describes the relationship between the fractions of node pairs C ( r ) within r hops and the hop count r,Mechanism,pubmed_121
"This scale-free distribution is pervasive and describes a large variety of networks , ranging from social and urban to technological and biological networks",Mechanism,pubmed_121
"In particular , inspired by the definition of the fractal correlation dimension D2 on a point-set , we consider the hop-count r to be the underlying distance metric between two vertices of the network , and we examine the scaling of C ( r ) with r",Mechanism,pubmed_121
"We find that this relationship follows a power-law in real networks within the range 2 r d , where d is the effective diameter of the network , that is , the 90-th percentile distance",Findings,pubmed_121

"Despite the enormous medical impact of cancers and intensive study of their biology , detailed characterization of tumor growth and development remains elusive",Background,pubmed_125
"This difficulty occurs in large part because of enormous heterogeneity in the molecular mechanisms of cancer progression , both tumor-to-tumor and cell-to-cell in single tumors",Background,pubmed_125
"Advances in genomic technologies , especially at the single-cell level , are improving the situation , but these approaches are held back by limitations of the biotechnologies for gathering genomic data from heterogeneous cell populations and the computational methods for making sense of those data",Background,pubmed_125
One popular way to gain the advantages of whole-genome methods without the cost of single-cell genomics has been the use of computational deconvolution ( unmixing ) methods to reconstruct clonal heterogeneity from bulk genomic data,Background,pubmed_125
"These methods , too , are limited by the difficulty of inferring genomic profiles of rare or subtly varying clonal subpopulations from bulk data , a problem that can be computationally reduced to that of reconstructing the geometry of point clouds of tumor samples in a genome space",Purpose,pubmed_125

Central to Bayesian inference is the notion of statistical priors,Background,pubmed_129

"Robust , efficient , and low-cost networks are advantageous in both biological and engineered systems",Background,pubmed_152
"During neural network development in the brain , synapses are massively over-produced and then pruned-back over time",Background,pubmed_152
"This strategy is not commonly used when designing engineered networks , since adding connections that will soon be removed is considered wasteful",Background,pubmed_152
"Here , we show that for large distributed routing networks , network function is markedly enhanced by hyper-connectivity followed by aggressive pruning and that the global rate of pruning , a developmental parameter not previously studied by experimentalists , plays a critical role in optimizing network structure",Purpose,pubmed_152
We first used high-throughput image analysis techniques to quantify the rate of pruning in the mammalian neocortex across a broad developmental time window,Method,pubmed_152
and found that the rate is decreasing over time,Findings,pubmed_152
"Based on these results , we analyzed a model of computational routing networks",Method,pubmed_152
and show,Findings,pubmed_152
using both theoretical analysis and simulations,Method,pubmed_152
that decreasing rates lead to more robust and efficient networks compared to other rates,Findings,pubmed_152

"These circumstances account for $ 28 billion direct costs annually and given the latest predictions , these costs will more than triple by 2030",Background,pubmed_158
"In our research , we propose a portfolio of serious games",Mechanism,pubmed_158
for home-based stroke rehabilitation,Purpose,pubmed_158
"The objective of the game approach is to enrich the training experience and establish a higher level of compliance to prescribed exercises , while maintaining a supportive training environment as found in common therapy sessions",Purpose,pubmed_158
"Our system provides a collection of mini games based on rehabilitation exercises used in conventional physical therapy , monitors the patient 's performance while exercising and provides clinicians with an interface to personalize the training",Mechanism,pubmed_158
The clinician can set the current state of rehabilitation and change the playable games over time to drive diversification,Mechanism,pubmed_158

"Analogous to genomic sequence alignment , biological network alignment identifies conserved regions between networks of different species",Background,pubmed_160
"Then , function can be transferred from well- to poorly-annotated species between aligned network regions",Background,pubmed_160
"Network alignment typically encompasses two algorithmic components : node cost function ( NCF ) , which measures similarities between nodes in different networks , and alignment strategy ( AS ) , which uses these similarities to rapidly identify high-scoring alignments",Background,pubmed_160
Different methods use both different NCFs and different ASs,Background,pubmed_160
"Thus , it is unclear whether the superiority of a method comes from its NCF , its AS , or both",Background,pubmed_160
"We already showed on state-of-the-art methods , MI-GRAAL and IsoRankN , that combining NCF of one method and AS of another method can give a new superior method",Background,pubmed_160

"While doing so , we approach important questions that have not been asked systematically thus far",Purpose,pubmed_160
"First , we ask how much of the NCF information should come from protein sequence data compared to network topology data",Purpose,pubmed_160
"Existing methods determine this parameter more-less arbitrarily , which could affect alignment quality",Background,pubmed_160
"Second , when topological information is used in NCF , we ask how large the size of the neighborhoods of the compared nodes should be",Purpose,pubmed_160

"In studying the strength and specificity of interaction between members of two protein families , key questions center on which pairs of possible partners actually interact , how well they interact , and why they interact while others do not",Background,pubmed_163
The advent of large-scale experimental studies of interactions between members of a target family and a diverse set of possible interaction partners offers the opportunity to address these questions,Purpose,pubmed_163

using a handheld micromanipulator known as Micron,Mechanism,pubmed_167
The novel handheld manipulator enables the automated scanning of a laser probe within a cylinder of 4 mm long and 4 mm in diameter,Mechanism,pubmed_167
"For the automation , the surface of the retina is reconstructed using a stereomicroscope , and then preplanned targets are placed on the surface",Mechanism,pubmed_167
"The laser probe is precisely located on the target via visual servoing of the aiming beam , while maintaining a specific distance above the surface",Mechanism,pubmed_167
"In addition , the system is capable of tracking the surface of the eye in order to compensate for any eye movement introduced during the operation",Mechanism,pubmed_167
"We compared the performance of the automated scanning using various control thresholds , in order to find the most effective threshold in terms of accuracy and speed",Method,pubmed_167

we conducted the handheld operation above a fixed target surface,Method,pubmed_167
"Many organisms move using traveling waves of body undulation , and most work has focused on single-plane undulations in fluids",Background,pubmed_169
"Less attention has been paid to multiplane undulations , which are particularly important in terrestrial environments where vertical undulations can regulate substrate contact",Purpose,pubmed_169
"A seemingly complex mode of snake locomotion , sidewinding , can be described by the superposition of two waves : horizontal and vertical body waves with a phase difference of 90",Background,pubmed_169
We demonstrate that the high maneuverability displayed by sidewinder rattlesnakes ( Crotalus cerastes ) emerges from the animal 's ability to independently modulate these waves,Purpose,pubmed_169
"Sidewinder rattlesnakes used two distinct turning methods , which we term differential turning ( 26 change in orientation per wave cycle ) and reversal turning ( 89 )",Method,pubmed_169
Observations of the snakes,Method,pubmed_169
suggested that during differential turning the animals imposed an amplitude modulation in the horizontal wave whereas in reversal turning they shifted the phase of the vertical wave by 180,Findings,pubmed_169
"We tested these mechanisms using a multimodule snake robot as a physical model , successfully generating differential and reversal turning with performance comparable to that of the organisms",Mechanism,pubmed_169
Further manipulations of the two-wave system,Method,pubmed_169
"revealed a third turning mode , frequency turning , not observed in biological snakes , which produced large ( 127 ) in-place turns",Findings,pubmed_169
The two-wave system thus functions as a template ( a targeted motor pattern ) that enables complex behaviors in a high-degree-of-freedom system to emerge from relatively simple modulations to a basic pattern,Findings,pubmed_169

The quantitative relationship between presynaptic calcium influx and transmitter release critically depends on the spatial coupling of presynaptic calcium channels to synaptic vesicles,Background,pubmed_177
"When there is a close association between calcium channels and synaptic vesicles , the flux through a single open calcium channel may be sufficient to trigger transmitter release",Background,pubmed_177
"With increasing spatial distance , however , a larger number of open calcium channels might be required to contribute sufficient calcium ions to trigger vesicle fusion",Purpose,pubmed_177
"Here we used a combination of pharmacological calcium channel block , high-resolution calcium imaging , postsynaptic recording , and 3D Monte Carlo reaction-diffusion simulations in the adult frog neuromuscular junction ,",Method,pubmed_177

Undirected graphical models are important in a number of modern applications that involve exploring or exploiting dependency structures underlying the data,Background,pubmed_178
"For example , they are often used to explore complex systems where connections between entities are not well understood , such as in functional brain networks or genetic networks",Background,pubmed_178
"Existing methods for estimating structure of undirected graphical models focus on scenarios where each node represents a scalar random variable , such as a binary neural activation state or a continuous mRNA abundance measurement , even though in many real world problems , nodes can represent multivariate variables with much richer meanings , such as whole images , text documents , or multi-view feature vectors",Purpose,pubmed_178
"In this paper , we propose a new principled framework",Mechanism,pubmed_178
for estimating the structure of undirected graphical models from such multivariate ( or multi-attribute ) nodal data,Purpose,pubmed_178
The structure of a graph is inferred through estimation of non-zero partial canonical correlation between nodes,Mechanism,pubmed_178
"Under a Gaussian model , this strategy is equivalent to estimating conditional independencies between random vectors represented by the nodes and it generalizes the classical problem of covariance selection ( Dempster , 1972 )",Mechanism,pubmed_178
We relate the problem of estimating non-zero partial canonical correlations to maximizing a penalized Gaussian likelihood objective and develop a method that efficiently maximizes this objective,Mechanism,pubmed_178

Individuals who exhibit large-magnitude blood pressure ( BP ) reactions to acute psychological stressors are at risk for hypertension and premature death by cardiovascular disease,Background,pubmed_18
"This study tested whether a multivariate pattern of stressor-evoked brain activity could reliably predict individual differences in BP reactivity ,",Purpose,pubmed_18
"In the sparse linear regression setting , we consider testing the significance of the predictor variable that enters the current lasso model , in the sequence of models visited along the lasso solution path",Purpose,pubmed_180
"We propose a simple test statistic based on lasso fitted values , called the covariance test statistic , and",Mechanism,pubmed_180
"show that when the 1 model is linear , this statistic has an Exp ( 1 ) asymptotic distribution under the nan hypothesis ( the nan being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso model )",Findings,pubmed_180
Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to enter the model ( i,Mechanism,pubmed_180
", testing for a single significant predictor variable against the global nan ) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix X",Mechanism,pubmed_180
"On the other hand , our proof for a general step in the lasso path places further technical assumptions on X and the generative model , but still allows for the important high-dimensional case p > n , and does not necessarily require that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active variables",Mechanism,pubmed_180
"Of course , for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models , one typically uses the chi-squared test , comparing the drop in residual sum of squares ( RSS ) to a [ Formula : see text ] distribution",Background,pubmed_180
"But when this additional variable is not fixed , and has been chosen adaptively or greedily , this test is no longer appropriate : adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than [ Formula : see text ] under the nan hypothesis",Purpose,pubmed_180
Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity,Purpose,pubmed_180
Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dynamical systems,Background,pubmed_181
These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff between computational and statistical efficiency,Background,pubmed_181
"Unfortunately , they can be difficult to use and extend in practice : e",Purpose,pubmed_181
", they can make it difficult to incorporate prior information such as sparsity or structure",Purpose,pubmed_181
"To address this problem ,",Purpose,pubmed_181
"we present a new view of dynamical system learning : we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems , thereby allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as L1 regularization",Mechanism,pubmed_181
"Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new framework , using linear regression as the supervised learner",Mechanism,pubmed_181
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does ;,Method,pubmed_181
"While studies show that autism is highly heritable , the nature of the genetic basis of this disorder remains illusive",Background,pubmed_182

Fluctuations in the growth rate of a bacterial culture during unbalanced growth are generally considered undesirable in quantitative studies of bacterial physiology,Background,pubmed_205

Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of microns,Background,pubmed_224
"To achieve these tasks , surgeons use tools of diameter 0",Background,pubmed_224
9 mm or less to access the eye 's interior structures,Background,pubmed_224
"The level of force required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile threshold , requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback",Purpose,pubmed_224
"However , both of these methods can lead to tissue damage",Purpose,pubmed_224
"Excursions can be made into tissues which are not felt by the surgeon , while larger forces have a higher chance of damaging tissue within the eye",Purpose,pubmed_224

Overview,Background,pubmed_226
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) indicators are widely used in the general population to determine the burden of disease , identify health needs , and direct public health policy",Background,pubmed_226
These indicators also allow the burden of illness to be compared across different diseases,Background,pubmed_226
"Although Lyme disease has recently been acknowledged as a major health threat in the USA with more than 300000 new cases per year , no comprehensive assessment of the health burden of this tickborne disease is available",Background,pubmed_226
This study assesses the HRQoL of patients with chronic Lyme disease ( CLD ) and compares the severity of CLD to other chronic conditions,Method,pubmed_226
Methods,Method,pubmed_226
"Of 5357 subjects who responded to an online survey , 3090 were selected for the study",Method,pubmed_226
Respondents were characterized as having CLD if they were clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease and had persisting symptoms lasting more than 6 months following antibiotic treatment,Method,pubmed_226
HRQoL of CLD patients was assessed using the CDC 9-item metric,Method,pubmed_226
The HRQoL analysis for CLD was compared to published analyses for the general population and other chronic illnesses using standard statistical methods,Method,pubmed_226
Results,Findings,pubmed_226
"Compared to the general population and patients with other chronic diseases reviewed here , patients with CLD reported significantly lower health quality status , more bad mental and physical health days , a significant symptom disease burden , and greater activity limitations",Findings,pubmed_226
"They also reported impairment in their ability to work , increased utilization of healthcare services , and greater out of pocket medical costs",Findings,pubmed_226
Conclusions,Findings,pubmed_226
CLD patients have significantly impaired HRQoL and greater healthcare utilization compared to the general population and patients with other chronic diseases,Findings,pubmed_226
Performing micromanipulation and delicate operations in submillimeter workspaces is difficult because of destabilizing tremor and imprecise targeting,Background,pubmed_228
"Accurate micromanipulation is especially important for microsurgical procedures , such as vitreoretinal surgery , to maximize successful outcomes and minimize collateral damage",Background,pubmed_228
"Robotic aid combined with filtering techniques that suppress tremor frequency bands increases performance ; however , if knowledge of the operator 's goals is available , virtual fixtures have been shown to further improve performance",Purpose,pubmed_228
"In this paper , we derive a virtual fixture framework for active handheld micromanipulators that is based on high-bandwidth position measurements rather than forces applied to a robot handle",Mechanism,pubmed_228
"For applicability in surgical environments , the fixtures are generated in real-time from microscope video during the procedure",Mechanism,pubmed_228
"Additionally , we develop motion scaling behavior around virtual fixtures as a simple and direct extension to the proposed framework",Mechanism,pubmed_228
We demonstrate that virtual fixtures significantly outperform tremor cancellation algorithms on a set of synthetic tracing tasks ( p < 0,Findings,pubmed_228
05 ),Findings,pubmed_228
"In more medically relevant experiments of vein tracing and membrane peeling in eye phantoms ,",Method,pubmed_228
Population stratification is an important task in genetic analyses,Background,pubmed_229
It provides information about the ancestry of individuals and can be an important confounder in genome-wide association studies,Background,pubmed_229
Public genotyping projects have made a large number of datasets available for study,Background,pubmed_229
"However , practical constraints dictate that of a geographical/ethnic population , only a small number of individuals are genotyped",Background,pubmed_229
The resulting data are a sample from the entire population,Background,pubmed_229
"If the distribution of sample sizes is not representative of the populations being sampled , the accuracy of population stratification analyses of the data could be affected",Purpose,pubmed_229
We attempt to understand the effect of biased sampling on the accuracy of population structure analysis and individual ancestry recovery,Purpose,pubmed_229
"We examined two commonly used methods for analyses of such datasets , ADMIXTURE and EIGENSOFT , and",Method,pubmed_229
found that the accuracy of recovery of population structure is affected to a large extent by the sample used for analysis and how representative it is of the underlying populations,Findings,pubmed_229
"Using simulated data and real genotype data from cattle ,",Method,pubmed_229
we show that sample selection bias can affect the results of population structure analyses,Findings,pubmed_229
We develop a mathematical framework,Mechanism,pubmed_229
for sample selection bias,Purpose,pubmed_229
in models for population structure and also proposed a correction for sample selection bias using auxiliary information about the sample,Mechanism,pubmed_229
We demonstrate that such a correction is effective in practice,Findings,pubmed_229
"Can we use graph mining algorithms to find patterns in tumor molecular mechanisms ? Can we model disease progression with multiple time-specific graph comparison algorithms ? In this paper , we will focus on this area",Purpose,pubmed_23
Our main contributions are 1 ) we proposed the Temporal-Omics ( Temp-O ) workflow,Mechanism,pubmed_23
to model tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ),Purpose,pubmed_23
"using graph comparisons between multiple stage-specific graphs , and",Mechanism,pubmed_23
2 ) we showed that temporal structures are meaningful in the tumor progression of NSCLC,Findings,pubmed_23
Other identified temporal structures that were not highlighted in this paper may also be used to gain insights to possible novel mechanisms,Background,pubmed_23
"Importantly , the Temp-O workflow is generic ; while we applied it on NSCLC , it can be applied in other cancers and diseases",Background,pubmed_23
"We used gene expression data from tumor samples across disease stages to model lung cancer progression , creating stage-specific tumor graphs",Mechanism,pubmed_23
Validating our findings in independent datasets,Method,pubmed_23
showed that differences in temporal network structures capture diverse mechanisms in NSCLC,Findings,pubmed_23
"Furthermore , results showed that structures are consistent and potentially biologically important as we observed that genes with similar protein names were captured in the same cliques for all cliques in all datasets",Findings,pubmed_23
"Importantly , the identified temporal structures are meaningful in the tumor progression of NSCLC as",Background,pubmed_23
they agree with the molecular mechanism in the tumor progression or carcinogenesis of NSCLC,Findings,pubmed_23
"In particular , the identified major histocompatibility complex of class II temporal structures capture mechanisms concerning carcinogenesis ; the proteasome temporal structures capture mechanisms that are in early or late stages of lung cancer ; the ribosomal cliques capture the role of ribosome biosynthesis in cancer development and sustainment",Findings,pubmed_23

Matched field processing is a model-based framework for localizing targets in complex propagation environments,Background,pubmed_231
"In underwater acoustics , it has been extensively studied for improving localization performance in multimodal and multipath media",Background,pubmed_231
"For guided wave structural health monitoring problems , matched field processing has not been widely applied but is an attractive option for damage localization due to equally complex propagation environments",Background,pubmed_231
"Although effective , matched field processing is often challenging to implement because it requires accurate models of the propagation environment , and the optimization methods used to generate these models are often unreliable and computationally expensive",Purpose,pubmed_231
"To address these obstacles ,",Purpose,pubmed_231
"this paper introduces data-driven matched field processing , a framework",Mechanism,pubmed_231

", and then use these models",Mechanism,pubmed_231

"Recent technological advances coupled with large sample sets have uncovered many factors underlying the genetic basis of traits and the predisposition to complex disease , but much is left to discover",Background,pubmed_234
A common thread to most genetic investigations is familial relationships,Background,pubmed_234
"Close relatives can be identified from family records , and more distant relatives can be inferred from large panels of genetic markers",Background,pubmed_234
"Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be noisy , especially regarding distant relatives",Purpose,pubmed_234
We propose a new method,Mechanism,pubmed_234
for denoising genetically-inferred relationship matrices,Purpose,pubmed_234
by exploiting the underlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals,Mechanism,pubmed_234
"The approach , which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing , employs a multiscale decomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise relationships",Mechanism,pubmed_234
"On both simulated and real data ,",Method,pubmed_234
we show that smoothing leads to better estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals,Findings,pubmed_234
We illustrate our method,Findings,pubmed_234
with a large genome-wide association study and estimate the `` heritability '' of body mass index quite accurately,Method,pubmed_234
"Traditionally heritability , defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable to additive genetic effects , is estimated from samples of closely related individuals using random effects models",Method,pubmed_234
We show that by using smoothed relationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based samples,Findings,pubmed_234
Good feature design is important to achieve effective image classification,Background,pubmed_235
This paper presents a novel feature design with two main contributions,Mechanism,pubmed_235
"First , prior to computing the feature descriptors ,",Mechanism,pubmed_235
we propose to transform the images,Purpose,pubmed_235
with learning-based filters,Mechanism,pubmed_235
to obtain more representative feature descriptors,Purpose,pubmed_235
"Second , we propose",Mechanism,pubmed_235
to transform the computed descriptors,Purpose,pubmed_235
with another set of learning-based filters,Mechanism,pubmed_235
to further improve the classification accuracy,Purpose,pubmed_235
"In this way , while generic feature descriptors are used , data-adaptive information is integrated into the feature extraction process based on the optimization objective to enhance the discriminative power of feature descriptors",Mechanism,pubmed_235
"The feature design is applicable to different application domains ,",Background,pubmed_235
and is evaluated on both lung tissue classification in high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) images and apoptosis detection in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy image sequences,Method,pubmed_235

This paper presents a fast and efficient computational approach to higher order spectral graph matching,Purpose,pubmed_241
"Exploiting the redundancy in a tensor representing the affinity between feature points , we approximate the affinity tensor with the linear combination of Kronecker products between bases and index tensors",Mechanism,pubmed_241
"The bases and index tensors are highly compressed representations of the approximated affinity tensor , requiring much smaller memory than in previous methods , which store the full affinity tensor",Mechanism,pubmed_241
We compute the principal eigenvector of the approximated affinity tensor using the small bases and index tensors without explicitly storing the approximated tensor,Mechanism,pubmed_241
"To compensate for the loss of matching accuracy by the approximation , we also adopt and incorporate a marginalization scheme that maps a higher order tensor to matrix as well as a one-to-one mapping constraint into the eigenvector computation process",Mechanism,pubmed_241

We describe the design and control of a wearable robotic device powered by pneumatic artificial muscle actuators,Mechanism,pubmed_243
for use in ankle-foot rehabilitation,Purpose,pubmed_243
"The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of the human foot and lower leg , mimicking the morphology and the functionality of the biological muscle-tendon-ligament structure",Mechanism,pubmed_243
A key feature of the device is its soft structure that provides active assistance without restricting natural degrees of freedom at the ankle joint,Mechanism,pubmed_243
Four pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion,Mechanism,pubmed_243
The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait pattern analysis,Mechanism,pubmed_243
"For the subject tested , the prototype is capable of generating an ankle range of motion of 27 ( 14 dorsiflexion and 13 plantarflexion )",Findings,pubmed_243
The controllability of the system is,Findings,pubmed_243
experimentally demonstrated using a linear time-invariant ( LTI ) controller,Method,pubmed_243
"The controller is found using an identified LTI model of the system , resulting from the interaction of the soft orthotic device with a human leg , and model-based classical control design techniques",Method,pubmed_243
The suitability of the proposed control strategy is,Findings,pubmed_243
"Virus capsid assembly has been widely studied as a biophysical system , both for its biological and medical significance and as an important model for complex self-assembly processes",Background,pubmed_244
No current technology can monitor assembly in detail and what information we have on assembly kinetics comes exclusively from in vitro studies,Background,pubmed_244
"There are many differences between the intracellular environment and that of an in vitro assembly assay , however , that might be expected to alter assembly pathways",Background,pubmed_244
"Here , we explore one specific feature characteristic of the intracellular environment and known to have large effects on macromolecular assembly processes : molecular crowding",Purpose,pubmed_244
"We combine prior particle simulation methods for estimating crowding effects with coarse-grained stochastic models of capsid assembly , using the crowding models to adjust kinetics of capsid simulations",Mechanism,pubmed_244
to examine possible effects of crowding on assembly pathways,Purpose,pubmed_244
Simulations,Method,pubmed_244
"suggest a striking difference depending on whether or not a system uses nucleation-limited assembly , with crowding tending to promote off-pathway growth in a nonnucleation-limited model but often enhancing assembly efficiency at high crowding levels even while impeding it at lower crowding levels in a nucleation-limited model",Findings,pubmed_244
"Computational cancer phylogenetics seeks to enumerate the temporal sequences of aberrations in tumor evolution , thereby delineating the evolution of possible tumor progression pathways , molecular subtypes , and mechanisms of action",Background,pubmed_245
We previously developed a pipeline for constructing phylogenies describing evolution between major recurring cell types computationally inferred from whole-genome tumor profiles,Background,pubmed_245
"The accuracy and detail of the phylogenies , however , depend on the identification of accurate , high-resolution molecular markers of progression , i",Purpose,pubmed_245
", reproducible regions of aberration that robustly differentiate different subtypes and stages of progression",Purpose,pubmed_245
"Here , we present a novel hidden Markov model ( HMM ) scheme",Mechanism,pubmed_245
for the problem of inferring such phylogenetically significant markers,Purpose,pubmed_245
through joint segmentation and calling of multisample tumor data,Mechanism,pubmed_245
Our method classifies sets of genome-wide DNA copy number measurements into a partitioning of samples into normal ( diploid ) or amplified at each probe,Mechanism,pubmed_245
"It differs from other similar HMM methods in its design specifically for the needs of tumor phylogenetics , by seeking to identify robust markers of progression conserved across a set of copy number profiles",Mechanism,pubmed_245
We show,Findings,pubmed_245
"an analysis of our method in comparison to other methods on both synthetic and real tumor data ,",Method,pubmed_245
"In many behavioral domains , such as facial expression and gesture , sparse structure is prevalent",Background,pubmed_246
This sparsity would be well suited for event detection but for one problem,Purpose,pubmed_246
Features typically are confounded by alignment error in space and time,Purpose,pubmed_246
"As a consequence , high-dimensional representations such as SIFT and Gabor features have been favored despite their much greater computational cost and potential loss of information",Background,pubmed_246
We propose a Kernel Structured Sparsity ( KSS ) method,Mechanism,pubmed_246
"that can handle both the temporal alignment problem and the structured sparse reconstruction within a common framework , and it can rely on simple features",Purpose,pubmed_246
We characterize spatio-temporal events as time-series of motion patterns and by utilizing time-series kernels we apply standard structured-sparse coding techniques to tackle this important problem,Mechanism,pubmed_246
We evaluated the KSS method using both gesture and facial expression datasets that include spontaneous behavior and differ in degree of difficulty and type of ground truth coding,Method,pubmed_246
We present a novel device mounted on the fingertip,Mechanism,pubmed_247
for acquiring and transmitting visual information through haptic channels,Purpose,pubmed_247
"In contrast to previous systems in which the user interrogates an intermediate representation of visual information , such as a tactile display representing a camera generated image ,",Background,pubmed_247
our device uses a fingertip-mounted camera and haptic stimulator to allow the user to feel visual features directly from the environment,Mechanism,pubmed_247
Visual features ranging from simple intensity or oriented edges to more complex information identified automatically about objects in the environment may be translated in this manner into haptic stimulation of the finger,Mechanism,pubmed_247
Experiments using an initial prototype to trace a continuous straight edge,Method,pubmed_247
"have quantified the user 's ability to discriminate the angle of the edge ,",Findings,pubmed_247
"How can we correlate the neural activity in the human brain as it responds to typed words , with properties of these terms ( like 'edible ' , 'fits in hand ' ) ? In short , we want to find latent variables , that jointly explain both the brain activity , as well as the behavioral responses",Background,pubmed_248
This is one of many settings of the Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization ( CMTF ) problem,Background,pubmed_248
"Can we accelerate any CMTF solver , so that it runs within a few minutes instead of tens of hours to a day , while maintaining good accuracy ?",Purpose,pubmed_248
"We introduce TURBO-SMT , a meta-method",Mechanism,pubmed_248
capable of doing exactly that :,Purpose,pubmed_248
"it boosts the performance of any CMTF algorithm , by up to 200_ , along with an up to 65 fold increase in sparsity , with comparable accuracy to the baseline",Mechanism,pubmed_248
"We apply TURBO-SMT to BRAINQ , a dataset consisting of a ( nouns , brain voxels , human subjects ) tensor and a ( nouns , properties ) matrix , with coupling along the nouns dimension",Method,pubmed_248
Whole-genome assemblies of 19 placental mammals and two outgroup species were used,Mechanism,pubmed_25
to reconstruct the order and orientation of syntenic fragments in chromosomes of the eutherian ancestor and six other descendant ancestors leading to human,Purpose,pubmed_25
"For ancestral chromosome reconstructions ,",Purpose,pubmed_25
we developed an algorithm ( DESCHRAMBLER ) that probabilistically determines the adjacencies of syntenic fragments using chromosome-scale and fragmented genome assemblies,Mechanism,pubmed_25
"The reconstructed chromosomes of the eutherian , boreoeutherian , and euarchontoglires ancestor each included > 80 % of the entire length of the human genome , whereas reconstructed chromosomes of the most recent common ancestor of simians , catarrhini , great apes , and humans and chimpanzees included > 90 % of human genome sequence",Findings,pubmed_25
These high-coverage reconstructions permitted reliable identification of chromosomal rearrangements over _105 My of eutherian evolution,Findings,pubmed_25
"Orangutan was found to have eight chromosomes that were completely conserved in homologous sequence order and orientation with the eutherian ancestor , the largest number for any species",Findings,pubmed_25
"Ruminant artiodactyls had the highest frequency of intrachromosomal rearrangements , and interchromosomal rearrangements dominated in murid rodents",Findings,pubmed_25
"A total of 162 chromosomal breakpoints in evolution of the eutherian ancestral genome to the human genome were identified ; however , the rate of rearrangements was significantly lower ( 0",Findings,pubmed_25
"80/My ) during the first _60 My of eutherian evolution , then increased to greater than 2",Findings,pubmed_25
0/My along the five primate lineages studied,Findings,pubmed_25
Chemical transformations of silver nanoparticles ( Ag NPs ) and zinc oxide nanoparticles ( ZnO NPs ) during wastewater treatment and sludge treatment must be characterized to accurately assess the risks that these nanomaterials pose from land application of biosolids,Purpose,pubmed_253
"Here , X-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS ) and supporting characterization methods are used to determine the chemical speciation of Ag and Zn in sludge from a pilot wastewater treatment plant ( WWTP ) that had received PVP coated 50 nm Ag NPs and 30 nm ZnO NPs , dissolved metal ions , or no added metal",Method,pubmed_253
The effects of composting and lime and heat treatment on metal speciation in the resulting biosolids were also examined,Method,pubmed_253

"With the introduction of next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) technologies , we are facing an exponential increase in the amount of genomic sequence data",Background,pubmed_258
The success of all medical and genetic applications of next-generation sequencing critically depends on the existence of computational techniques that can process and analyze the enormous amount of sequence data quickly and accurately,Background,pubmed_258

Such a system would enable us to track medication cycles at home and provide valuable clinical feedback,Purpose,pubmed_259
Most of the relevant prior works involve supervised learning frameworks ( e,Background,pubmed_259
", Support Vector Machines )",Background,pubmed_259
"However , in-home monitoring provides only coarse ground truth information about symptom occurrences , making it very hard to adapt and train supervised learning classifiers for symptom detection",Background,pubmed_259
We address this challenge by formulating symptom detection under incomplete ground truth information as a multiple instance learning ( MIL ) problem,Mechanism,pubmed_259
"MIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that does not require exact instances of symptom occurrences for training ; rather , it learns from approximate time intervals within which a symptom might or might not have occurred on a given day",Mechanism,pubmed_259
"Once trained , the MIL detector was able to spot symptom-prone time windows on other days and approximately localize the symptom instances",Mechanism,pubmed_259
"We monitored two Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patients , each for four days with a set of five triaxial accelerometers and utilized a MIL algorithm based on axis parallel rectangle ( APR ) fitting in the feature space",Method,pubmed_259
"In this paper , we present a magnetically actuated multimodal drug release mechanism using a tetherless soft capsule endoscope",Mechanism,pubmed_260
for the treatment of gastric disease,Purpose,pubmed_260
"Because the designed capsule has a drug chamber between both magnetic heads , if it is compressed by the external magnetic field , the capsule could release a drug in a specific position locally",Mechanism,pubmed_260
The capsule is designed to release a drug in two modes according to the situation,Mechanism,pubmed_260
"In the first mode , a small amount of drug is continuously released by a series of pulse type magnetic field ( 0",Mechanism,pubmed_260
01-0,Mechanism,pubmed_260
03 T ),Mechanism,pubmed_260
The experimental results,Method,pubmed_260
show that the drug release can be controlled by the frequency of the external magnetic pulse,Findings,pubmed_260
"In the second mode , about 800 mm ( 3 ) of drug is released by the external magnetic field of 0",Mechanism,pubmed_260
"07 T , which induces a stronger magnetic attraction than the critical force for capsule 's collapsing",Mechanism,pubmed_260
"As a result , a polymeric coating is formed around the capsule",Mechanism,pubmed_260
The coated area is dependent on the drug viscosity,Mechanism,pubmed_260
This paper presents simulations and various experiments,Method,pubmed_260
to evaluate the magnetically actuated multimodal drug release capability,Findings,pubmed_260
Recognizing facial action units ( AUs ) is important for situation analysis and automated video annotation,Background,pubmed_261
Previous work has emphasized face tracking and registration and the choice of features classifiers,Background,pubmed_261
Relatively neglected is the effect of imbalanced data for action unit detection,Background,pubmed_261
"While the machine learning community has become aware of the problem of skewed data for training classifiers , little attention has been paid to how skew may bias performance metrics",Purpose,pubmed_261
"To address this question ,",Purpose,pubmed_261
"we conducted experiments using both simulated classifiers and three major databases that differ in size , type of FACS coding , and degree of skew",Method,pubmed_261
"We evaluated influence of skew on both threshold metrics ( Accuracy , F-score , Cohen 's kappa , and Krippendorf 's alpha ) and rank metrics ( area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve and precision-recall curve )",Method,pubmed_261
"With exception of area under the ROC curve , all were attenuated by skewed distributions , in many cases , dramatically so",Findings,pubmed_261
"While ROC was unaffected by skew , precision-recall curves suggest that ROC may mask poor performance",Findings,pubmed_261
Our findings suggest that skew is a critical factor in evaluating performance metrics,Background,pubmed_261
"We propose a parameter server system for distributed ML , which follows a Stale Synchronous Parallel ( SSP ) model of computation that",Mechanism,pubmed_262
"maximizes the time computational workers spend doing useful work on ML algorithms , while still providing correctness guarantees",Purpose,pubmed_262
"The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model 's values ( parameters and variables ) , and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older , stale versions of these values from a local cache , instead of waiting to get them from a central storage",Mechanism,pubmed_262
"This significantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing , as opposed to waiting",Mechanism,pubmed_262
"Furthermore , the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values",Mechanism,pubmed_262
"We provide a proof of correctness under SSP , as well as empirical results",Method,pubmed_262
We propose a scalable approach,Mechanism,pubmed_263
for making inference about latent spaces of large networks,Purpose,pubmed_263
"With a succinct representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs , a parsimonious statistical model , and an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm , we are able to analyze real networks with over a million vertices and hundreds of latent roles on a single machine in a matter of hours , a setting that is out of reach for many existing methods",Mechanism,pubmed_263
When compared to the state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches,Method,pubmed_263
This paper introduces a new approach to prediction,Purpose,pubmed_264
by bringing together two different nonparametric ideas : distribution free inference and nonparametric smoothing,Mechanism,pubmed_264
"Specifically , we consider the problem of constructing nonparametric tolerance/prediction sets",Purpose,pubmed_264
We start from the general conformal prediction approach and we use a kernel density estimator as a measure of agreement between a sample point and the underlying distribution,Mechanism,pubmed_264
The resulting prediction set is shown to be closely related to plug-in density level sets with carefully chosen cut-off values,Mechanism,pubmed_264
"Under standard smoothness conditions , we get an asymptotic efficiency result that is near optimal for a wide range of function classes",Mechanism,pubmed_264
But the coverage is guaranteed whether or not the smoothness conditions hold and regardless of the sample size,Mechanism,pubmed_264
The performance of our method is investigated,Findings,pubmed_264

Bevel-tipped flexible needles can be robotically steered to reach clinical targets along curvilinear paths in 3D,Background,pubmed_265

"This paper presents the characterization and comparison of physiological tremor for pointing tasks in multiple environments , as a baseline for performance evaluation of microsurgical robotics",Purpose,pubmed_266
Previous studies have examined the characteristics of physiological tremor under laboratory settings as well as different operating conditions,Background,pubmed_266
"However , different test methods make the comparison of results across trials and conditions difficult",Background,pubmed_266
"Two vitroretinal microsurgeons were evaluated while performing a pointing task with no entry-point constraint , constrained by an artificial eye model , and constrained by a rabbit eye in vivo",Method,pubmed_266
"For the three respective conditions the 3D RMS positioning error was 144 _m , 258 _m , and 285 _m , and maximum 3D error was 349 _m , 647 _m , and 696 _m",Findings,pubmed_266
A spectral analysis was also performed,Method,pubmed_266
Investigated the relationship between change over time in severity of depression symptoms and facial expression,Purpose,pubmed_267
Depressed participants were followed over the course of treatment and video recorded during a series of clinical interviews,Method,pubmed_267
Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems,Method,pubmed_267
"Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units , and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity",Findings,pubmed_267
"For both systems , when symptom severity was high , participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt , smiled less , and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt",Findings,pubmed_267
These results are consistent with the `` social risk hypothesis '' of depression,Findings,pubmed_267
"According to this hypothesis , when symptoms are severe , depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection , scorn , and social exclusion",Background,pubmed_267
"As their symptoms fade , participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate",Background,pubmed_267
The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and produced the same pattern of depression effects,Findings,pubmed_267

G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are seven helical transmembrane proteins that function as signal transducers,Background,pubmed_272
They bind ligands in their extracellular and transmembrane regions and activate cognate G proteins at their intracellular surface at the other side of the membrane,Background,pubmed_272
The relay of allosteric communication between the ligand binding site and the distant G protein binding site is poorly understood,Background,pubmed_272

"We consider the problem of sparse variable selection in nonparametric additive models , with the prior knowledge of the structure among the covariates to encourage those variables within a group to be selected jointly",Purpose,pubmed_277
Previous works either study the group sparsity in the parametric setting ( e,Background,pubmed_277
", group lasso ) , or address the problem in the nonparametric setting without exploiting the structural information ( e",Background,pubmed_277

"In this paper , we present a new method , called group sparse additive models ( GroupSpAM ) , which can handle group sparsity in additive models",Mechanism,pubmed_277
We generalize the _1/_2 norm to Hilbert spaces as the sparsity-inducing penalty in GroupSpAM,Mechanism,pubmed_277

Semantic grounding is the process of relating meaning to symbols ( e,Background,pubmed_29

It is the foundation for creating a representational symbolic system such as language,Background,pubmed_29
"Semantic grounding for verb meaning is hypothesized to be achieved through two mechanisms : sensorimotor mapping , i",Purpose,pubmed_29
", directly encoding the sensorimotor experiences the verb describes , and verb-category mapping , i",Purpose,pubmed_29

These two mechanisms were investigated by examining neuronal-level spike ( i,Method,pubmed_29

"neuronal action potential ) activities from the motor , somatosensory and parietal areas in two human participants",Method,pubmed_29
"Motor and a portion of somatosensory neurons were found to be involved in primarily sensorimotor mapping , while parietal and some somatosensory neurons were found to be involved in both sensorimotor and verb-category mapping",Findings,pubmed_29
The time course of the spike activities and the selective tuning pattern of these neurons indicate that they belong to a large neural network used for semantic processing,Findings,pubmed_29

Cryo-electron tomography ( cryo-ET ) captures the 3Delectron density distribution of macromolecular complexes in close to native state,Background,pubmed_31
"With the rapid advance of cryo-ET acquisition technologies , it is possible to generate large numbers ( > 100000 ) of subtomograms , each containing a macromolecular complex",Background,pubmed_31
"Often , these subtomograms represent a heterogeneous sample due to variations in the structure and composition of a complex insitu form or because particles are a mixture of different complexes",Background,pubmed_31
In this case subtomograms must be classified,Background,pubmed_31

"The correctness specification is implicit , inferred from the non-preemptive behavior",Mechanism,pubmed_34
Let us consider sequences of calls that the program makes to an external interface,Mechanism,pubmed_34

Neuromechanical simulations have been used to study the spinal control of human locomotion which involves complex mechanical dynamics,Background,pubmed_41
"So far , most neuromechanical simulation studies have focused on demonstrating the capability of a proposed control model in generating normal walking",Background,pubmed_41
"As many of these models with competing control hypotheses can generate human-like normal walking behaviors , a more in-depth evaluation is required",Background,pubmed_41
"Here , we conduct the more in-depth evaluation on a spinal-reflex-based control model using five representative gait disturbances , ranging from electrical stimulation to mechanical perturbation at individual leg joints and at the whole body",Purpose,pubmed_41
The immediate changes in muscle activations of the model are compared to those of humans across different gait phases and disturbance magnitudes,Method,pubmed_41
Remarkably similar response trends for the majority of investigated muscles and experimental conditions reinforce the plausibility of the reflex circuits of the model,Findings,pubmed_41
"However , the model 's responses lack in amplitude",Findings,pubmed_41
for two experiments with whole body disturbances,Method,pubmed_41

"Event discovery aims to discover a temporal segment of interest , such as human behavior , actions or activities",Background,pubmed_5
Most approaches to event discovery within or between time series use supervised learning,Background,pubmed_5
"This becomes problematic when some relevant event labels are unknown , are difficult to detect , or not all possible combinations of events have been anticipated",Purpose,pubmed_5
"To overcome these problems , this paper explores Common Event Discovery ( CED ) , a new problem that aims to discover common events of variable-length segments in an unsupervised manner",Purpose,pubmed_5
"A potential solution to CED is searching over all possible pairs of segments , which would incur a prohibitive quartic cost",Background,pubmed_5
"In this paper , we propose an efficient branch-and-bound ( B & B ) framework that avoids exhaustive search while guaranteeing a globally optimal solution",Mechanism,pubmed_5
"To this end , we derive novel bounding functions for various commonality measures and provide extensions to multiple commonality discovery and accelerated search",Mechanism,pubmed_5
The B & B framework takes as input any multidimensional signal that can be quantified into histograms,Mechanism,pubmed_5

to identify a subset of LoF-intolerant genes containing the observed signal of associated de novo protein-truncating variants ( PTVs ) in neurodevelopmental disorders,Purpose,pubmed_50
"LoF-intolerant genes also carry a modest excess of inherited PTVs , although the strongest de novo-affected genes contribute little to this excess , thus suggesting that the excess of inherited risk resides in lower-penetrant genes",Findings,pubmed_50

Robust principal component analysis ( PCA ) is one of the most important dimension-reduction techniques for handling high-dimensional data with outliers,Background,pubmed_58
"However , most of the existing robust PCA presupposes that the mean of the data is zero and incorrectly utilizes the average of data as the optimal mean of robust PCA",Purpose,pubmed_58
"In fact , this assumption holds only for the squared [ Formula : see text ] nan traditional PCA",Purpose,pubmed_58
"In this letter , we equivalently reformulate the objective of conventional PCA and learn the optimal projection directions",Purpose,pubmed_58
by maximizing the sum of projected difference between each pair of instances based on [ Formula : see text ] nan,Mechanism,pubmed_58
The proposed method is robust to outliers and also invariant to rotation,Mechanism,pubmed_58
"More important , the reformulated objective not only automatically avoids the calculation of optimal mean and makes the assumption of centered data unnecessary , but also theoretically connects to the minimization of reconstruction error",Mechanism,pubmed_58
"To solve the proposed nonsmooth problem , we exploit an efficient optimization algorithm to soften the contributions from outliers by reweighting each data point iteratively",Mechanism,pubmed_58
We theoretically analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm,Mechanism,pubmed_58

"State estimation is the most critical capability for MAV ( Micro-Aerial Vehicle ) localization , autonomous obstacle avoidance , robust flight control and 3D environmental mapping",Background,pubmed_60
There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation : ( 1 ) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF ( Degree Of Freedom ) motion ; ( 2 ) it should be robust to intermittent GPS ( Global Positioning System ) ( even GPS-denied ) situations ; ( 3 ) it should work well both for low- and high-altitude flight,Background,pubmed_60
"In this paper , we present",Mechanism,pubmed_60
a state estimation technique,Purpose,pubmed_60
"by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry , GPS , barometric and IMU ( Inertial Measurement Unit ) measurements",Mechanism,pubmed_60
"The new estimation system has two main parts , a stochastic cloning EKF ( Extended Kalman Filter ) estimator that loosely",Mechanism,pubmed_60
"fuses both absolute state measurements ( GPS , barometer ) and the relative state measurements ( IMU , visual odometry )",Purpose,pubmed_60
", and is derived and discussed in detail",Mechanism,pubmed_60
A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed,Mechanism,pubmed_60
for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation,Purpose,pubmed_60
by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter,Mechanism,pubmed_60
"The odometry takes the EKF information ( IMU integral ) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching , and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation",Mechanism,pubmed_60

Quantifying differences or similarities in connectomes has been a challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks,Background,pubmed_63
Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single local connectome fingerprint,Mechanism,pubmed_63
that allows for a direct comparison between structural connectomes,Purpose,pubmed_63
"In four independently acquired data sets with repeated scans ( total N 0 213 ) ,",Method,pubmed_63
"we show that the local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual , allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that achieved 100 % accuracy across 17398 identification tests",Findings,pubmed_63
The estimated classification error was approximately one thousand times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns for repeat scans acquired within 3 months,Findings,pubmed_63
"The local connectome fingerprint also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a decreasing trend in self-similarity across time , whereas this change was not observed in the diffusivity measures",Findings,pubmed_63
"Moreover , the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic marker , revealing 12",Findings,pubmed_63

Clinical decision support tools ( DSTs ) are computational systems that aid healthcare decision-making,Background,pubmed_64
"While effective in labs , almost all these systems failed when they moved into clinical practice",Background,pubmed_64
Healthcare researchers speculated it is most likely due to a lack of user-centered HCI considerations in the design of these systems,Background,pubmed_64
This paper describes,Purpose,pubmed_64
a field study investigating how clinicians make a heart pump implant decision,Method,pubmed_64
with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into their work process,Purpose,pubmed_64
"Our findings reveal a lack of perceived need for and trust of machine intelligence , as well as many barriers to computer use at the point of clinical decision-making",Findings,pubmed_64
Death by suicide demonstrates profound personal suffering and societal failure,Background,pubmed_65
"While basic sciences provide the opportunity to understand biological markers related to suicide , computer science provides opportunities to understand suicide thought markers",Purpose,pubmed_65
"In this novel prospective , multimodal , multicenter , mixed demographic study , we used machine learning",Mechanism,pubmed_65
to measure and fuse two classes of suicidal thought markers : verbal and nonverbal,Purpose,pubmed_65
"Machine learning algorithms were used with the subjects ' words and vocal characteristics to classify 379 subjects recruited from two academic medical centers and a rural community hospital into one of three groups : suicidal , mentally ill but not suicidal , or controls",Method,pubmed_65
"By combining linguistic and acoustic characteristics , subjects could be classified into one of the three groups with up to 85 % accuracy",Findings,pubmed_65
How neural stem cells generate the correct number and type of differentiated neurons in appropriate places remains an important question,Background,pubmed_67
"Although nervous systems are diverse across phyla , in many taxa the larva forms an anterior concentration of serotonergic neurons , or apical organ",Background,pubmed_67
"The sea star embryo initially has a pan-neurogenic ectoderm , but the genetic mechanism that directs a subset of these cells to generate serotonergic neurons in a particular location is unresolved",Purpose,pubmed_67
We show that neurogenesis in sea star larvae begins with soxc-expressing multipotent progenitors,Findings,pubmed_67
"These give rise to restricted progenitors that express lhx2/9 soxc- and lhx2/9-expressing cells can undergo both asymmetric divisions , allowing for progression towards a particular neural fate , and symmetric proliferative divisions",Findings,pubmed_67
"We show that nested concentric domains of gene expression along the anterior-posterior ( AP ) axis ,",Findings,pubmed_67
which are observed in a great diversity of metazoans,Background,pubmed_67
", control neurogenesis in the sea star larva by promoting particular division modes and progression towards becoming a neuron",Findings,pubmed_67
This work explains how spatial patterning in the ectoderm controls progression of neurogenesis in addition to providing spatial cues for neuron location,Background,pubmed_67
A fundamental problem in comparative genomics is to compute the distance between two genomes in terms of its higher level organization ( given by genes or syntenic blocks ),Background,pubmed_68
"For two genomes without duplicate genes , we can easily define ( and almost always efficiently compute ) a variety of distance measures ,",Background,pubmed_68
but the problem is NP-hard under most models when genomes contain duplicate genes,Purpose,pubmed_68
"To tackle duplicate genes ,",Purpose,pubmed_68
"three formulations ( exemplar , maximum matching , and any matching ) have been proposed ,",Mechanism,pubmed_68
all of which aim to build a matching between homologous genes so as to minimize some distance measure,Purpose,pubmed_68
"Of the many distance measures , the breakpoint distance ( the number of nonconserved adjacencies ) was the first one to be studied and remains of significant interest because of its simplicity and model-free property",Background,pubmed_68
The three breakpoint distance problems corresponding to the three formulations have been widely studied,Background,pubmed_68
Although we provided last year a solution for the exemplar problem that runs very fast on full genomes,Background,pubmed_68
", computing optimal solutions for the other two problems has remained challenging",Purpose,pubmed_68
"In this article , we describe very fast , exact algorithms for these two problems",Mechanism,pubmed_68
"Our algorithms rely on a compact integer-linear program that we further simplify by developing an algorithm to remove variables , based on new results on the structure of adjacencies and matchings",Mechanism,pubmed_68
"Through extensive experiments using both simulations and biological data sets ,",Method,pubmed_68
we show that our algorithms run very fast ( in seconds ) on mammalian genomes and scale well beyond,Findings,pubmed_68
"We also apply these algorithms ( as well as the classic orthology tool MSOAR ) to create orthology assignment , then compare their quality in terms of both accuracy and coverage",Method,pubmed_68
"Over 100 genetic loci harbor schizophrenia-associated variants ,",Background,pubmed_69

Genome-wide association studies have discovered a large number of genetic variants associated with complex diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease,Background,pubmed_7
"However , the genetic background of such diseases is largely unknown due to the complex mechanisms underlying genetic effects on traits , as well as a small sample size ( e",Background,pubmed_7
", 1000 ) and a large number of genetic variants ( e",Background,pubmed_7
", 1 million )",Background,pubmed_7
"Fortunately , datasets that contain genotypes , transcripts , and phenotypes are becoming more readily available , creating new opportunities for detecting disease-associated genetic variants",Purpose,pubmed_7
"In this paper , we present a novel approach called `` Backward Three-way Association Mapping '' ( BTAM",Mechanism,pubmed_7
") for detecting three-way associations among genotypes , transcripts , and phenotypes",Purpose,pubmed_7
"Assuming that genotypes affect transcript levels , which in turn affect phenotypes , we first find transcripts associated with the phenotypes , and then find genotypes associated with the chosen transcripts",Mechanism,pubmed_7
"The backward ordering of association mappings allows us to avoid a large number of association testings between all genotypes and all transcripts , making it possible",Mechanism,pubmed_7
to identify three-way associations with a small computational cost,Purpose,pubmed_7
"In our simulation study ,",Method,pubmed_7
we demonstrate that BTAM significantly improves the statistical power over `` forward '' three-way association mapping that finds genotypes associated with both transcripts and phenotypes and genotype-phenotype association mapping,Findings,pubmed_7
"Furthermore , we apply BTAM on an Alzheimer 's disease dataset",Method,pubmed_7
Stable chronic functionality of intracortical probes is of utmost importance toward realizing clinical application of brain-machine interfaces,Background,pubmed_70
Sustained immune response from the brain tissue to the neural probes is one of the major challenges that hinder stable chronic functionality,Background,pubmed_70
"There is a growing body of evidence in the literature that highly compliant neural probes with sub-cellular dimensions may significantly reduce the foreign-body response , thereby enhancing long term stability of intracortical recordings",Background,pubmed_70
"Since the prevailing commercial probes are considerably larger than neurons and of high stiffness , new approaches are needed for developing miniature probes with high compliance",Purpose,pubmed_70
"In this paper , we present design , fabrication , and in vitro evaluation of ultra-miniature ( 2",Mechanism,pubmed_70

8___10 ( -6 ) _N/_m in the lateral directions ) neural probes and associated probe-encasing biodissolvable delivery needles toward addressing the aforementioned challenges,Mechanism,pubmed_70
The high compliance of the probes is obtained by micron-scale cross-section and meandered shape of the parylene-C insulated platinum wiring,Mechanism,pubmed_70
Finite-element analysis is performed to compare the strains within the tissue during micromotion when using the ultra-compliant meandered probes with that when using stiff silicon probes,Mechanism,pubmed_70
The standard batch microfabrication techniques are used for creating the probes,Mechanism,pubmed_70
A dissolvable delivery needle that encases the probe facilitates failure-free insertion and precise placement of the ultra-compliant probes,Mechanism,pubmed_70
"Upon completion of implantation , the needle gradually dissolves , leaving behind the ultra-compliant neural probe",Mechanism,pubmed_70
A spin-casting based micromolding approach is used for the fabrication of the needle,Mechanism,pubmed_70
To demonstrate the versatility of the process,Findings,pubmed_70
", needles from different biodissolvable materials , as well as two-dimensional needle arrays with different geometries and dimensions , are fabricated",Method,pubmed_70
"Further , needles incorporating anti-inflammatory drugs are created",Method,pubmed_70
to show the co-delivery potential of the needles,Findings,pubmed_70
An automated insertion device is developed for repeatable and precise implantation of needle-encased probes into brain tissue,Mechanism,pubmed_70
"Insertion of the needles without mechanical failure , and their subsequent dissolution are demonstrated",Findings,pubmed_70
"It is concluded that ultra-miniature , ultra-compliant probes and associated biodissolvable delivery needles can be successfully fabricated , and the use of the ultra-compliant meandered probes results in drastic reduction in strains imposed in the tissue as compared to stiff probes ,",Findings,pubmed_70
Automated machine-reading biocuration systems typically use sentence-by-sentence information extraction to construct meaning representations for use by curators,Background,pubmed_76
"This does not directly reflect the typical discourse structure used by scientists to construct an argument from the experimental data available within a article , and is therefore less likely to correspond to representations typically used in biomedical informatics systems ( let alone to the mental models that scientists have )",Background,pubmed_76
"In this study , we develop Natural Language Processing methods",Mechanism,pubmed_76
"to locate , extract , and classify the individual passages of text from articles ' Results sections that refer to experimental data",Purpose,pubmed_76
"In our domain of interest ( molecular biology studies of cancer signal transduction pathways ) , individual articles may contain as many as 30 small-scale individual experiments describing a variety of findings , upon which authors base their overall research conclusions",Mechanism,pubmed_76
"Our system automatically classifies discourse segments in these texts into seven categories ( fact , hypothesis , problem , goal , method , result , implication ) with an F-score of 0",Mechanism,pubmed_76
68,Mechanism,pubmed_76
"These segments describe the essential building blocks of scientific discourse to ( i ) provide context for each experiment , ( ii ) report experimental details and ( iii ) explain the data 's meaning in context",Mechanism,pubmed_76
"We evaluate our system on text passages from articles that were curated in molecular biology databases ( the Pathway Logic Datum repository , the Molecular Interaction MINT and INTACT databases ) linking individual experiments in articles to the type of assay used ( coprecipitation , phosphorylation , translocation etc",Method,pubmed_76

to examine three-junctions in mixed lipid bilayer membranes,Purpose,pubmed_77
These junctions are localized defect lines in which three bilayers merge in such a way that each bilayer shares one monolayer with one of the other two bilayers,Mechanism,pubmed_77
"The resulting local morphology is non-lamellar , resembling the threefold symmetric defect lines in inverse hexagonal phases , but it regularly occurs during membrane fission and fusion events",Mechanism,pubmed_77
"We realize a system of junctions by setting up a honeycomb lattice , which in its primitive cell contains two hexagons and four three-line junctions , permitting us to study their stability as well as their line tension",Mechanism,pubmed_77
"We specifically consider the effects of lipid composition and intrinsic curvature in binary mixtures , which contain a fraction of negatively curved lipids in a curvature-neutral background phase",Mechanism,pubmed_77
"Three-junction stability results from a competition between the junction and an open edge , which arises if one of the three bilayers detaches from the other two",Mechanism,pubmed_77

Aneuploidy and structural variations ( SVs ) generate cancer genomes containing a mixture of rearranged genomic segments with extensive somatic copy number alterations,Background,pubmed_80
"However , existing methods can identify either SVs or allele-specific copy number alterations but not both simultaneously , which provides a limited view of cancer genome structure",Purpose,pubmed_80
"Here , we introduce Weaver , an algorithm",Mechanism,pubmed_80
for the quantification and analysis of allele-specific copy numbers of SVs,Purpose,pubmed_80
Weaver uses a Markov random field to estimate joint probabilities of allele-specific copy numbers of SVs and their inter-connectivity based on paired-end whole-genome sequencing data,Mechanism,pubmed_80
Weaver also predicts the timing of SVs relative to chromosome amplifications,Mechanism,pubmed_80

Advances in fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) make it feasible to detect multiple copy-number changes in hundreds of cells of solid tumors,Background,pubmed_87

The evolution of subclones in tumors may be modeled by phylogenies,Background,pubmed_87
Tumors often harbor aneuploid or polyploid cell populations,Background,pubmed_87
Using a FISH probe to estimate changes in ploidy can guide the creation of trees that model changes in ploidy and individual gene copy-number variations,Purpose,pubmed_87
"We present FISHtrees 3 , which implements a ploidy-based tree building method based on mixed integer linear programming ( MILP )",Mechanism,pubmed_87
The ploidy-based modeling in FISHtrees includes a new formulation of the problem of merging trees for changes of a single gene into trees modeling changes in multiple genes and the ploidy,Mechanism,pubmed_87
"When multiple samples are collected from each patient , varying over time or tumor regions , it is useful to evaluate similarities in tumor progression among the samples",Mechanism,pubmed_87
"Therefore , we further implemented in FISHtrees 3 a new method to build consensus graphs for multiple samples",Mechanism,pubmed_87
We validate FISHtrees 3 on a simulated data and on FISH data from paired cases of cervical primary and metastatic tumors and on paired breast ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) and invasive ductal carcinoma ( IDC ),Method,pubmed_87
The recent proliferation of cryptomarkets and the associated emergence of a sub-field of research on the anonymous web have outpaced the development of an ethical consensus regarding research methods and dissemination amongst scholars working in this unique online space,Background,pubmed_88
"The peculiar characteristics of cryptomarket research , which often involves encryption , illegal activity , large-scale data collection , and geographical separation from research participants , challenge conventional ethical frameworks",Background,pubmed_88

"Within the last 20 years , there has been an increasing interest in the computer vision community in automated facial image analysis algorithms",Background,pubmed_90
"This has been driven by applications in animation , market research , autonomous-driving , surveillance , and facial editing among others",Background,pubmed_90
"To date , there exist several commercial packages for specific facial image analysis tasks such as facial expression recognition , facial attribute analysis or face tracking",Background,pubmed_90

The current study reveals how a given object such as rabbit is neurally encoded differently and identifiably depending on whether it is an agent ( `` the rabbit punches the monkey '' ) or a patient ( `` the monkey punches the rabbit '' ),Purpose,pubmed_92
Machine-learning classifiers were trained on functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data evoked by a set of short videos that conveyed agent-verb-patient propositions,Method,pubmed_92

"Despite the widespread popularity of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) for genetic mapping of complex traits ,",Background,pubmed_96
most existing GWAS methodologies are still limited to the use of static phenotypes measured at a single time point,Purpose,pubmed_96
"In this work , we propose a new method",Mechanism,pubmed_96
for association mapping,Purpose,pubmed_96
"To enable real-time , person-independent 3D registration from 2D video ,",Purpose,pubmed_97
we developed a 3D cascade regression approach in which facial landmarks remain invariant across pose over a range of approximately 60 degrees,Mechanism,pubmed_97
"From a single 2D image of a person 's face , a dense 3D shape is registered in real time for each frame",Mechanism,pubmed_97
The algorithm utilizes a fast cascade regression framework trained on high-resolution 3D face-scans of posed and spontaneous emotion expression,Mechanism,pubmed_97
"The algorithm first estimates the location of a dense set of markers and their visibility , then reconstructs face shapes by fitting a part-based 3D model",Mechanism,pubmed_97
"Because no assumptions are required about illumination or surface properties , the method can be applied to a wide range of imaging conditions that include 2D video and uncalibrated multi-view video",Background,pubmed_97
The method has been validated,Findings,pubmed_97
in a battery of experiments that evaluate its precision of 3D reconstruction and extension to multi-view reconstruction,Method,pubmed_97
"Experimental findings strongly support the validity of real-time , 3D registration and reconstruction from 2D video",Findings,pubmed_97
"The environment of a living cell is vastly different from that of an in vitro reaction system , an issue that presents great challenges to the use of in vitro models , or computer simulations based on them , for understanding biochemistry in vivo",Background,pubmed_99
"Virus capsids make an excellent model system for such questions because they typically have few distinct components , making them amenable to in vitro and modeling studies , yet their assembly can involve complex networks of possible reactions that can not be resolved in detail by any current experimental technology",Background,pubmed_99
"We previously fit kinetic simulation parameters to bulk in vitro assembly data to yield a close match between simulated and real data , and then used the simulations to study features of assembly that can not be monitored experimentally",Background,pubmed_99
The present work seeks to project how assembly in these simulations fit to in vitro data would be altered by,Purpose,pubmed_99
"computationally adding features of the cellular environment to the system , specifically the presence of nucleic acid about which many capsids assemble",Mechanism,pubmed_99
The major challenge of such work is computational : simulating fine-scale assembly pathways on the scale and in the parameter domains of real viruses is far too computationally costly to allow for explicit models of nucleic acid interaction,Mechanism,pubmed_99
"We bypass that limitation by applying analytical models of nucleic acid effects to adjust kinetic rate parameters learned from in vitro data to see how these adjustments , singly or in combination , might affect fine-scale assembly progress",Mechanism,pubmed_99
"The resulting simulations exhibit surprising behavioral complexity , with distinct effects often acting synergistically to drive efficient assembly and alter pathways relative to the in vitro model",Findings,pubmed_99
"Establishing quantitative bounds on the execution cost of programs is essential in many areas of computer science such as complexity analysis , compiler optimizations , security and privacy",Background,wos_cs_10
"Techniques based on program analysis , type systems and abstract interpretation are well-studied ,",Background,wos_cs_10
but methods for analyzing how the execution costs of two programs compare to each other have not received attention,Purpose,wos_cs_10
Naively combining the worst and best case execution costs of the two programs does not work well in many cases because such analysis forgets the similarities between the programs or the inputs,Purpose,wos_cs_10
"In this work , we propose a relational cost analysis technique",Mechanism,wos_cs_10
that is capable of establishing precise bounds on the difference in the execution cost of two programs,Purpose,wos_cs_10
by making use of relational properties of programs and inputs,Mechanism,wos_cs_10
"We develop Rel Cost , a refinement type and effect system",Mechanism,wos_cs_10
for a higher-order functional language with recursion and subtyping,Purpose,wos_cs_10
The key novelty of our technique is the combination of relational refinements with two modes of typing-relational typing for reasoning about similar computations/inputs and unary typing for reasoning about unrelated computations/inputs,Mechanism,wos_cs_10
This combination allows us to analyze the execution cost difference of two programs more precisely than a naive non-relational approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_10
We prove our type system sound,Findings,wos_cs_10
using a semantic model based on step-indexed unary and binary logical relations accounting for non-relational and relational reasoning principles with their respective costs,Method,wos_cs_10
We demonstrate the precision and generality of our technique,Findings,wos_cs_10
Our human-robot collaboration research aims to improve the fluency and efficiency of interactions between humans and robots when executing a set of tasks in a shared workspace,Purpose,wos_cs_101
"During human-robot collaboration , a robot and a user must often complete a disjoint set of tasks that use an overlapping set of objects , without using the same object simultaneously",Background,wos_cs_101
A key challenge is deciding what task the robot should perform next in order to facilitate fluent and efficient collaboration,Background,wos_cs_101
"Most prior work does so by first predicting the human 's intended goal , and then selecting actions given that goal",Background,wos_cs_101
"However , it is often difficult , and sometimes impossible , to infer the human 's exact goal in real time , and this serial predict-then-act method is not adaptive to changes in human goals",Background,wos_cs_101
"In this paper , we present a system",Mechanism,wos_cs_101
"for inferring a probability distribution over human goals , and producing assistance actions given that distribution in real time",Purpose,wos_cs_101
The aim is to minimize the disruption caused by the nature of human-robot shared workspace,Purpose,wos_cs_101
We extend recent work utilizing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes ( POMDPs ) for shared autonomy in order,Mechanism,wos_cs_101
to provide assistance without knowing the exact goal,Purpose,wos_cs_101
"We evaluate our system in a study with 28 participants , and",Method,wos_cs_101
We provide a novel incremental data association method to complement our previous work on acoustic structure from motion ( ASFM ),Mechanism,wos_cs_103
", which recovers 3D scene structure from multiple 2D sonar images , while at the same time localizing the sonar",Purpose,wos_cs_103
"Given point features extracted from multiple overlapping sonar images , our algorithm automatically finds the correspondences between the features",Mechanism,wos_cs_103
Our data association method uses information about the geometric correlations of the entire set of landmarks to reject spurious measurements or 0 positives that might otherwise have been accepted,Mechanism,wos_cs_103
"For each new sonar measurement , the algorithm uses a gating procedure to narrow the landmark match search space",Mechanism,wos_cs_103
"Using the pruned surviving candidate correspondences , we identify the correct hypothesis based on a posterior compatibility cost , penalizing for nan matches to avoid all measurements being declared new landmarks",Mechanism,wos_cs_103
"Unlike other methods , ASFM does not require any planar scene assumptions and uses constraints from more than two images to increase accuracy in both mapping and localization",Mechanism,wos_cs_103
We evaluate our algorithm in simulation and,Method,wos_cs_103
demonstrate successful data association results,Findings,wos_cs_103
"Despite significant progress in GPS-denied autonomous flight , long-distance traversals ( > 100 km ) in the absence of GPS remain elusive",Purpose,wos_cs_105
This paper demonstrates a method capable,Mechanism,wos_cs_105
of accurately estimating the aircraft state over a 218 km flight,Purpose,wos_cs_105
"with a final position error of 27 m , 0",Mechanism,wos_cs_105
012\ % of the distance traveled,Mechanism,wos_cs_105
Our technique efficiently captures the full state dynamics of the air vehicle with semi-intermittent global corrections using LIDAR measurements matched against an a priori Digital Elevation Model ( DEM ),Mechanism,wos_cs_105
"Using an error-state Kalman filter with IMU bias estimation , we are able to maintain a high-certainty state estimate , reducing the computation time to search over a global elevation map",Mechanism,wos_cs_105
A sub region of the DEM is scanned with the latest LIDAR projection providing a correlation map of landscape symmetry,Mechanism,wos_cs_105
The optimal position is extracted from the correlation map to produce a position correction that is applied to the state estimate in the filter,Mechanism,wos_cs_105
This method provides a GPS-denied state estimate for long range drift-free navigation,Mechanism,wos_cs_105
"We demonstrate this method on two flight data sets from a full-sized helicopter ,",Method,wos_cs_105
"As robots aspire for long-term autonomous operations in complex dynamic environments , the ability to reliably take mission-critical decisions in ambiguous situations becomes critical",Background,wos_cs_106
This motivates the need to build systems that have situational awareness to assess how qualified they are at that moment to make a decision,Purpose,wos_cs_106
We call this self-evaluating capability as introspection,Purpose,wos_cs_106
"In this paper , we take a small step in this direction and",Purpose,wos_cs_106
propose a generic framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_106
for introspective behavior in perception systems,Purpose,wos_cs_106
"Our goal is to learn a model to reliably predict failures in a given system , with respect to a task , directly from input sensor data",Purpose,wos_cs_106
We present this in the context of vision-based autonomous MAV flight in outdoor natural environments,Method,wos_cs_106
The design of legged robots is often inspired by animals evolved to excel at different tasks,Background,wos_cs_107
"However , while mimicking morphological features seen in nature can be very powerful , robots may need to perform motor tasks that their living counterparts do not",Background,wos_cs_107
"In the absence of designs that can be mimicked , an alternative is to resort to mathematical models that allow the relationship between a robot 's form and function to be explored",Background,wos_cs_107
"In this paper , we propose such a model",Mechanism,wos_cs_107
to co-design the motion and leg configurations of a robot,Purpose,wos_cs_107
such that a measure of performance is optimized,Mechanism,wos_cs_107
The framework begins by planning trajectories for a simplified model consisting of the center of mass and feet,Mechanism,wos_cs_107
The framework then optimizes the length of each leg link while solving for associated full-body motions,Mechanism,wos_cs_107
We relax parametric inference to a non parametric representation towards more general solutions on factor graphs,Purpose,wos_cs_108
We use the Bayes tree factorization,Mechanism,wos_cs_108
to maximally exploit structure in the joint posterior,Purpose,wos_cs_108
thereby minimizing computation,Mechanism,wos_cs_108
We use kernel density estimation,Mechanism,wos_cs_108
"to represent a wider class of constraint beliefs ,",Purpose,wos_cs_108
which naturally encapsulates multi-hypothesis and non-Gaussian inference,Mechanism,wos_cs_108
"A variety of new uncertainty models can now be directly applied in the factor graph , and have the solver recover a potentially multi modal posterior",Mechanism,wos_cs_108
"For example , data association for loop closure proposals can be incorporated at inference time without further modifications to the factor graph",Mechanism,wos_cs_108
"Our implementation of the presented algorithm is written entirely in the Julia language , exploiting high performance parallel computing",Mechanism,wos_cs_108
This article presents a resource analysis system for OCaml programs,Purpose,wos_cs_11
The system automatically derives worst-case resource bounds for higher-order polymorphic programs with user-defined inductive types,Mechanism,wos_cs_11
"The technique is parametric in the resource and can derive bounds for time , memory allocations and energy usage",Mechanism,wos_cs_11
The derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials which are functions of different size parameters that depend on the standard OCaml types,Mechanism,wos_cs_11
Bound inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear optimization problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver,Mechanism,wos_cs_11
"Technically , the analysis system is based on a novel multivariate automatic amortized resource analysis ( AARA )",Mechanism,wos_cs_11
It builds on existing work on linear AARA for higher-order programs with user-defined inductive types and on multivariate AARA for first-order programs with built-in lists and binary trees,Mechanism,wos_cs_11
"This is the first amortized analysis , that automatically derives polynomial bounds for higher-order functions and polynomial bounds that depend on user-defined inductive types",Background,wos_cs_11
"Moreover , the analysis handles a limited form of side effects and even outperforms the linear bound inference of previous systems",Mechanism,wos_cs_11
"At the same time , it preserves the expressivity and efficiency of existing AARA techniques",Mechanism,wos_cs_11
The practicality of the analysis system is,Findings,wos_cs_11
demonstrated with an implementation and integration with Inria 's OCaml compiler,Method,wos_cs_11
"The implementation is used to automatically derive resource bounds for 411 functions and 6018 lines of code derived from OCaml libraries , the CompCert compiler , and implementations of textbook algorithms",Method,wos_cs_11
"In a case study ,",Method,wos_cs_11
"We present POMP ( Pareto Optimal Motion Planner ) , an anytime algorithm",Mechanism,wos_cs_111
for geometric path planning on roadmaps,Purpose,wos_cs_111
"For robots with several degrees of freedom , collision checks are computationally expensive and often dominate planning time",Background,wos_cs_111
Our goal is to minimize the number of collision checks for obtaining the first feasible path and successively shorter feasible paths,Purpose,wos_cs_111
"We assume that the roadmaps we search over are embedded in a continuous ambient space , where nearby points tend to share the same collision state",Mechanism,wos_cs_111
This enables us to formulate a probabilistic model that computes the probability of unevaluated configurations being collision-free,Mechanism,wos_cs_111
We update the model over time as more checks are performed,Mechanism,wos_cs_111
This model lets us define a weighting function for roadmap edges that is related to the probability of the edge being in collision,Mechanism,wos_cs_111
"Our approach is to trade off between these two weights , gradually prioritizing edge length over collision likelihood",Mechanism,wos_cs_111
"We also show that this tradeoff is approximately equivalent to minimizing the expected path length , with a penalty of being in collision",Mechanism,wos_cs_111
Our experiments,Method,wos_cs_111
We propose a submap-based technique,Mechanism,wos_cs_112
for mapping of underwater structures with complex geometries,Purpose,wos_cs_112
"Our approach relies on the use of probabilistic volumetric techniques to create submaps from multibeam sonar scans , as these offer increased outlier robustness",Mechanism,wos_cs_112
Special attention is paid to the problem of denoising/enhancing sonar data,Mechanism,wos_cs_112
Pairwise submap alignment constraints are used in a factor graph framework to correct for navigation drift and improve map accuracy,Mechanism,wos_cs_112
We provide experimental,Method,wos_cs_112

"Inertial reorientation of airborne articulated bodies has been an active area of research in the robotics community , as this behavior can help guide dynamic robots to a safe landing with minimal damage",Background,wos_cs_113
"The main objective of this work is emulating the aggressive and large angle correction maneuvers , like somersaults , that are performed by human divers",Purpose,wos_cs_113
"To this end , a planar three link robot , called DiverBot , is proposed",Mechanism,wos_cs_113
"By considering a gravity-free scenario , a local connection is obtained between joint angles and the body orientation , resulting in a reduction in the system dynamics",Mechanism,wos_cs_113
An optimal control policy applied on this reduced configuration space yielded diving maneuvers that are dynamically feasible,Mechanism,wos_cs_113
Numerical results,Method,wos_cs_113
We present a long-range visual signal detection system,Mechanism,wos_cs_115
that is suitable for an unmanned aerial vehicle to find an optical signal released at a desired landing site for the purposes of cargo delivery or rescue situations where radio signals or other communication systems are not available or the wind conditions at the landing site need to be signaled,Purpose,wos_cs_115
The challenge here is to have a signal and detection system that works from long range ( > 1000m ) amongst ground clutter during various seasonal conditions on passive imagery,Background,wos_cs_115
"We use a smoke-grenade as a ground signal , which has the advantageous properties of being easy to carry by ground crews because of its light weight and small size , but when released has a long visual signaling range",Mechanism,wos_cs_115
We employ a camera system on the UAV with a visual texture feature extraction approach in a machine learning framework to classify image patches as `signal ' or `background ',Mechanism,wos_cs_115
"We study conventional approaches and develop a visual feature descriptor that can better differentiate the appearance of the visual signal under varying conditions and , when used to train a random-forest classifier ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_115
outperforms commonly used feature descriptors,Findings,wos_cs_115
"The system was rigorously and quantitatively evaluated on data collected from a camera mounted on a helicopter and flown towards a plume of signal smoke over a variety of seasons , ground conditions , weather conditions , and environments",Method,wos_cs_115
Our system was capable of detecting the smoke cloud with both precision and recall rates greater than 0,Findings,wos_cs_115
95 from ranges between 1000m and 1500m,Findings,wos_cs_115
"Further , we develop a method",Mechanism,wos_cs_115
to estimate wind orientation and approximate wind strength,Purpose,wos_cs_115
by assessing the shape of the smoke signal,Mechanism,wos_cs_115
"In a hierarchical motion planning system for urban autonomous driving , it is a common practice to separate tactical reasoning from the lower-level trajectory planning",Background,wos_cs_116
"This separation makes it difficult to achieve robust maneuver-based tactical reasoning , which is intrinsically linked to trajectory planning",Purpose,wos_cs_116
"We therefore propose a planning method that automatically discovers tactical maneuver patterns , and fuses pattern reasoning and sampling-based trajectory planning",Mechanism,wos_cs_116
We consider the problem of generating dynamically feasible and safe plans for teams of aerial robots ( quadrotors ) while holding a fixed relative formation as well as transitioning between a sequence of formations,Purpose,wos_cs_117
"We extend the existing assignment and planning approaches for quadrotor teams to find minimal-time trajectories to enable team transition between non-rest initial and ending states while ensuring dynamic feasibility with respect to predefined kinematic , dynamic , and collision constraints",Mechanism,wos_cs_117
This work also presents a method for safe splitting and merging of robot formations according to input specification,Mechanism,wos_cs_117
The proposed methodology is capable of generating dynamically feasible and safe plans for teams of quadrotors in real time,Mechanism,wos_cs_117
We validate the performance of the proposed approach,Findings,wos_cs_117
"In many multi-robot applications such as target search , environmental monitoring and reconnaissance , the multi-robot system operates semi-autonomously , but under the supervision of a remote human who monitors task progress",Background,wos_cs_119
"In these applications , each robot collects a large amount of task-specific data that must be sent to the human periodically to keep the human aware of task progress",Background,wos_cs_119
"It is often the case that the human-robot communication links are extremely bandwidth constrained and/or have significantly higher latency than inter-robot communication links , so it is impossible for all robots to send their task-specific data together",Background,wos_cs_119
"Thus , only a subset of robots , which we call the knowledge leaders , can send their data at a time",Background,wos_cs_119
"In this paper , we study the knowledge leader selection problem , where the goal is to select a subset of robots with a given cardinality that transmits the most informative task-specific data for the human",Purpose,wos_cs_119
We prove that the knowledge leader selection is a submodular function maximization problem under explicit conditions,Findings,wos_cs_119
and present a novel distributed submodular optimization algorithm that has the same approximation guarantees as the centralized greedy algorithm,Mechanism,wos_cs_119
The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated,Findings,wos_cs_119
Formal constructive type theory has proved to be an effective language for mechanized proof,Background,wos_cs_12
"By avoiding non-constructive principles , such as the law of the excluded middle , type theory admits sharper proofs and broader interpretations of results",Background,wos_cs_12
"From a computer science perspective , interest in type theory arises from its applications to programming languages",Background,wos_cs_12
Standard constructive type theories used in mechanization admit computational interpretations based on meta-mathematical normalization theorems,Background,wos_cs_12
These proofs are notoriously brittle ; any change to the theory potentially invalidates its computational meaning,Background,wos_cs_12
"As a case in point , Voevodsky 's univalence axiom raises questions about the computational meaning of proofs",Background,wos_cs_12
We consider the question : Can higher-dimensional type theory be construed as a programming language ? We answer this question affirmatively,Purpose,wos_cs_12
"by providing a direct , deterministic operational interpretation for a representative higher-dimensional dependent type theory with higher inductive types and an instance of univalence",Mechanism,wos_cs_12
"Rather than being a formal type theory defined by rules , it is instead a computational type theory in the sense of Martin-Lof 's meaning explanations and of the NuPRL semantics",Mechanism,wos_cs_12
The definition of the type theory starts with programs ; types are specifications of program behavior,Mechanism,wos_cs_12

the,,wos_cs_120
proposed,,wos_cs_120
approach,,wos_cs_120
"Planning in CPSs requires temporal reasoning to handle the dynamics of the environment , including human behavior , as well as temporal constraints on system goals and durations of actions that systems and human actors may take",Background,wos_cs_121
The discrete abstraction of time in a state space planning should have a time sampling parameter value that satisfies some relation to achieve a certain precision,Background,wos_cs_121
"In particular , the sampling period should be small enough to allow the dynamics of the problem domain to be modeled with sufficient precision",Background,wos_cs_121
"Meanwhile , in many cases , events in the far future ( relative to the sampling period ) may be relevant to the decision making earlier in the planning timeline ; therefore , a longer planning look-ahead horizon can yield a closer-to optimal plan",Background,wos_cs_121
"Unfortunately , planning with a uniform fine-grained discrete abstraction of time and a long look-ahead horizon is typically computationally infeasible",Purpose,wos_cs_121
"In this paper , we propose a multiscale temporal planning approach formulated as MDP planning",Mechanism,wos_cs_121
to preserve the required time fidelity of the problem domain and at the same time approximate a globally optimal plan,Purpose,wos_cs_121
We illustrate our approach,Findings,wos_cs_121
Modern frameworks are required to be extendable as well as secure,Background,wos_cs_126
"However , these two qualities are often at odds",Purpose,wos_cs_126
"In this poster we describe an approach that uses a combination of static analysis and run-time management , based on software architecture models ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_126
that can improve security while maintaining framework extendability,Purpose,wos_cs_126
We implement a prototype of the approach for the Android platform,Method,wos_cs_126
"The Android platform is designed to support mutually un-trusted third-party apps , which run as isolated processes but may interact via platform-controlled mechanisms , called Intents",Background,wos_cs_128
"Interactions among third-party apps are intended and can contribute to a rich user experience , for example , the ability to share pictures from one app with another",Background,wos_cs_128
"The Android platform presents an interesting point in a design space of module systems that is biased toward isolation , extensibility , and untrusted contributions",Background,wos_cs_128
"The Intent mechanism essentially provides message channels among modules , in which the set of message types is extensible",Background,wos_cs_128
"However , the module system has design limitations including the lack of consistent mechanisms to document message types , very limited checking that a message conforms to its specifications , the inability to explicitly declare dependencies on other modules , and the lack of checks for backward compatibility as message types evolve over time",Background,wos_cs_128
"In order to understand the degree to which these design limitations result in real issues ,",Purpose,wos_cs_128
we studied a broad corpus of apps and cross-validated our results against app documentation and Android support forums,Method,wos_cs_128
Our findings suggest that design limitations do indeed cause development problems,Findings,wos_cs_128
Many have argued that the current try/catch mechanism for handling exceptions in Java is flawed,Background,wos_cs_129
A major complaint is that programmers often write minimal and low quality handlers,Purpose,wos_cs_129
We used the Boa tool,Method,wos_cs_129
to examine a large number of Java projects on GitHub to provide empirical evidence about how programmers currently deal with exceptions,Purpose,wos_cs_129
"We found that programmers handle exceptions locally in catch blocks much of the time , rather than propagating by throwing an Exception",Findings,wos_cs_129
"Programmers make heavy use of actions like Log , Print , Return , or Throw in catch blocks , and also frequently copy code between handlers",Findings,wos_cs_129
We found bad practices like empty catch blocks or catching Exception are indeed widespread,Findings,wos_cs_129
"We discuss evidence that programmers may misjudge risk when catching Exception , and face a tension between handlers that directly address local program statement failure and handlers that consider the program-wide implications of an exception",Findings,wos_cs_129
The goal of this paper is,Purpose,wos_cs_13
to develop a form of functional arrays ( sequences,Mechanism,wos_cs_13
") that are as efficient as imperative arrays , can be used in parallel , and have well defined cost-semantics",Purpose,wos_cs_13
The key idea is to consider sequences with functional value semantics but nonfunctional cost semantics,Mechanism,wos_cs_13
"Because the value semantics is functional , `` updating { '' } a sequence returns a new sequence",Mechanism,wos_cs_13
We allow operations on `` older { '' } sequences ( called interior sequences ) to be more expensive than operations on the `` most recent { '' } sequences ( called leaf sequences ),Mechanism,wos_cs_13
We embed sequences in a language supporting fork-join parallelism,Mechanism,wos_cs_13
"Due to the parallelism , operations can be interleaved non-deterministically , and , in conjunction with the different cost for interior and leaf sequences , this can lead to non-deterministic costs for a program",Mechanism,wos_cs_13
Consequently the costs of programs can be difficult to analyze,Mechanism,wos_cs_13
The main result is the derivation of a deterministic cost dynamics which makes analyzing the costs easier,Mechanism,wos_cs_13
The theorems are not specific to sequences and can be applied to other data types with different costs for operating on interior and leaf versions,Background,wos_cs_13
"We present a wait-free concurrent implementation of sequences that requires constant work for accessing and updating leaf sequences , and logarithmic work for accessing and linear work for updating interior sequences",Mechanism,wos_cs_13
We sketch a proof of correctness for the sequence implementation,Method,wos_cs_13
Person-independent and pose-invariant estimation of eye-gaze is important for situation analysis and for automated video annotation,Purpose,wos_cs_132
"We propose a fast cascade regression based method that first estimates the location of a dense set of markers and their visibility , then reconstructs face shape by fitting a part-based 3D model",Mechanism,wos_cs_132
"Next , the reconstructed 3D shape is used to estimate a canonical view of the eyes for 3D gaze estimation",Mechanism,wos_cs_132
The model operates in a feature space that naturally encodes local ordinal properties of pixel intensities leading to photometric invariant estimation of gaze,Mechanism,wos_cs_132
"To evaluate the algorithm in comparison with alternative approaches , three publicly-available databases were used , Boston University Head Tracking , Multi-View Gaze and CAVE Gaze datasets",Method,wos_cs_132
"Massive , Open , Online Courses ( MOOCs ) have been promoted as a means to revolutionize access to education",Background,wos_cs_134
"In this paper , we describe experiences with MOOCs for Liberian students who are connected to the iLab technology hub",Purpose,wos_cs_134
"Massive online classes can benefit from peer interactions such as discussion , critique , or tutoring",Background,wos_cs_135
"However , to scaffold productive peer interactions , systems must be able to detect student behavior in interactions at scale , which is challenging when interactions occur over rich media like video",Purpose,wos_cs_135
This paper introduces an imprecise yet simple browser-based conversational turn detector for video conversations,Mechanism,wos_cs_135
Turns are detected without accessing video or audio data,Mechanism,wos_cs_135
We show how this turn detector can find dominance in video-based conversations,Purpose,wos_cs_135
"In a case study with 1027 students using Talkabout , a video-based discussion system for online classes ,",Method,wos_cs_135
"Although xMOOCs are not designed to directly engage students via social media platforms , some students in these courses join MOOC-associated Facebook groups",Background,wos_cs_137
This study explores the prevalence of Facebook groups associated with courses from MITx and HarvardX,Purpose,wos_cs_137
", the geographic distribution of students in such groups as compared to the courses at large , and the extent to which such groups are location and/or language homophilous",Method,wos_cs_137
"Results suggests that a non-trivial number of MOOC students engage in Facebook groups , that learners from a number of non-U",Findings,wos_cs_137
"locations are disproportionately likely to participate in such groups , and that the groups display both location and language homophily",Findings,wos_cs_137
Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) provide an effective learning platform with various high-quality educational materials accessible to learners from all over the world,Background,wos_cs_138
"However , current MOOCs lack personalized learning guidance and intelligent assessment for individuals",Background,wos_cs_138
"Though a few recent attempts have been made to trace students ' knowledge states by adapting the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing ( BKT ) model , they have largely ignored the rich structures and correlations among knowledge components ( KCs ) within a course",Purpose,wos_cs_138
This paper proposes to model both the hierarchical and the temporal properties of the knowledge states in order to improve the modeling accuracy,Mechanism,wos_cs_138
"Based on the content organization characteristics on the Coursera MOOC platform , we provide a well-defined KC model , and develop Multi-Grained-BKT and Historical-BKT to capture the above features effectively",Mechanism,wos_cs_138
Experiments on a Coursera course dataset,Method,wos_cs_138
We present online algorithms,Mechanism,wos_cs_145
for covering and packing problems with ( non-linear ) convex objectives,Purpose,wos_cs_145
"We consider the robust curve fitting problem , for both algebraic and Fourier ( trigonometric ) polynomials , in the presence of outliers",Purpose,wos_cs_146
"In particular , we study the model of Arora and Khot ( STOC 2002 ) , who were motivated by applications in computer vision",Mechanism,wos_cs_146
"In their model , the input data consists of ordered pairs ( x ( i ) , y ( i ) ) is an element of { [ } -1 , 1 ] x { [ } -1 , 1 ] , i 0 1 , 2 ,",Background,wos_cs_146
", N , and there is an unknown degree-d polynomial p such that for all but rho fraction of the i , we have vertical bar p ( x ( i ) ) - y ( i ) vertical bar < 0 delta",Background,wos_cs_146
"Unlike Arora-Khot , we also study the trigonometric setting , where the input is from T x { [ } -1 , 11 , where T is the unit circle",Mechanism,wos_cs_146
"In both scenarios , the i corresponding to errors are chosen randomly , and for such i the errors in the y ( i ) can be arbitrary",Mechanism,wos_cs_146
"The goal is to output a degree-d polynomial q such that parallel to p - q parallel to ( infinity ) is small ( for example , O ( delta ) )",Mechanism,wos_cs_146
Arora and Khot could achieve a polynomial-time algorithm only for rho 0 0,Mechanism,wos_cs_146
Daltrophe et al,Mechanism,wos_cs_146
observed that a simple median-based algorithm can correct errors if the desired accuracy delta is large enough,Mechanism,wos_cs_146
"( Larger delta makes the output guarantee easier to achieve , which seems to typically outweigh the weaker input promise",Mechanism,wos_cs_146
) We dramatically expand the range of parameters for which recovery of q is possible in polynomial time,Mechanism,wos_cs_146
"Linear independence testing is a fundamental information-theoretic and statistical problem that can be posed as follows : given n points \ { ( X ( i ) ; Y-i ) \ } ( n ) ( i=1 ) from a p + q dimensional multivariate distribution where X-i is an element of R-p and Y-i is an element of R-q , determine whether a ( T ) X and b ( T ) Y are uncorrelated for every a is an element of R-p , b is an element of R-q or not",Background,wos_cs_147
We give minimax lower bound for this problem,Purpose,wos_cs_147
"( when p + q , n - > infinity , ( p + q ) /n < 0 kappa < infinity , without sparsity assumptions )",Mechanism,wos_cs_147
"In summary , our results imply that n must be at least as large as root pq/parallel to Sigma ( XY ) parallel to ( 2 ) ( F ) for any procedure ( test ) to have non-trivial power , where Sigma ( XY ) is the cross- covariance matrix of X , Y",Findings,wos_cs_147
"We also provide evidence that the lower bound is tight ,",Findings,wos_cs_147
"Given `` who-trusts/distrusts-whom { '' } information , how can we propagate the trust and distrust ?",Purpose,wos_cs_149
"With the appearance of fraudsters in social network sites , the importance of trust prediction has increased",Background,wos_cs_149
Most such methods use only explicit and implicit trust information ( e,Background,wos_cs_149
", if Smith likes several of Johnson 's reviews , then Smith implicitly trusts Johnson ) , but they do not consider distrust",Background,wos_cs_149
"In this paper , we propose PIN-TRUST , a novel method",Mechanism,wos_cs_149
"to handle all three types of interaction information : explicit trust , implicit trust , and explicit distrust",Purpose,wos_cs_149
"The novelties of our method are the following : ( a ) it is carefully designed , to take into account positive , implicit , and negative information , ( b ) it is scalable ( i",Mechanism,wos_cs_149
", linear on the input size ) , ( c ) most importantly , it is effective and accurate",Mechanism,wos_cs_149
"Our extensive experiments with a real dataset , Epinions",Method,wos_cs_149
"corn data , of 100K nodes and 1M edges ,",Method,wos_cs_149
"Recent work in dense monocular 3D reconstruction relies on dense pixel correspondences and assumes brightness constancy and saliency , and thus are fundamentally unable to reconstruct low-textured or non-lambertian objects such as glass or metal",Background,wos_cs_15
Occlusion boundaries differ from texture in that each unique view generates a unique set of occlusions,Background,wos_cs_15
"By detecting and solving for the depths of occlusion boundaries ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_15
we show how dense reconstructions of challenging objects can be integrated with existing monocular reconstruction algorithms,Purpose,wos_cs_15
by compensating with an increasing number of unique views,Mechanism,wos_cs_15
In a sequence containing the Stanford Bunny ( 8,Method,wos_cs_15

"Change introduces conflict into software ecosystems : breaking changes may ripple through the ecosystem and trigger rework for users of a package , but often developers can invest additional effort or accept opportunity costs to alleviate or delay downstream costs",Background,wos_cs_152
"We performed a multiple case study of three software ecosystems with different tooling and philosophies toward change , Eclipse , R/CRAN , and Node",Method,wos_cs_152
"js/npm ,",Method,wos_cs_152
"to understand how developers make decisions about change and change-related costs and what practices , tooling , and policies are used",Purpose,wos_cs_152
We found that all three ecosystems differ substantially in their practices and expectations toward change and that those differences can be explained largely by different community values in each ecosystem,Findings,wos_cs_152
We explore online reinforcement learning techniques to find good policies to control the orientation of a mobile robot during social group conversations,Purpose,wos_cs_154
"In this scenario , we assume that the correct behavior for the robot should convey attentiveness to the focus of attention of the conversation",Method,wos_cs_154
"Thus , the robot should turn towards the speaker",Method,wos_cs_154
Our results,Findings,wos_cs_154
from tests in a simulated environment,Method,wos_cs_154
show that,Findings,wos_cs_154
a new state representation that we designed for this problem,Mechanism,wos_cs_154
can be used to find good policies for the robot,Purpose,wos_cs_154
We describe a method,Mechanism,wos_cs_156
"for low-cost awareness of characteristics of dense , moving crowds such as group formation , personal space approximation , and occlusion compensation for use in navigating through crowds",Purpose,wos_cs_156
It incorporates social expectations and is inspired by human perceptual processes,Mechanism,wos_cs_156
"The approach uses a single Kinect to cluster all moving objects into groups , applies a 2D polygon projection in obscured regions , and a group personal space modeled using asymmetric Gaussians in order to inhibit certain socially inappropriate robot paths",Mechanism,wos_cs_156
"This approach trades off detection of individual people for higher coverage and lower cost , while preserving high speed processing",Mechanism,wos_cs_156
A real-world evaluation of this approach,Method,wos_cs_156
Trajectory planning methods for on-road autonomous driving are commonly formulated to optimize a Single Objective calculated by accumulating Multiple Weighted Feature terms ( SOMWF ),Background,wos_cs_159
Such formulation typically suffers from the lack of planning tunability,Purpose,wos_cs_159
"Two main causes are the lack of physical intuition and relative feature prioritization due to the complexity of SOMWF , especially when the number of features is big",Purpose,wos_cs_159
"Proactive latency-aware adaptation is an approach for self-adaptive systems that improves over reactive adaptation by considering both the current and anticipated adaptation needs of the system , and taking into account the latency of adaptation tactics so that they can be started with the necessary lead time",Background,wos_cs_160
Making an adaptation decision with these characteristics requires solving an optimization problem to select the adaptation path that maximizes an objective function over a finite look-ahead horizon,Background,wos_cs_160
"Since this is a problem of selecting adaptation actions in the context of the probabilistic behavior of the environment , Markov decision processes ( MDP ) are a suitable approach",Background,wos_cs_160
"However , given all the possible interactions between the different and possibly concurrent adaptation tactics , the system , and the environment , constructing the MDP is a complex task",Background,wos_cs_160
"Probabilistic model checking can be used to deal with this problem since it takes as input a formal specification of the stochastic system , which is internally translated into an MDP , and solved",Background,wos_cs_160
One drawback of this solution is that the MDP has to be constructed every time an adaptation decision has to be made to incorporate the latest predictions of the environment behavior,Purpose,wos_cs_160
In this paper we present an approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_160
that eliminates that run-time overhead,Purpose,wos_cs_160
"by constructing most of the MDP offline , also using formal specification",Mechanism,wos_cs_160
"At run time , the adaptation decision is made by solving the MDP through stochastic dynamic programming , weaving in the stochastic environment model as the solution is computed",Mechanism,wos_cs_160
Our experimental,Method,wos_cs_160
results show that this approach reduces the adaptation decision time by an order of magnitude,Findings,wos_cs_160
"compared to the probabilistic model checking approach ,",Method,wos_cs_160
This paper assesses the potential cost-saving incentives for content distribution networks to shift traffic load among geographically distributed data centers in response to hourly variation in electricity prices,Purpose,wos_cs_161
"Such incentives are likely aligned with benefits to utilities and grid operators , which might take the form of peak-shaving or ancillary services",Background,wos_cs_161
"However , private cost savings are not strictly aligned with public benefits related to the avoidance of health and environmental damages from power plant emissions ,",Background,wos_cs_161
so we compare private cost minimization with a strategy that minimizes these externalities,Method,wos_cs_161
"Personal informatics systems are becoming increasing prevalent as their price , form , and ease of use improves",Background,wos_cs_162
"Though these systems offer great potential value to users , many systems are hampered by issues that limit their ability to foster engagement , and people often abandon use of these systems without garnering meaningful outcomes",Background,wos_cs_162
"While continued use of these systems is not necessary for all people , there is an opportunity to better support people working towards achievement-based goals",Background,wos_cs_162
"In this paper , we draw from the literature and our own prior Work to identify a number of problems that hinder engagement with achievement-based personal informatics systems-problems related to inadequate support for goal setting , misalignment of user and system goals , and the burden of system maintenance",Purpose,wos_cs_162
We then propose seven strategies for the design community to explore,Mechanism,wos_cs_162
for mitigating these problems,Purpose,wos_cs_162
Machine learning improves mobile user experience,Background,wos_cs_164
"Interestingly , envisioning apps with adaptive interfaces that reduce navigation and selection effort is not standard UX practice",Background,wos_cs_164
"When implementing an adaptive UI for our mobile transit app , we encountered a number of problems",Background,wos_cs_164
Our original design did not log necessary information nor did it induce users to provide good labels,Purpose,wos_cs_164
"On reflection , we realized UX designers should identify and refine UI adaptions when sketching wireframes",Purpose,wos_cs_164
"To advance on this insight ,",Purpose,wos_cs_164
we reviewed the interfaces of popular apps and,Method,wos_cs_164
extracted six design patterns where UI adaptation can improve in-app navigation,Findings,wos_cs_164
"Next , we designed an exemplar set of wireframes , illustrating how UX designers might annotate their interaction flows",Mechanism,wos_cs_164
"With the aim of better scaffolding discussion to improve learning in a MOOC context , this work investigates what kinds of discussion behaviors contribute to learning",Purpose,wos_cs_168
We explored whether engaging in higher-order thinking behaviors results in more learning than paying general or focused attention to course materials,Purpose,wos_cs_168
"In order to evaluate whether to attribute the effect to engagement in the associated behaviors versus persistent characteristics of the students ,",Purpose,wos_cs_168
we adopted two approaches,Method,wos_cs_168
"First , we used propensity score matching to pair students who exhibit a similar level of involvement in other course activities",Method,wos_cs_168
"Second , we explored individual variation in engagement in higher-order thinking behaviors across weeks",Method,wos_cs_168

Compressed sensing is a simple and efficient technique that has a number of applications in signal processing and machine learning,Background,wos_cs_17
In machine learning it provides answers to questions such as : `` under what conditions is the sparse representation of data efficient ? { '' } ; `` when is learning a large margin classifier directly on the compressed domain possible ? { '' } ; and `` why does a large margin classifier learn more effectively if the data is sparse ? { '' },Background,wos_cs_17

by leveraging compressed sensing from the learning perspective,Mechanism,wos_cs_17
in order to provide answers to the aforementioned questions,Purpose,wos_cs_17
"We show , for a full-rank signal , the high dimensional sparse representation of data is efficient because from the classifiers viewpoint such a representation is in fact a low dimensional problem",Mechanism,wos_cs_17

We address the problem of estimating core numbers of nodes by reading edges of a large graph stored in external memory,Purpose,wos_cs_172
The core number of a node is the highest k-core in which the node participates,Background,wos_cs_172
"Core numbers are useful in many graph mining tasks , especially ones that involve finding communities of nodes , influential spreaders and dense subgraphs",Background,wos_cs_172
Large graphs often do not fit on the memory of a single machine,Background,wos_cs_172
Existing external memory solutions do not give bounds on the required space,Background,wos_cs_172

Making effective problem selection decisions is a challenging Self-Regulated Learning skill,Background,wos_cs_174
Students need to learn effective problem-selection strategies but also develop the motivation to use them,Background,wos_cs_174
A mastery-approach orientation is generally associated with positive problem selection behaviors such as willingness to work on new materials,Background,wos_cs_174
We conducted a classroom experiment with 200 6th - 8th graders,Method,wos_cs_174

In this paper we study the effect of adaptive scaffolding to learning by teaching,Purpose,wos_cs_175
"We hypothesize that learning by teaching is facilitated if ( 1 ) students receive adaptive scaffolding on how to teach and how to prepare for teaching ( the metacognitive hypothesis ) , ( 2 ) students receive adaptive scaffolding on how to solve problems ( the cognitive hypothesis ) , or ( 3 ) both ( the hybrid hypothesis )",Purpose,wos_cs_175
"We conducted a classroom study to test these hypotheses in the context of learning to solve equations by teaching a synthetic peer , SimStudent",Method,wos_cs_175

"Ambiguity arises in requirements when a statement is unintentionally or otherwise incomplete , missing information , or when a word or phrase has more than one possible meaning",Background,wos_cs_179

We describe methodologies for two types of attacks,Mechanism,wos_cs_180
"The first is for black-box attacks , which consider an adversary who infers sensitive values with only oracle access to a model",Mechanism,wos_cs_180
The second methodology targets the white-box scenario where an adversary has some additional knowledge about the structure of a model,Mechanism,wos_cs_180
"For the restricted class of Boolean models and black-box attacks , we characterize model invertibility using the concept of influence from Boolean analysis in the noiseless case , and connect model invertibility with stable influence in the noisy case",Mechanism,wos_cs_180
"Interestingly , we also discovered an intriguing phenomenon , which we call `` invertibility interference , { '' } where a highly invertible model quickly becomes highly non-invertible by adding little noise",Findings,wos_cs_180

Anonymity online is important to people at times in their lives,Background,wos_cs_183
Anonymous communication applications such as Whisper and YikYak enable people to communicate with strangers anonymously through their smartphones,Background,wos_cs_183
We report results from semi-structured interviews with 18 users of these apps,Method,wos_cs_183
"The goal of our study was to identify why and how people use anonymous apps , their perceptions of their audience and interactions on the apps , and how these apps compare with other online social communities",Purpose,wos_cs_183

Large graph datasets have caused renewed interest for graph partitioning,Background,wos_cs_19
"However , existing well-studied graph partitioners often assume that vertices of the graph are always active during the computation , which may lead to time-varying skewness for traversal-style graph workloads , like Breadth First Search , since they only explore part of the graph in each superstep",Purpose,wos_cs_19
"Additionally , existing solutions do not consider what vertices each partition will have ; as a result , high-degree vertices may be concentrated into a few partitions , causing imbalance",Purpose,wos_cs_19

"Although there has been a considerable amount of research on automatic emotion recognition in adults , emotion recognition in children has been understudied",Purpose,wos_cs_193
"This problem is more challenging as children tend to fidget and move around more than adults , leading to more self-occlusions and non-frontal head poses",Purpose,wos_cs_193

"Cyber-attacks are cheap , easy to conduct and often pose little risk in terms of attribution , but their impact could be lasting",Background,wos_cs_197
The low attribution is because tracing cyber-attacks is primitive in the current network architecture,Background,wos_cs_197
"Moreover , even when attribution is known , the absence of enforcement provisions in international law makes cyber attacks tough to litigate , and hence attribution is hardly a deterrent",Background,wos_cs_197

Increasing proliferation of mobile and online social networking platforms have given us unprecedented opportunity to observe and study social interactions at a fine temporal scale,Background,wos_cs_2
A collection of all such social interactions among a group of individuals ( or agents ) observed over an interval of time is referred to as a temporally-detailed ( TD ) social network,Background,wos_cs_2

"An alternative and complimentary strategy , model parallelism , partitions the model parameters for non-shared parallel access and updates , and may periodically repartition the parameters to facilitate communication",Background,wos_cs_201
"Model parallelism is motivated by two challenges that data-parallelism does not usually address : ( 1 ) parameters may be dependent , thus naive concurrent updates can introduce errors that slow convergence or even cause algorithm failure ; ( 2 ) model parameters converge at different rates , thus a small subset of parameters can bottleneck ML algorithm completion",Background,wos_cs_201

Much robotics research has focused on intent-expressive ( legible ) motion,Background,wos_cs_212
"However , algorithms that can autonomously generate legible motion have implicitly made the strong assumption of an omniscient observer , with access to the robot 's configuration as it changes across time",Purpose,wos_cs_212
"In reality , human observers have a particular viewpoint , which biases the way they perceive the motion",Purpose,wos_cs_212
"In this work , we free robots from this assumption and introduce the notion of an observer with a specific point of view into legibility optimization",Mechanism,wos_cs_212
"In doing so , we account for two factors : ( 1 ) depth uncertainty induced by a particular viewpoint , and ( 2 ) occlusions along the motion , during which ( part of ) the robot is hidden behind some object",Mechanism,wos_cs_212

What is the right supervisory signal to train visual representations ?,Purpose,wos_cs_220
Current approaches in computer vision use category labels from datasets such as ImageNet to train ConvNets,Background,wos_cs_220
"However , in case of biological agents , visual representation learning does not require millions of semantic labels",Purpose,wos_cs_220
We argue that biological agents use physical interactions with the world to learn visual representations unlike current vision systems which just use passive observations ( images and videos downloaded from web ),Purpose,wos_cs_220
"For example , babies push objects , poke them , put them in their mouth and throw them to learn representations",Background,wos_cs_220

"While effective in labs , almost all these systems failed when they moved into clinical practice",Background,wos_cs_264
Healthcare researchers speculated it is most likely due to a lack of user-centered HCI considerations in the design of these systems,Background,wos_cs_264
This paper describes,Purpose,wos_cs_264
a field study,Method,wos_cs_264
investigating how clinicians make a heart pump implant decision with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into their work process,Purpose,wos_cs_264
"Our findings reveal a lack of perceived need for and trust of machine intelligence , as well as many barriers to computer use at the point of clinical decision-making",Findings,wos_cs_264

"We identify situations across patients ' healthcare trajectories when decision supports would help ,",Findings,wos_cs_264
There is a significant gap in the body of research on cross-device interfaces,Background,wos_cs_265
"Research has largely focused on enabling them technically , but when and how users want to use cross-device interfaces is not well understood",Purpose,wos_cs_265
This paper presents,Purpose,wos_cs_265
an exploratory user study,Method,wos_cs_265
"with XDBrowser , a cross-device web browser we are developing",Mechanism,wos_cs_265
to enable non-technical users to adapt existing single-device web interfaces for cross-device use while viewing them in the browser,Purpose,wos_cs_265
We demonstrate that an end-user customization tool like XDBrowser is a powerful means to conduct user-driven elicitation studies useful for understanding user preferences and design requirements for cross-device interfaces,Findings,wos_cs_265
Our study with 15 participants,Method,wos_cs_265
elicited 144 desirable multi-device designs for five popular web interfaces when using two mobile devices in parallel,Findings,wos_cs_265

Social media is an increasingly important part of modern life,Background,wos_cs_266
"We investigate the use of and usability of Twitter by blind users ,",Purpose,wos_cs_266
"via a combination of surveys of blind Twitter users , large-scale analysis of tweets from and Twitter profiles of blind and sighted users , and analysis of tweets containing embedded imagery",Method,wos_cs_266
"While Twitter has traditionally been thought of as the most accessible social media platform for blind users , Twitter 's increasing integration of image content and users ' diverse uses for images have presented emergent accessibility challenges",Background,wos_cs_266
"Our findings illuminate the importance of the ability to use social media for people who are blind , while also highlighting the many challenges such media currently present this user base , including difficulty in creating profiles , in awareness of available features and settings , in controlling revelations of one 's disability status , and in dealing with the increasing pervasiveness of image based content",Findings,wos_cs_266
We describe techniques,Mechanism,wos_cs_267
"that allow inexpensive , ultra-thin , battery-free Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags to be turned into simple paper input devices",Purpose,wos_cs_267
"We use sensing and signal processing techniques that determine how a tag is being manipulated by the user via an RFID reader and show how tags may be enhanced with a simple set of conductive traces that can be printed on paper , stencil-traced , or even hand-drawn",Mechanism,wos_cs_267
These traces modify the behavior of contiguous tags to serve as input devices,Mechanism,wos_cs_267
"Our techniques provide the capability to use off-the-shelf RFID tags to sense touch , cover , overlap of tags by conductive or dielectric ( insulating ) materials , and tag movement trajectories",Mechanism,wos_cs_267

We address the problem of segmenting a multi-dimensional time series into stationary blocks,Purpose,wos_cs_270
"by improving AutoSLEX { [ } 1 ] ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_270
which has been successfully used for this purpose,Background,wos_cs_270
AutoSLEX finds the best basis in a library of smoothed localized exponentials ( SLEX ) basis functions that are orthogonal and localized in both time and frequency,Background,wos_cs_270
"We introduce DynamicSLEX , a variant of AutoSLEX that relaxes the dyadic intervals constraint of AutoSLEX , allowing for more flexible segmentation while maintaining tractability",Mechanism,wos_cs_270
"Then , we introduce RandSLEX , which uses random projections to scale-up SLEX-based segmentation to high dimensional inputs and to establish a notion of strength of splitting points in the segmentation",Mechanism,wos_cs_270
We demonstrate the utility of the proposed improvements,Findings,wos_cs_270
"Current symbol-based dictionaries providing vocabulary support for persons with the language disorder , aphasia , are housed on smartphones or other portable devices",Background,wos_cs_271
"To employ the support on these external devices requires the user to divert their attention away from their conversation partner , to the neglect of conversation dynamics like eye contact or verbal inflection",Background,wos_cs_271
"A prior study investigated head-worn displays ( HWDs ) as an alternative form factor for supporting glanceable , unobtrusive , and always-available conversation support ,",Background,wos_cs_271
but it did not directly compare the HWD to a control condition,Purpose,wos_cs_271
"To address this limitation ,",Purpose,wos_cs_271
"we compared vocabulary support on a HWD to equivalent support on a smartphone in terms of overall experience , perceived focus , and conversational success",Method,wos_cs_271
"Lastly , we elicited critical discussion of how each device might be better designed for conversation support",Method,wos_cs_271
"Our work contributes ( 1 ) evidence that a HWD can support more efficient communication , ( 2 ) preliminary results that a HWD can provide a better overall experience using assistive vocabulary , and ( 3 ) a characterization of the design features persons with aphasia value in portable conversation support technologies",Findings,wos_cs_271

Our VizMap system uses computer vision and crowdsourcing,Mechanism,wos_cs_273
to collect this information and make it available non-visually,Purpose,wos_cs_273
VizMap starts with videos taken by on-site sighted volunteers and uses these to create a 3D spatial model,Mechanism,wos_cs_273
These video frames are semantically labeled by remote crowd workers with key visual information,Mechanism,wos_cs_273
"These semantic labels are located within and embedded into the reconstructed 3D model , forming a query-able spatial representation of the environment",Mechanism,wos_cs_273
"VizMap can then localize the user with a photo from their smartphone , and enable them to explore the visual elements that are nearby",Mechanism,wos_cs_273
We explore a range of example applications enabled by our reconstructed spatial representation,Method,wos_cs_273
"Playtesting , or using play to guide game design , gives designers feedback about whether their game is meeting their goals and the player 's expectations",Background,wos_cs_275

"novice game designers leveraged playtest methods and tools , employed playtesting and data collection methods appropriate for their goals , and effectively applied playtest data in iterative design",Findings,wos_cs_275
Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT deployments,Background,wos_cs_277
The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the cloud,Purpose,wos_cs_277
This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of today 's cloud-based IoT hub designs,Purpose,wos_cs_277
"We introduce differential refinement logic ( dRL ) , a logic with first-class support",Mechanism,wos_cs_279
"for refinement relations on hybrid systems ,",Purpose,wos_cs_279
and a proof calculus,Mechanism,wos_cs_279
for verifying such relations,Purpose,wos_cs_279
dRL simultaneously solves several seemingly different challenges common in theorem proving for hybrid systems :,Mechanism,wos_cs_279
1,Background,wos_cs_279
"When hybrid systems are complicated , it is useful to prove properties about simpler and related subsystems before tackling the system as a whole",Background,wos_cs_279
2,Background,wos_cs_279
Some models of hybrid systems can be implementation-specific,Background,wos_cs_279
"Verification can be aided by abstracting the system down to the core components necessary for safety , but only if the relations between the abstraction and the original system can be guaranteed",Background,wos_cs_279
3,Background,wos_cs_279
One approach to taming the complexities of hybrid systems is to start with a simplified version of the system and iteratively expand it,Background,wos_cs_279
"However , this approach can be costly , since every iteration has to be proved safe from scratch , unless refinement relations can be leveraged in the proof",Background,wos_cs_279
4,Background,wos_cs_279
"When proofs become large , it is difficult to maintain a modular or comprehensible proof structure",Background,wos_cs_279
"By using a refinement relation to arrange proofs hierarchically according to the structure of natural subsystems , we can increase the readability and modularity of the resulting proof",Mechanism,wos_cs_279
"dRL extends an existing specification and verification language for hybrid systems ( differential dynamic logic , dL ) by adding a refinement relation to directly compare hybrid systems",Mechanism,wos_cs_279
"This paper gives a syntax , semantics , and proof calculus for dRL",Purpose,wos_cs_279
We demonstrate its usefulness,Findings,wos_cs_279
with examples where using refinement,Method,wos_cs_279
Self-adaptive systems have the ability to adapt their behavior to dynamic operating conditions,Background,wos_cs_28
"In reaction to changes in the environment , these systems determine the appropriate corrective actions based in part on information about which action will have the best impact on the system",Background,wos_cs_28
"Existing models used to describe the impact of adaptations are either unable to capture the underlying uncertainty and variability of such dynamic environments , or are not compositional and described at a level of abstraction too low to scale in terms of specification effort required for non-trivial systems",Purpose,wos_cs_28
"In this paper , we address these shortcomings",Purpose,wos_cs_28
by describing an approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_28
to the specification of impact models,Purpose,wos_cs_28
"based on architectural system descriptions , which at the same time",Mechanism,wos_cs_28
allows us to represent both variability and uncertainty in the outcome of adaptations,Purpose,wos_cs_28
", hence improving the selection of the best corrective action",Mechanism,wos_cs_28
"The core of our approach is a language equipped with a formal semantics defined in terms of Discrete Time Markov Chains that enables us to describe both the impact of adaptation tactics , as well as the assumptions about the environment",Mechanism,wos_cs_28
"To validate our approach , we show how employing our language",Method,wos_cs_28
can improve the accuracy of predictions used for decision-making,Findings,wos_cs_28
"Everyday tools and objects often need to be customized for an unplanned use or adapted for specific user , such as adding a bigger pull to a zipper or a larger grip for a pen",Background,wos_cs_281
The advent of low-cost 3D printing offers the possibility to rapidly construct a wide range of such adaptations,Background,wos_cs_281
"However , while 3D printers are now affordable enough for even home use , the tools needed to design custom adaptations normally require skills that are beyond users with limited 3D modeling experience",Purpose,wos_cs_281
"In this paper , we describe Reprise-a design tool for specifying , generating , customizing and fitting adaptations onto existing household objects",Mechanism,wos_cs_281
Reprise allows users to express at a high level what type of action is applied to an object,Mechanism,wos_cs_281
"Based on this high level specification , Reprise automatically generates adaptations",Mechanism,wos_cs_281
"Users can use simple sliders to customize the adaptations to better suit their particular needs and preferences , such as increasing the tightness for gripping , enhancing torque for rotation , or making a larger base for stability",Mechanism,wos_cs_281
"Finally , Reprise provides a toolkit of fastening methods and support structures for fitting the adaptations onto existing objects",Mechanism,wos_cs_281
"To validate our approach , we used Reprise to replicate 15 existing adaptation examples , each of which represents a specific category in a design space distilled from an analysis of over 3000 cases found in the literature and online communities",Method,wos_cs_281
"Patients researching medical diagnoses , scientist exploring new fields of literature , and students learning about new domains are all faced with the challenge of capturing information they find for later use",Background,wos_cs_282
"However , saving information is challenging on mobile devices , where the small screen and font sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use",Background,wos_cs_282
"Furthermore , beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text on a mobile device , in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the user",Background,wos_cs_282
"In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster ,",Background,wos_cs_282
we introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context of saving information during complex reading and information exploration,Purpose,wos_cs_282
We embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes along with posthoc expandable context,Mechanism,wos_cs_282
to support identifying and saving information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices,Purpose,wos_cs_282
In a two part user study,Method,wos_cs_282
"The world is full of physical interfaces that are inaccessible to blind people , from microwaves and information kiosks to thermostats and checkout terminals",Background,wos_cs_285
"Blind people can not independently use such devices without at least first learning their layout , and usually only after labeling them with sighted assistance",Background,wos_cs_285
We introduce VizLens-an accessible mobile application and supporting backend,Mechanism,wos_cs_285
that can robustly and interactively help blind people use nearly any interface they encounter,Purpose,wos_cs_285
"VizLens users capture a photo of an inaccessible interface and send it to multiple crowd workers , who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface to make subsequent computer vision easier",Mechanism,wos_cs_285
"The VizLens application helps users recapture the interface in the field of the camera , and uses computer vision to interactively describe the part of the interface beneath their finger ( updating 8 times per second )",Mechanism,wos_cs_285
We show that VizLens provides accurate and usable real-time feedback,Findings,wos_cs_285
"in a study with 10 blind participants ,",Method,wos_cs_285
"and our crowdsourcing labeling workflow was fast ( 8 minutes ) , accurate ( 99",Findings,wos_cs_285
"7\ % ) , and cheap ( \ $ 1",Findings,wos_cs_285
15 ),Findings,wos_cs_285
"We then explore extensions of VizLens that allow it to ( i ) adapt to state changes in dynamic interfaces , ( ii ) combine crowd labeling with OCR technology to handle dynamic displays , and ( iii ) benefit from head-mounted cameras",Mechanism,wos_cs_285
VizLens robustly solves a long-standing challenge in accessibility,Findings,wos_cs_285
"by deeply integrating crowdsourcing and computer vision ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_285
"The recent advances in image captioning stimulate the research in generating natural language description for visual content , which can be widely applied in many applications such as assisting blind people",Background,wos_cs_287
Video description generation is a more complex task than image caption,Background,wos_cs_287
Most works of video description generation focus on visual information in the video,Background,wos_cs_287
"However , audio provides rich information for describing video contents as well",Purpose,wos_cs_287
"In this paper , we propose",Mechanism,wos_cs_287
to generate video descriptions in natural sentences,Purpose,wos_cs_287
using both audio and visual cues,Mechanism,wos_cs_287

An important feature of functional programs is that they are parallel by default,Background,wos_cs_29
"Implementing an efficient parallel functional language , however , is a major challenge , in part because the high rate of allocation and freeing associated with functional programs requires an efficient and scalable memory manager",Purpose,wos_cs_29
"In this paper , we present a technique",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
for parallel memory management for strict functional languages with nested parallelism,Purpose,wos_cs_29
"At the highest level of abstraction , the approach consists of a technique to organize memory as a hierarchy of heaps , and an algorithm for performing automatic memory reclamation by taking advantage of a disentanglement property of parallel functional programs",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
"More specifically , the idea is to assign to each parallel task its own heap in memory and organize the heaps in a hierarchy/tree that mirrors the hierarchy of tasks",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
"We present a nested-parallel calculus that specifies hierarchical heaps and prove in this calculus a disentanglement property , which prohibits a task from accessing objects allocated by another task that might execute in parallel",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
"Leveraging the disentanglement property , we present a garbage collection technique that can operate on any subtree in the memory hierarchy concurrently as other tasks ( and/or other collections ) proceed in parallel",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
We prove the safety of this collector,Findings,wos_cs_29
by formalizing it in the context of our parallel calculus,Method,wos_cs_29
"In addition , we describe how the proposed techniques can be implemented on modern shared-memory machines",Findings,wos_cs_29
"and present a prototype implementation as an extension to MLton , a high-performance compiler for the Standard ML language",Mechanism,wos_cs_29
"Micro-clones are small pieces of redundant code , such as repeated subexpressions or statements",Background,wos_cs_291
"In this paper , we establish the considerations and value toward automated detection and removal of micro-clones at scale",Purpose,wos_cs_291
We leverage the Boa software mining infrastructure,Mechanism,wos_cs_291
to detect micro-clones,Purpose,wos_cs_291
"in a data set containing 380125 Java repositories , and yield thousands of instances where redundant code may be safely removed",Mechanism,wos_cs_291
"By filtering our results to target popular Java projects on GitHub , we proceed to issue 43 pull requests that patch micro-clones",Mechanism,wos_cs_291
"In summary , 95\ % of our patches to active GitHub repositories are merged rapidly ( within 15 hours on average )",Findings,wos_cs_291
"Moreover , none of our patches were contested ; they either constituted a real flaw , or have not been considered due to repository inactivity",Findings,wos_cs_291
Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for practical large-scale equilibrium computation in imperfect-information games,Background,wos_cs_295
"However , imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood , and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known",Purpose,wos_cs_295
"We develop the first general , algorithm-agnostic , solution quality guarantees for Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions , when implemented in the original ( perfect-recall ) game",Mechanism,wos_cs_295
Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions for which any such results have been obtained,Mechanism,wos_cs_295
"Further , our analysis is tighter in two ways , each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound",Mechanism,wos_cs_295
"We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties , the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem , where the increase in our bound is the distance function",Mechanism,wos_cs_295
This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds,Mechanism,wos_cs_295
We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems,Mechanism,wos_cs_295
"If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction , the input forms a metric space , and this immediately yields a 2-approximation algorithm for abstraction",Mechanism,wos_cs_295
"Conversely , if this condition is not satisfied , we show that the input does not form a metric space",Mechanism,wos_cs_295
"Finally , we provide computational experiments to evaluate the practical usefulness of the abstraction techniques",Method,wos_cs_295
SwitchKV is a new key-value store system design that combines high-performance cache nodes with resource-constrained backend nodes,Mechanism,wos_cs_297
to provide load balancing in the face of unpredictable workload skew,Purpose,wos_cs_297
The cache nodes absorb the hottest queries so that no individual backend node is over-burdened,Mechanism,wos_cs_297
"Compared with previous designs , SwitchKV exploits SDN techniques and deeply optimized switch hardware",Mechanism,wos_cs_297
to enable efficient content-based routing,Purpose,wos_cs_297
"Programmable network switches keep track of cached keys and route requests to the appropriate nodes at line speed , based on keys encoded in packet headers",Mechanism,wos_cs_297
A new hybrid caching strategy keeps cache and switch forwarding rules updated with low overhead and ensures that system load is always well-balanced under rapidly changing workloads,Mechanism,wos_cs_297

"Multi-stage log-structured ( MSLS ) designs , such as LevelDB , RocksDB , HBase , and Cassandra , are a family of storage system designs that exploit the high sequential write speeds of hard disks and flash drives by using multiple append-only data structures",Background,wos_cs_298
As a first step,Mechanism,wos_cs_298

Motivation : Reconstructing regulatory networks from expression and interaction data is a major goal of systems biology,Background,wos_cs_30
"While much work has focused on trying to experimentally and computationally determine the set of transcription-factors ( TFs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) that regulate genes in these networks , relatively little work has focused on inferring the regulation of miRNAs by TFs",Background,wos_cs_30
Such regulation can play an important role in several biological processes including development and disease,Background,wos_cs_30
The main challenge for predicting such interactions is the very small positive training set currently available,Background,wos_cs_30
Another challenge is the fact that a large fraction of miRNAs are encoded within genes making it hard to determine the specific way in which they are regulated,Background,wos_cs_30
Results :,Findings,wos_cs_30
To enable genome wide predictions of TF-miRNA interactions,Purpose,wos_cs_30
", we extended semisupervised machine-learning approaches to integrate a large set of different types of data including sequence , expression , ChIP-seq and epigenetic data",Mechanism,wos_cs_30
"As we show , the methods we develop achieve good performance",Findings,wos_cs_30
"on both a labeled test set , and when analyzing general co-expression networks",Method,wos_cs_30
"We next analyze mRNA and miRNA cancer expression data ,",Method,wos_cs_30

"We present uberSpark ( uSpark ) , an innovative architecture",Mechanism,wos_cs_300
for compositional verification of security properties of extensible hypervisors written in C and Assembly,Purpose,wos_cs_300
uSpark comprises two key ideas : ( i ) endowing low-level system software with abstractions found in higher-level languages ( e,Mechanism,wos_cs_300
", objects , interfaces , function-call semantics for implementations of interfaces , access control on interfaces , concurrency and serialization ) , enforced using a combination of commodity hardware mechanisms and lightweight static analysis ; and ( ii ) interfacing with platform hardware by programming in Assembly using an idiomatic style ( called CASM ) that is verifiable via tools aimed at C , while retaining its performance and low-level access to hardware",Mechanism,wos_cs_300
"After verification , the C code is compiled using a certified compiler while the CASM code is translated into its corresponding Assembly instructions",Mechanism,wos_cs_300
"Collectively , these innovations enable compositional verification of security invariants without sacrificing performance",Mechanism,wos_cs_300
We validate uSpark,Findings,wos_cs_300
"by building and verifying security invariants of an existing open-source commodity x86 micro-hypervisor and several of its extensions ,",Method,wos_cs_300
"Human-chosen text passwords , today 's dominant form of authentication , are vulnerable to guessing attacks",Background,wos_cs_301
"Unfortunately , existing approaches for evaluating password strength by modeling adversarial password guessing are either inaccurate or orders of magnitude too large and too slow for real-time , client-side password checking",Purpose,wos_cs_301
We propose using artificial neural networks to model text passwords ' resistance to guessing attacks and explore how different architectures and training methods impact neural networks ' guessing effectiveness,Mechanism,wos_cs_301
"We show that neural networks can often guess passwords more effectively than state-of-the-art approaches , such as probabilistic context-free grammars and Markov models",Findings,wos_cs_301
We also show that our neural networks can be highly compressed-to as little as hundreds of kilobytes-without substantially worsening guessing effectiveness,Findings,wos_cs_301
"Building on these results , we implement in JavaScript the first principled client-side model of password guessing , which analyzes a password 's resistance to a guessing attack of arbitrary duration with sub-second latency",Mechanism,wos_cs_301
"Modern RDMA hardware offers the potential for exceptional performance ,",Background,wos_cs_302
but design choices including which RDMA operations to use and how to use them significantly affect observed performance,Purpose,wos_cs_302
This paper lays out guidelines that can be used by system designers,Mechanism,wos_cs_302
to navigate the RDMA design space,Purpose,wos_cs_302
Our guidelines emphasize paying attention to low-level details such as individual PCIe transactions and NIC architecture,Mechanism,wos_cs_302
We empirically demonstrate how these guidelines can be used to improve the performance of RDMA-based systems : we design a networked sequencer,Method,wos_cs_302
"that outperforms an existing design by 50x , and improve the CPU efficiency of a prior high-performance key-value store by 83\ %",Findings,wos_cs_302
Transcription makes speech accessible to deaf and hard of hearing people,Background,wos_cs_303
"This conversion of speech to text is still done manually by humans , despite high cost , because the quality of automated speech recognition ( ASR ) is still too low in real-world settings",Background,wos_cs_303
"Manual conversion can require more than 5 times the original audio time , which also introduces significant latency",Background,wos_cs_303
"Giving transcriptionists ASR output as a starting point seems like a reasonable approach to making humans more efficient and thereby reducing this cost , but the effectiveness of this approach is clearly related to the quality of the speech recognition output",Background,wos_cs_303
"At high error rates , fixing inaccurate speech recognition output may take longer than producing the transcription from scratch , and transcriptionists may not realize when transcription output is too inaccurate to be useful",Background,wos_cs_303
"In this paper , we empirically explore how the latency of transcriptions created by participants recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk vary based on the accuracy of speech recognition output",Purpose,wos_cs_303
We present results,Findings,wos_cs_303

Malware authors have been using websites to distribute their products as a way to evade spam filters and classic anti-virus engines,Background,wos_cs_306
"Yet there has been relatively little work in modeling the behaviors and temporal properties of websites , as most research focuses on detecting whether a website distributes malware",Purpose,wos_cs_306
In this paper we ask : How does web-based malware spread ?,Purpose,wos_cs_306
We conduct an extensive study and follow a website-centric and user-centric point of view,Method,wos_cs_306
"We collect data from four online databases , including Symantec 's WINE Project , for a total of more than 600K malicious URLs and over 500K users",Method,wos_cs_306
"First , we find that legitimate but compromised websites constitute 33",Findings,wos_cs_306
1\ % of the malicious websites in our dataset,Findings,wos_cs_306
"In order to conduct this study , we develop a classifier to distinguish between compromised vs",Mechanism,wos_cs_306
malicious websites,Mechanism,wos_cs_306
with an accuracy of 95,Findings,wos_cs_306
3\ %,Findings,wos_cs_306
", which could be of interest to studies on website profiling",Background,wos_cs_306
"Second , we find that malicious URLs can be surprisingly long-lived , with 10\ % of malicious sites staying active for three months or more",Findings,wos_cs_306
"Third , we observe that a significant number of URLs exhibit the same temporal pattern that suggests a flush-crowd behavior , inflicting most of their damage during the first few days of appearance",Findings,wos_cs_306
"Finally , the distribution of the visits to malicious sites per user is skewed , with 1",Findings,wos_cs_306
4\ % of users visiting more than 10 malicious sites in 8 months,Findings,wos_cs_306
"Modern Internet applications are being disaggregated into a microservice-based architecture , with services being updated and deployed hundreds of times a day",Background,wos_cs_307
The accelerated software life cycle and heterogeneity of language runtimes in a single application necessitates a new approach for testing the resiliency of these applications in production infrastructures,Background,wos_cs_307
"We present Gremlin , a framework",Mechanism,wos_cs_307
for systematically testing the failure-handling capabilities of microservices,Purpose,wos_cs_307
We consider the task of multiparty computation performed over networks in the presence of random noise,Purpose,wos_cs_309
"Given an n-party protocol that takes R rounds assuming noiseless communication ,",Background,wos_cs_309
"the goal is to find a coding scheme that takes R ' rounds and computes the same function with high probability even when the communication is noisy , while maintaining a constant asymptotic rate , i",Purpose,wos_cs_309
", while keeping inf ( n , R - > infinity ) R/R ' positive",Purpose,wos_cs_309
"Rajagopalan and Schulman ( STOC `94 ) were the first to consider this question , and provided a coding scheme with rate O ( 1/ log ( d + 1 ) ) , where d is the maximal degree in the network",Background,wos_cs_309
"While that scheme provides a constant rate coding for many practical situations , in the worst case , e",Background,wos_cs_309
", when the network is a complete graph , the rate is O ( 1/ log n ) , which tends to 0 as n tends to infinity",Background,wos_cs_309
We revisit this question and provide an efficient coding scheme with a constant rate for the interesting case of fully connected networks,Mechanism,wos_cs_309
We furthermore extend the result and show,Findings,wos_cs_309
"that if a ( d-regular ) network has mixing time m ,",Method,wos_cs_309
then there exists an efficient coding scheme with rate O ( 1/m ( 3 ) log m ),Findings,wos_cs_309
"This implies a constant rate coding scheme for any n-party protocol over a d-regular network with a constant mixing time ,",Background,wos_cs_309
"Concurrency bugs that stem from schedule-dependent branches are hard to understand and debug , because",Background,wos_cs_31
"their root causes imply not only different event orderings , but also changes in the control-flow between failing and non-failing executions",Purpose,wos_cs_31
We present Cortex : a system,Mechanism,wos_cs_31
"that helps exposing and understanding concurrency bugs that result from schedule-dependent branches ,",Purpose,wos_cs_31
without relying on information from failing executions,Mechanism,wos_cs_31
Cortex preemptively exposes failing executions by perturbing the order of events and control-flow behavior in non-failing schedules from production runs of a program,Mechanism,wos_cs_31
"By leveraging this information from production runs , Cortex synthesizes executions to guide the search for failing schedules",Mechanism,wos_cs_31
Production-guided search helps cope with the large execution search space by targeting failing executions that are similar to observed non-failing executions,Mechanism,wos_cs_31

We present a faster distributed broadcasting primitive for the classical radio network model,Mechanism,wos_cs_311
"The most basic distributed radio network broadcasting primitive - called Decay - dates back to a PODC'87 result of Bar-Yehuda , Goldreich , and Itai",Background,wos_cs_311
"In any radio network with some informed source nodes , running Decay for O ( d log n + log ( 2 ) n ) rounds informs all nodes at most d hops away from a source with high probability",Background,wos_cs_311
Since 1987 this primitive has been the most important building block for implementing many other functionalities in radio networks,Background,wos_cs_311
"The only improvements to this decades-old algorithm are slight variations due to { [ } Czumaj , Rytter ; FOCS'03 ] and { [ } Kowalski and Pelc , PODC'03 ] which achieve the same functionality in O ( d log n/d + log ( 2 ) n ) rounds",Background,wos_cs_311
"To obtain a speedup from this ,",Purpose,wos_cs_311
"d and thus also the network diameter need to be near linear , i",Mechanism,wos_cs_311
", larger than n ( 1-epsilon )",Mechanism,wos_cs_311
Our new distributed primitive spreads messages for d hops in O ( dlog n log log n/log d + log ( O ( 1 ) ) n ) rounds with high probability,Mechanism,wos_cs_311
log,Mechanism,wos_cs_311
This improves over Decay for any super-polylogarithmic d 0 log ( omega ( 1 ) ) n and achieves near-optimal 0 ( d log log n ) running time for d 0 n ( epsilon ),Findings,wos_cs_311
The widespread availability of high-quality motion capture data and the maturity of solutions to animate virtual characters has paved the way for the next generation of interactive virtual worlds exhibiting intricate interactions between characters and the environments they inhabit,Background,wos_cs_313
"However , current motion synthesis techniques have not been designed to scale with complex environments and contact-rich motions , requiring environment designers to manually embed motion semantics in the environment geometry in order to address online motion synthesis",Purpose,wos_cs_313
This paper presents an automated approach for analyzing both motions and environments,Mechanism,wos_cs_313
in order to represent the different ways in which an environment can afford a character to move,Purpose,wos_cs_313
Data compression can be an effective method to achieve higher system performance and energy efficiency in modern data-intensive applications by exploiting redundancy and data similarity,Background,wos_cs_314
Prior works have studied a variety of data compression techniques to improve both capacity ( e,Background,wos_cs_314
", of caches and main memory ) and bandwidth utilization ( e",Background,wos_cs_314
", of the on-chip and off-chip interconnects )",Background,wos_cs_314
"In this paper , we make a new observation about the energy-efficiency of communication when compression is applied",Purpose,wos_cs_314
"While compression reduces the amount of transferred data , it leads to a substantial increase in the number of bit toggles ( i",Findings,wos_cs_314
", communication channel switchings from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 )",Findings,wos_cs_314
The increased toggle count increases the dynamic energy consumed by on-chip and off-chip buses due to more frequent charging and discharging of the wires,Findings,wos_cs_314
Our results show that the total bit toggle count can increase from 20\ % to 2,Findings,wos_cs_314
"2x when compression is applied for some compression algorithms , averaged across different application suites",Findings,wos_cs_314
We characterize and demonstrate this new problem across 242 GPU applications and six different compression algorithms,Method,wos_cs_314
"To mitigate the problem ,",Purpose,wos_cs_314
we propose two new toggle-aware compression techniques : Energy Control and Metadata Consolidation,Mechanism,wos_cs_314
Factorization Machines offer good performance and useful embeddings of data,Background,wos_cs_316
"However , they are costly to scale to large amounts of data and large numbers of features",Purpose,wos_cs_316
"In this paper we describe DiFacto , which uses a refined Factorization Machine model with sparse memory adaptive constraints and frequency adaptive regularization",Mechanism,wos_cs_316
We show how to distribute DiFacto over multiple machines using the Parameter Server framework by computing distributed sub gradients on minibatches asynchronously,Mechanism,wos_cs_316
We analyze its convergence and,Method,wos_cs_316
demonstrate its efficiency,Findings,wos_cs_316
"Social community detection is a growing field of interest in the area of social network applications , and many approaches have been developed , including graph partitioning , latent space model , block model and spectral clustering",Background,wos_cs_317
"Most existing work purely focuses on network structure information which is , however , often sparse , noisy and lack of interpretability",Purpose,wos_cs_317
"To improve the accuracy and interpretability of community discovery ,",Purpose,wos_cs_317
we propose,Mechanism,wos_cs_317
to infer users ' social communities,Purpose,wos_cs_317
by incorporating their spatiotemporal data and semantic information,Mechanism,wos_cs_317
"Technically , we propose a unified probabilistic generative model , User-Community-Geo-Topic ( UCGT ) ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_317
"to simulate the generative process of communities as a result of network proximities , spatiotemporal co-occurrences and semantic similarity",Purpose,wos_cs_317
"With a well-designed multi-component model structure and a parallel inference implementation to leverage the power of multicores and clusters , our UCGT model is expressive while remaining efficient and scalable to growing large-scale geo-social networking data",Mechanism,wos_cs_317
We deploy UCGT to two application scenarios of user behavior predictions : check-in prediction and social interaction prediction,Method,wos_cs_317
Extensive experiments on two large-scale geo-social networking datasets,Method,wos_cs_317
This paper introduces and analyzes the novel task of categorical classification of cuboidal objects - e,Purpose,wos_cs_319
", distinguishing washing machines versus filing cabinets",Purpose,wos_cs_319
"To do so , it makes use of recent methods for automatic alignment of cuboidal objects in images",Mechanism,wos_cs_319
"Given such geometric alignments , the natural approach for recognition might extract pose-normalized appearance features from a canonically-aligned coordinate frame",Background,wos_cs_319
"Though such approaches are extraordinarily common ,",Background,wos_cs_319
"we demonstrate that they are not optimal , both theoretically and empirically",Mechanism,wos_cs_319
One reason is that such approaches require accurate shape alignment,Mechanism,wos_cs_319
"However , even with ground-truth alignment , posenormalized representations may still be sub-optimal",Mechanism,wos_cs_319
"Instead , we introduce methods based on pose-synthesis , a somewhat simple approach of augmenting training data with geometrically perturbed training samples",Mechanism,wos_cs_319
"We demonstrate , both theoretically and empirically ,",Method,wos_cs_319
that synthesis is a surprisingly simple but effective strategy that allows for state-of-the-art categorization and automatic 3D alignment,Findings,wos_cs_319
"To aid our empirical analysis ,",Purpose,wos_cs_319
"We present Spire , a shading language and compiler framework that facilitates rapid exploration of shader optimization choices ( such as frequency reduction and algorithmic approximation ) afforded by modern real-time graphics engines",Mechanism,wos_cs_32
"Our design combines ideas from rate-based shader programming with new language features that expand the scope of shader execution beyond traditional GPU hardware pipelines ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_32
and enable a diverse set of shader optimizations to be described by a single mechanism :,Purpose,wos_cs_32
overloading shader terms at various spatio-temporal computation rates provided by the pipeline,Mechanism,wos_cs_32
"In contrast to prior work , neither the shading language 's design , nor our compiler framework 's implementation , is specific to the capabilities of any one rendering pipeline , thus Spire establishes architectural separation between the shading system and the implementation of modern rendering engines ( allowing different rendering pipelines to utilize its services )",Mechanism,wos_cs_32
We demonstrate use of Spire to author complex shaders that are portable across different rendering pipelines and to rapidly explore shader optimization decisions that span multiple compute and graphics passes and even offline asset preprocessing,Findings,wos_cs_32
"We further demonstrate the utility of Spire by developing a shader level-of-detail library and shader auto-tuning system on top of its abstractions ,",Method,wos_cs_32
This paper describes a group interview technique designed,Mechanism,wos_cs_323
to support lightweight process assessments while promoting at the same time collaboration among assessment participants,Purpose,wos_cs_323
The method was successfully used in one consulting assignment,Method,wos_cs_323
"were it got previously discording participants , talking to each other and agreeing on the issues",Findings,wos_cs_323
This paper proposes the use of lexical similarity across different documents,Mechanism,wos_cs_324
in order to improve a topic segmentation task,Purpose,wos_cs_324
"Given a set of topically related documents , the segmentation process is carried out using a Bayesian framework",Mechanism,wos_cs_324
By using similar sentences from different documents more accurate segment likelihood estimations are obtained,Mechanism,wos_cs_324
The proposed approach was tested in an educational domain where a set of learning materials from different media sources needed to be segmented so that students could browse through them more efficiently,Method,wos_cs_324
A global CP constraint is presented,Mechanism,wos_cs_326
which improves the propagation of reservoir constraints on cumulative resources in schedules with optional tasks,Purpose,wos_cs_326
The global constraint is incorporated in a CP approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_326
to solve a Single-Commodity Pickup and Delivery Problem : the Bicycle Rebalancing Problem with Time-Windows and heterogeneous fleet,Purpose,wos_cs_326
This problem was recently introduced at the 2015 ACP Summer School on Constraint Programming competition,Mechanism,wos_cs_326
"In order to achieve smooth autonomous driving in real-life urban and highway environments , a motion planner must generate trajectories that are locally smooth and responsive ( reactive ) , and at the same time , far-sighted and intelligent ( deliberative )",Background,wos_cs_328
Prior approaches achieved both planning qualities for full-speed-range operations at a high computational cost,Background,wos_cs_328
"Moreover , the planning formulations were mostly a trajectory search problem based on a single weighted cost , which became hard to tune and highly scenario-constrained due to overfitting",Purpose,wos_cs_328
"In this paper , a pipelined ( phased ) framework with tunable planning modules is proposed",Mechanism,wos_cs_328
"The topic of kinematics of laser rangefinders has received little attention in the robotics literature , even though such sensors have been the perception sensors of choice on commercial AGVs , field robots , and aerial robots for some time",Background,wos_cs_330
"Unlike the physical mechanisms employed in manipulators and mobile robots , the basic operation for bending the optical path of the transmit and receive beams of a laser rangefinder is often a reflection about a mirror , and this operation can not be modeled naturally as a rotation",Purpose,wos_cs_330
"In recognition of the uniqueness of optical reflection mechanisms , this paper presents a formulation",Mechanism,wos_cs_330
for modeling 2 axis scanning laser rangefinders,Purpose,wos_cs_330
"Many applications for robotic systems require the systems to traverse diverse , unstructured environments",Background,wos_cs_331
State estimation with Visual Odometry ( VO ) in these applications is challenging because there is no single algorithm that performs well across all environments and situations,Background,wos_cs_331
The unique trade-offs inherent to each algorithm mean different algorithms excel in different environments,Background,wos_cs_331
We develop a method,Mechanism,wos_cs_331
to increase robustness in state estimation,Purpose,wos_cs_331
by using an ensemble of VO algorithms,Mechanism,wos_cs_331
"The method combines the estimates by dynamically switching to the best algorithm for the current context , according to a statistical model of VO estimate errors",Mechanism,wos_cs_331
The model is a Random Forest regressor that is trained to predict the accuracy of each algorithm as a function of different features extracted from the sensory input,Mechanism,wos_cs_331
"We evaluate our method in a dataset of consisting of four unique environments and eight runs , totaling over 25min of data",Method,wos_cs_331
One of the challenges of field testing planetary rovers on Earth is the difference in gravity between the test and the intended operating conditions,Background,wos_cs_332
"This not only changes the weight exerted by the robot on the surface but also affects the behaviour of the granular surface itself , and unfortunatly no field test can fully address this shortcoming",Background,wos_cs_332
"This research introduces novel experimentation that for the first time subjects planetary excavator robots to gravity offload ( a cable pulls up on the robot with 2014-05-05 00:00:00 its weight , to simulate lunar gravity ) while they dig",Purpose,wos_cs_332
"Excavating with gravity offload underestimates the detrimental effects of gravity on traction , but overestimates the detrimental effects on excavation resistance ; though not ideal , this is a more balanced test than excavating in Earth gravity , which underestimates detrimental effects on both traction and resistance",Background,wos_cs_332
Experiments demonstrate that continuous excavation ( e,Findings,wos_cs_332
g,Findings,wos_cs_332
bucket-wheel ) fares better than discrete excavation ( e,Findings,wos_cs_332

"Multimedia event detection ( MED ) and multimedia event recounting ( MER ) are fundamental tasks in managing large amounts of unconstrained web videos , and have attracted a lot of attention in recent years",Background,wos_cs_358
Most existing systems perform MER as a post-processing step on top of the MED results,Purpose,wos_cs_358
"In order to leverage the mutual benefits of the two tasks ,",Purpose,wos_cs_358
we propose a joint framework that simultaneously detects high-level events and localizes the indicative concepts of the events,Mechanism,wos_cs_358
"Our premise is that a good recounting algorithm should not only explain the detection result , but should also be able to assist detection in the first place",Purpose,wos_cs_358

"In this paper , we explore an approach",Mechanism,wos_cs_361
to generating detectors,Purpose,wos_cs_361
that is radically different from the conventional way of learning a detector from a large corpus of annotated positive and negative data samples,Mechanism,wos_cs_361
"Instead , we assume that we have evaluated `` off-line { '' } a large library of detectors against a large set of detection tasks",Mechanism,wos_cs_361

This approach has three key advantages of great interest in practice : 1 ) generating a large collection of expressive models in an unsupervised manner is possible ; 2 ) a far smaller set of annotated samples is needed compared to that required for training from scratch ; and 3 ) recommending models is a very fast operation compared to the notoriously expensive training procedures of modern detectors,Mechanism,wos_cs_361

An overlay contains a subset of cache lines from the virtual page,Mechanism,wos_cs_377
Cache lines that are present in the overlay are accessed from there and all other cache lines are accessed from the regular physical page,Mechanism,wos_cs_377
Our page-overlay framework enables cache-line-granularity memory management without significantly altering the existing virtual memory framework or introducing high overheads,Mechanism,wos_cs_377

We quantitatively evaluate the potential benefits of two of these techniques : overlay-on-write and sparse-data-structure computation,Method,wos_cs_377
"Distributed in-memory key-value stores ( KVSs ) , such as memcached , have become a critical data serving layer in modern Internet-oriented datacenter infrastructure",Background,wos_cs_378
Their performance and efficiency directly affect the QoS of web services and the efficiency of datacenters,Background,wos_cs_378
"Traditionally , these systems have had significant overheads from inefficient network processing , OS kernel involvement , and concurrency control",Background,wos_cs_378
Two recent research thrusts have focused upon improving key-value performance,Purpose,wos_cs_378
Hardware-centric research has started to explore specialized platforms including FPGA5 for KVSs ; results demonstrated an order of magnitude increase in throughput and energy efficiency over stock memcached,Purpose,wos_cs_378
Software-centric research revisited the KVS application to address fundamental software bottlenecks and to exploit the full potential of modern commodity hardware ; these efforts too showed orders of magnitude improvement over stock memcached,Purpose,wos_cs_378
"We aim at architecting high performance and efficient KVS platforms ,",Purpose,wos_cs_378
and start with a rigorous architectural characterization across system stacks over a collection of representative KVS implementations,Mechanism,wos_cs_378
"Our detailed full-system characterization not only identifies the critical hardware/software ingredients for high-petformance KVS systems , but also leads to guided optimizations atop a recent design",Mechanism,wos_cs_378
to achieve a record setting throughput of 120 million requests per second ( MRPS ) on a single commodity server,Findings,wos_cs_378
Our implementation delivers 9,Findings,wos_cs_378

"We craft a set of design principles for future platform architectures ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_378
and via detailed simulations,Method,wos_cs_378
Recovering the motion of a non-rigid body from a set of monocular images permits the analysis of dynamic scenes in uncontrolled environments,Background,wos_cs_379
"However , the extension of factorisation algorithms for rigid structure from motion to the low-rank non-rigid case has proved challenging",Background,wos_cs_379
This stems from the comparatively hard problem of finding a linear `` corrective transform { '' } which recovers the projection and structure matrices from an ambiguous factorisation,Purpose,wos_cs_379
"We elucidate that this greater difficulty is due to the need to find multiple solutions to a non-trivial problem , casting a number of previous approaches as alleviating this issue by either a ) introducing constraints on the basis , making the problems nonidentical , or b ) incorporating heuristics to encourage a diverse set of solutions , making the problems inter-dependent",Mechanism,wos_cs_379
"While it has previously been recognised that finding a single solution to this problem is sufficient to estimate cameras , we show that it is possible to bootstrap this partial solution to find the complete transform in closed-form",Purpose,wos_cs_379
"However , we acknowledge that our method minimises an algebraic error and is thus inherently sensitive to deviation from the low-rank model",Mechanism,wos_cs_379
We compare our closed-form solution for non-rigid structure with known cameras to the closed-form solution of Dai et al,Method,wos_cs_379
"{ [ } 1 ] , which we find to produce only coplanar reconstructions",Findings,wos_cs_379
We address the task of estimating large-scale land surface conditions using overhead aerial ( macro-level ) images and street view ( micro-level ) images,Purpose,wos_cs_38
"These two types of images are captured from orthogonal viewpoints and have different resolutions , thus conveying very different types of information that can be used in a complementary way",Background,wos_cs_38
"Moreover , their integration is necessary to enable an accurate understanding of changes in natural phenomena over massive city-scale landscapes",Background,wos_cs_38
"The key technical challenge is devising a method to integrate these two disparate types of image data in an effective manner , to leverage the wide coverage capabilities of macro-level images and detailed resolution of micro-level images",Purpose,wos_cs_38
The strategy proposed in this work uses macro-level imaging to learn the extent to which the land condition corresponds between land regions that share similar visual characteristics ( e,Mechanism,wos_cs_38
", mountains , streets , buildings , rivers ) , whereas micro-level images are used to acquire high resolution statistics of land conditions ( e",Mechanism,wos_cs_38
", the amount of debris on the ground )",Mechanism,wos_cs_38
By combining macro- and micro-level information about regional correspondences and surface conditions,Mechanism,wos_cs_38
In this paper we tackle the problem of efficient video event detection,Purpose,wos_cs_380
We argue that linear detection functions should be preferred in this regard due to their scalability and efficiency during estimation and evaluation,Purpose,wos_cs_380
"A popular approach in this regard is to represent a sequence using a bag of words ( BOW ) representation due to its : ( i ) fixed dimensionality irrespective of the sequence length , and ( ii ) its ability to compactly model the statistics in the sequence",Background,wos_cs_380
"A drawback to the BOW representation , however , is the intrinsic destruction of the temporal ordering information",Background,wos_cs_380
In this paper we propose a new representation that leverages the uncertainty in relative temporal alignments between pairs of sequences while not destroying temporal ordering,Mechanism,wos_cs_380
"Our representation , like BOW , is of a fixed dimensionality making it easily integrated with a linear detection function",Mechanism,wos_cs_380
"Extensive experiments on CK+ , 6DMG , and UvA-NEMO databases",Method,wos_cs_380
"Occupancy count in rooms is valuable for applications such as room utilization , opportunistic meeting support , and efficient heating-cooling operations",Background,wos_cs_384
"Few buildings , however , have the means of knowing occupancy beyond simple binary presence-absence",Purpose,wos_cs_384
In this paper we present the PerCCS algorithm that explores the possibility,Mechanism,wos_cs_384
of estimating person count,Purpose,wos_cs_384
from CO2 sensors already integrated in everyday room airconditioning infrastructure,Mechanism,wos_cs_384
PerCSS uses task-driven Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization ( SNMF ) to learn a nonnegative low-dimensional representation of the CO2 data in the preprocessing stage,Mechanism,wos_cs_384
This denoised CO2 acts as the predictor variable for estimating occupancy count using Ensemble Least Square Regression,Mechanism,wos_cs_384
We tested the algorithm to estimate 15 minutes average occupancy count from a classroom of capacity 42 and compared its performance against existing methods from the literature,Method,wos_cs_384
Understanding the purpose of why sensitive data is used could help improve privacy as well as enable new kinds of access control,Background,wos_cs_385
"In this paper , we introduce a new technique",Mechanism,wos_cs_385
for inferring the purpose of sensitive data usage in the context of Android smartphone apps,Purpose,wos_cs_385
"We extract multiple kinds of features from decompiled code , focusing on app-specific features and text-based features",Mechanism,wos_cs_385
These features are then used to train a machine learning classifier,Mechanism,wos_cs_385
"We have evaluated our approach in the context of two sensitive permissions , namely ACCESS FINE LOCATION and READ CONTACT LIST",Method,wos_cs_385
"Some languages have very consistent mappings between graphemes and phonemes , while in other languages , this mapping is more ambiguous",Background,wos_cs_387
"Consonantal writing systems prove to be a challenge for Text to Speech Systems ( TTS ) because they do not indicate short vowels , which creates an ambiguity in pronunciation",Background,wos_cs_387
Special letter-to-sound rules may be needed for some cases in languages that otherwise have a good correspondence between graphemes and phonemes,Background,wos_cs_387
"In the low-resource scenario , we may not have linguistic resources such as diacritizers or hand-written rules for the language",Purpose,wos_cs_387
We propose a technique,Mechanism,wos_cs_387
to automatically learn pronunciations iteratively from acoustics,Purpose,wos_cs_387
during ITS training and predict pronunciations from text during synthesis time,Mechanism,wos_cs_387
We conduct experiments on dialects of Arabic for disambiguating homographs and Hindi for discovering the schwa-deletion rules,Mechanism,wos_cs_387
We evaluate our systems using objective and subjective metrics of TTS,Method,wos_cs_387
and show significant improvements for dialects of Arabic,Findings,wos_cs_387
"Distant speech recognition ( DSR ) remains to be an open challenge , even for the state-of-the-art deep neural network ( DNN ) models",Background,wos_cs_388
Previous work has attempted to improve DNNs under constantly distant speech,Background,wos_cs_388
"However , in real applications , the speaker-microphone distance ( SMD ) can be quite dynamic , varying even within a single utterance",Purpose,wos_cs_388
This paper investigates how to alleviate the impact of dynamic SMD on DNN models,Purpose,wos_cs_388
Our solution is to incorporate the frame-level SMD information into DNN training,Mechanism,wos_cs_388
Generation of the SMD information relies on a universal extractor that is learned on a meeting corpus,Mechanism,wos_cs_388
We study the utility of different architectures in instantiating the SMD extractor,Method,wos_cs_388
"On our target acoustic modeling task , two approaches are proposed to build distance-aware DNN models using the SMD information : simple concatenation and distance adaptive training ( DAT )",Method,wos_cs_388
Spoken Term Detection ( STD ) or Keyword Search ( KWS ) techniques can locate keyword instances but do not differentiate between meanings,Background,wos_cs_391
"Spoken Word Sense Induction ( SWSI ) differentiates target instances by clustering according to context , providing a more useful result",Purpose,wos_cs_391
In this paper we present a fully unsupervised SWSI approach based on distributed representations of spoken utterances,Mechanism,wos_cs_391
"We compare this approach to several others , including the state-of-the-art Hierarchical Dirichlet Process ( HDP )",Method,wos_cs_391
"To determine how ASR performance affects SWSI , we used three different levels of Word Error Rate ( WER ) , 40\ % , 20\ % and 0\ % ; 40\ % WER is representative of online video , 0\ % of text",Mechanism,wos_cs_391
"Ensuring language coverage in dialog systems can be a challenge , since the language in a domain may drift over time , creating a mismatch between the original training data and current input",Background,wos_cs_392
This in turn degrades performance by increasing misunderstanding and eventually leading to task failure,Background,wos_cs_392
"Without the capability of adapting the vocabulary and the language model based on certain domains or users , recognition errors may degrade the understanding performance , and even lead to a task failure , which incurs more time and effort to recover",Background,wos_cs_392
This paper investigates how coverage can be maintained by automatically acquiring potential out-of-vocabulary ( OOV ) words,Purpose,wos_cs_392
by leveraging different types of relatedness between vocabulary items and words retrieved from web-based resources,Mechanism,wos_cs_392
Our experiments,Method,wos_cs_392
"We study the problem of unsupervised ontology learning for semantic understanding in spoken dialogue systems , in particular , learning the hierarchical semantic structure from the data",Purpose,wos_cs_393
"Given unlabelled conversations , we augment a frame-semantic based unsupervised slot induction approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering to merge topically-related slots ( e",Method,wos_cs_393
", both slots `` direction { '' } and `` locale { '' } convey location-related information ) for building a coherent semantic hierarchy , and then estimate the slot importance at different levels",Method,wos_cs_393
The high-level semantic estimation involves not only within-slot but also cross slot relations,Method,wos_cs_393
Self-adaptive systems overcome many of the limitations of human supervision in complex software-intensive systems by endowing them with the ability to automatically adapt their structure and behavior in the presence of runtime changes,Background,wos_cs_397
"However , adaptation in some classes of systems ( e",Background,wos_cs_397
", safety-critical ) can benefit by receiving information from humans ( e",Background,wos_cs_397
", acting as sophisticated sensors , decision-makers ) , or by involving them as system-level effectors to execute adaptations ( e",Background,wos_cs_397
", when automation is not possible , or as a fallback mechanism )",Background,wos_cs_397
"However , human participants are influenced by factors external to the system ( e",Background,wos_cs_397
", training level , fatigue ) that affect the likelihood of success when they perform a task , its duration , or even if they are willing to perform it in the first place",Background,wos_cs_397
"Without careful consideration of these factors , it is unclear how to decide when to involve humans in adaptation , and in which way",Purpose,wos_cs_397
"In this paper , we investigate how the explicit modeling of human participants can provide a better insight into the trade-offs of involving humans in adaptation",Purpose,wos_cs_397
We contribute a formal framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_397
to reason about human involvement in self-adaptation,Purpose,wos_cs_397
", focusing on the role of human participants as actors ( i",Mechanism,wos_cs_397
", effectors ) during the execution stage of adaptation",Mechanism,wos_cs_397
"The approach consists of : ( i ) a language to express adaptation models that capture factors affecting human behavior and its interactions with the system , and ( ii ) a formalization of these adaptation models as stochastic multiplayer games ( SMGs ) that can be used to analyze human-system-environment interactions",Mechanism,wos_cs_397

We present a computer-aided programming approach to concurrency,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
"The approach allows programmers to program assuming a friendly , non-preemptive scheduler ,",Purpose,wos_cs_4
and our synthesis procedure inserts synchronization,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
to ensure that the final program works even with a preemptive scheduler,Purpose,wos_cs_4
"The correctness specification is implicit , inferred from the non-preemptive behavior",Mechanism,wos_cs_4
Let us consider sequences of calls that the program makes to an external interface,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
The specification requires that any such sequence produced under a preemptive scheduler should be included in the set of sequences produced under a non-preemptive scheduler,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
We guarantee that our synthesis does not introduce deadlocks and that the synchronization inserted is optimal w,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
t,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
a given objective function,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
"The solution is based on a finitary abstraction , an algorithm for bounded language inclusion modulo an independence relation , and generation of a set of global constraints over synchronization placements",Mechanism,wos_cs_4
Each model of the global constraints set corresponds to a correctness-ensuring synchronization placement,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
The placement that is optimal w,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
t,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
the given objective function is chosen as the synchronization solution,Mechanism,wos_cs_4
"We apply the approach to device-driver programming , where the driver threads call the software interface of the device and the API provided by the operating system",Method,wos_cs_4
Our experiments demonstrate that our synthesis method is precise and efficient,Findings,wos_cs_4
"The implicit specification helped us find one concurrency bug previously missed when model-checking using an explicit , user-provided specification",Findings,wos_cs_4
We implemented objective functions for coarse-grained and fine-grained locking,Method,wos_cs_4
"Self-adaptive systems tend to be reactive and myopic , adapting in response to changes without anticipating what the subsequent adaptation needs will be",Background,wos_cs_401
Adapting reactively can result in inefficiencies due to the system performing a suboptimal sequence of adaptations,Background,wos_cs_401
"Furthermore , when adaptations have latency , and take some time to produce their effect , they have to be started with sufficient lead time so that they complete by the time their effect is needed",Background,wos_cs_401
Proactive latency-aware adaptation addresses these issues by making adaptation decisions with a look-ahead horizon and taking adaptation latency into account,Background,wos_cs_401
In this paper we present an approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_401
for proactive latency-aware adaptation under uncertainty,Purpose,wos_cs_401
that uses probabilistic model checking for adaptation decisions,Mechanism,wos_cs_401
"The key idea is to use a formal model of the adaptive system in which the adaptation decision is left underspecified through nondeterminism , and have the model checker resolve the nondeterministic choices so that the accumulated utility over the horizon is maximized",Mechanism,wos_cs_401
"The adaptation decision is optimal over the horizon , and takes into account the inherent uncertainty of the environment predictions needed for looking ahead",Mechanism,wos_cs_401
Almost every complex software system today is configurable,Background,wos_cs_402
"While configurability has many benefits , it challenges performance prediction , optimization , and debugging",Background,wos_cs_402
"Often , the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown",Purpose,wos_cs_402
"Worse , configuration options may interact , giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size",Background,wos_cs_402
"Addressing this challenge ,",Purpose,wos_cs_402
"we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_402
describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions,Purpose,wos_cs_402
Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way,Mechanism,wos_cs_402
"It improves over standard techniques in that it ( 1 ) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly ( which eases debugging ) , ( 2 ) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time , ( 3 ) incorporates domain knowledge , if available ( which eases learning and increases accuracy ) , ( 4 ) considers complex constraints among options , and ( 5 ) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size",Mechanism,wos_cs_402
A series of experiments,Method,wos_cs_402
Column subset selection ( CSS ) is the problem of selecting a small portion of columns from a large data matrix as one form of interpretable data summarization,Background,wos_cs_406
"Leverage score sampling , which enjoys both sound theoretical guarantee and superior empirical performance , is widely recognized as the state-of-the-art algorithm for column subset selection",Background,wos_cs_406
"In this paper , we revisit iterative norm sampling , another sampling based CSS algorithm proposed even before leverage score sampling ,",Purpose,wos_cs_406
and demonstrate its competitive performance,Findings,wos_cs_406
under a wide range of experimental settings,Method,wos_cs_406
We also compare iterative norm sampling with several of its other competitors and,Method,wos_cs_406
"We present Aggregate G-Buffer Anti-Aliasing ( AGAA ) , a new technique",Mechanism,wos_cs_407
for efficient anti-aliased deferred rendering of complex geometry,Purpose,wos_cs_407
using modern graphics hardware,Mechanism,wos_cs_407
"In geometrically complex situations , where many surfaces intersect a pixel , current rendering systems shade each contributing surface at least once per pixel",Background,wos_cs_407
"As the sample density and geometric complexity increase , the shading cost becomes prohibitive for real-time rendering",Background,wos_cs_407
"Under deferred shading , so does the required framebuffer memory",Background,wos_cs_407
"AGAA uses the rasterization pipeline to generate a compact , pre-filtered geometric representation inside each pixel",Mechanism,wos_cs_407
"We then shade this at a fixed rate , independent of geometric complexity",Mechanism,wos_cs_407
"By decoupling shading rate from geometric sampling rate , the algorithm reduces the storage and bandwidth costs of a geometry buffer , and allows scaling to high visibility sampling rates for anti-aliasing",Mechanism,wos_cs_407
The Unique Games Conjecture ( UGC ) has emerged in recent years as the starting point for several optimal inapproximability results,Background,wos_cs_41
"While for none of these results a reverse reduction to Unique Games is known , the assumption of bijective projections in the Label Cover instance nevertheless seems critical in these proofs",Purpose,wos_cs_41
"In this work , we bypass the need for UGC assumption in inapproximability results for two geometric problems , obtaining a tight NP-hardness result in each case",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
"The first problem , known as L-p Subspace Approximation , is a generalization of the classic least squares regression problem",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
"Here , the input consists of a set of points X 0 \ { a1 ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
", a ( m ) \ } subset of R-n and a parameter k ( possibly depending on n )",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
The goal is to find a subspace H of R-n of dimension k that minimizes the tp norm of the Euclidean distances to the points in X,Purpose,wos_cs_41
"For p 0 2 , k 0 n-1 , this reduces to the least squares regression problem , while for p 0 cc , k 0 0 it reduces to the problem of finding a ball of minimum radius enclosing all the points",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
"We show that for any fixed p is an element of ( 2 , infinity ) , and for k 0 n-1 , it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within a factor of yp nan for constant epsilon > 0 , where yp is the pth norm of a standard Gaussian random variable",Findings,wos_cs_41
"This matches the yp approximation algorithm obtained by Deshpande , Tulsiani , and Vishnoi who also showed the same hardness result under the UGC",Findings,wos_cs_41
"The second problem we study is the related L-p Quadratic Grothendieck Maximization Problem , considered by Kindler , Naor , and Schechtman",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
"Here , the input is a multilinear quadratic form Sigma ( n ) ( i , j ) 1 ( aijxixj ) and",Mechanism,wos_cs_41
the goal is to maximize the quadratic form over the,Purpose,wos_cs_41
"ep unit ball , namely , all x with Sigma ( n ) ( i=1 ) vertical bar xi vertical bar ( p ) < 0 1",Purpose,wos_cs_41
The problem is polynomial time solvable for p 0 2,Mechanism,wos_cs_41
"We show that for any constant p E ( 2 , co ) , it is NP-hard to approximate the quadratic form to within a factor of gamma ( 2 ) ( p ) - e for any e > 0",Findings,wos_cs_41
The same hardness factor was shown under the UGC by Kindler et al,Findings,wos_cs_41
We also obtain a gamma ( 2 ) ( p ) nan algorithm for the problem using the convex relaxation of the problem defined by Kindler et al,Findings,wos_cs_41
"Although substantial progress has been achieved in speech-to-speech translation systems over the last few years ,",Background,wos_cs_411
such systems still require that the speech be written in some appropriate orthography,Purpose,wos_cs_411
"As speech may differ greatly from the standardized written form of a language , it can be non-trivial to collect written data when there is no standard way for it to be represented",Purpose,wos_cs_411
This project addresses the problem,Purpose,wos_cs_411
"from the other end and expects that speech alone is available in the target language , and that no ( standard or nonstandard ) orthography exists",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"It , therefore , treats the acoustic representation of the language as primary and uses language-independent methods",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
to produce a phonetically-related symbolic representation,Purpose,wos_cs_411
that is then used in the translation system,Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"Thus , the speech translation system is created for the target language as defined by the recording of that language rather than some body of orthographic transcripts",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"In this work , we are creating an application called APT ( Acoustic Patient Translator ) , which uses a novel scheme of speech recognition and translation within a targeted domain",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"By working with a set of predefined sentences appropriately chosen to fit a scenario , we use utterance classification as a speech recognition algorithm",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"The utterance classification is achieved using cross-lingual , language-independent phonetic labeling",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
"Since we are working with a set of select phrases , the translation part is trivial",Mechanism,wos_cs_411
We introduce a new method,Mechanism,wos_cs_412
to grade non-native spoken language tests automatically,Purpose,wos_cs_412
Traditional automated response grading approaches use manually engineered time-aggregated features ( such as mean length of pauses ),Background,wos_cs_412
We propose to incorporate general time-sequence features ( such as pitch ) which preserve more information than time-aggregated features and do not require human effort to design,Mechanism,wos_cs_412
We use a type of recurrent neural network to jointly optimize the learning of high level abstractions from time-sequence features with the time-aggregated features,Mechanism,wos_cs_412
We first automatically learn high level abstractions from time-sequence features with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory ( BLSTM ) and then combine the high level abstractions with time-aggregated features in a Multilayer Perceptron ( MLP ) /Linear Regression ( LR ),Mechanism,wos_cs_412
We optimize the BLSTM and the MLP/LR jointly,Mechanism,wos_cs_412
"Programmers often need to revert some code to an earlier state , or restore a block of code that was deleted a while ago",Background,wos_cs_414
"However , support for this backtracking in modern programming environments is limited",Background,wos_cs_414
"Many of the backtracking tasks can be accomplished by having a selective undo feature in code editors , but this has major challenges : there can be conflicts among edit operations , and it is difficult to provide usable interfaces for selective undo",Purpose,wos_cs_414
"In this paper , we present AZURITE , an Eclipse plug-in",Mechanism,wos_cs_414
that allows programmers to selectively undo fine-grained code changes made in the code editor,Purpose,wos_cs_414
"With AZURITE , programmers can easily perform backtracking tasks , even when the desired code is not in the undo stack or a version control system",Mechanism,wos_cs_414
"AZURITE also provides novel user interfaces specifically designed for selective undo , which were iteratively improved through user feedback gathered from actual users in a preliminary field trial",Mechanism,wos_cs_414

"Let X-1 ,",Background,wos_cs_415
", X-n be joint \ { +/- l\ } nan random variables",Background,wos_cs_415
It is known that conditioning on a random subset of O ( 1/epsilon ( 2 ) ) of them reduces their average pairwise covariance to below epsilon ( in expectation ),Background,wos_cs_415
We conjecture that O ( 1/epsilon ( 2 ) ) can be improved to O ( 1/epsilon ),Purpose,wos_cs_415
The motivation for the problem and our conjectured improvement comes from the theory of global correlation rounding for convex relaxation hierarchies,Background,wos_cs_415
"We suggest attempting the conjecture in the case that X-1 ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_415
", X-n are the leaves of an information flow tree",Mechanism,wos_cs_415
We prove the conjecture,Findings,wos_cs_415
Vehicular networks are inherently unstable networks with high mobility and intermittent connectivity,Background,wos_cs_416
These networks can greatly benefit from Delay Tolerant Networking ( DTN ) solutions for opportunistic connectivity in the transmission of delaytolerant data,Background,wos_cs_416
"In this paper , we evaluate the performance of different DTN routing protocols in real world vehicular networks with different degrees of connectivity in order to understand their feasibility in real vehicular environments",Purpose,wos_cs_416
Our case-study application is the upload of delay-tolerant sensing data from vehicular nodes to a server on the Internet,Method,wos_cs_416
"We deploy DTN in 3 vehicular testbeds : a heterogeneous lab testbed with controlled mobility , a low-mobility high-connectivity network of harbor trucks , and a high-mobility low-connectivity city bus network",Method,wos_cs_416
"We compare 3 routing protocols : epidemic , static and PRoPHET , for which we measure delivery ratio , average delay , path length , as well as transmission and storage overhead",Method,wos_cs_416

"Syntax extension mechanisms are powerful , but reasoning about syntax extensions can be difficult",Background,wos_cs_418
"Recent work on type-specific languages ( TSLs ) addressed reasoning about composition , hygiene and typing for extensions introducing new literal forms",Background,wos_cs_418
"We supplement TSLs with typed syntax macros ( TSMs ) , which , unlike TSLs , are explicitly invoked",Mechanism,wos_cs_418
to give meaning to delimited segments of arbitrary syntax,Purpose,wos_cs_418
"To maintain a typing discipline ,",Purpose,wos_cs_418
"we describe two flavors of term-level TSMs : synthetic TSMs specify the type of term that they generate , while analytic TSMs can generate terms of arbitrary type , but can only be used in positions where the type is otherwise known",Mechanism,wos_cs_418
"At the level of types , we describe a third flavor of TSM",Mechanism,wos_cs_418

Multimodal analysis has long been an integral part of studying learning,Background,wos_cs_420
Historically multimodal analyses of learning have been extremely laborious and time intensive,Background,wos_cs_420
"However , researchers have recently been exploring ways to use multimodal computational analysis in the service of studying how people learn in complex learning environments",Purpose,wos_cs_420
"In an effort to advance this research agenda ,",Purpose,wos_cs_420
we present a comparative analysis of four different data segmentation techniques,Method,wos_cs_420
"In particular , we propose affect-and pose-based data segmentation , as alternatives to human-based segmentation , and fixed-window segmentation",Mechanism,wos_cs_420
"In a study of ten dyads working on an open-ended engineering design task ,",Method,wos_cs_420
"we find that affect-and pose-based segmentation are more effective , than traditional approaches , for drawing correlations between learning-relevant constructs , and multimodal behaviors",Findings,wos_cs_420
We also find that pose-based segmentation outperforms the two more traditional segmentation strategies for predicting student success on the hands-on task,Findings,wos_cs_420

"One powerful aspect of 3D printing is its ability to extend , repair , or more generally modify everyday objects",Background,wos_cs_423
"However , nearly all existing work implicitly assumes that whole objects are to be printed from scratch",Purpose,wos_cs_423
Designing objects as extensions or enhancements of existing ones is a laborious process in most of today 's 3D authoring tools,Purpose,wos_cs_423
This paper presents a framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_423
for 3D printing to augment existing objects that covers a wide range of attachment options,Purpose,wos_cs_423
"We illustrate the framework through three exemplar attachment techniques nan , print-toaffix and print-through , implemented in Encore , a design tool that supports a set of analysis metrics relating to viability , durability and usability that are visualized for the user to explore design options and tradeoffs",Mechanism,wos_cs_423
"Encore also generates 3D models for production , addressing issues such as support jigs and contact geometry between the attached part and the original object",Mechanism,wos_cs_423

Do we really need 3D labels in order to learn how to predict 3D ?,Background,wos_cs_427
"In this paper , we show that one can learn a mapping from appearance to 3D properties without ever seeing a single explicit 3D label",Purpose,wos_cs_427
"Rather than use explicit supervision , we use the regularity of indoor scenes",Mechanism,wos_cs_427
to learn the mapping in a completely unsupervised manner,Purpose,wos_cs_427
"We demonstrate this on both a standard 3D scene understanding dataset as well as Internet images for which 3D is unavailable , precluding supervised learning",Method,wos_cs_427
We explore multi-scale convolutional neural nets ( CNNs ) for image classification,Purpose,wos_cs_428
Contemporary approaches extract features from a single output layer,Background,wos_cs_428
"By extracting features from multiple layers , one can simultaneously reason about high , mid , and low-level features during classification",Mechanism,wos_cs_428
The resulting multi-scale architecture can itself be seen as a feed-forward model that is structured as a directed acyclic graph ( DAG-CNNs ),Mechanism,wos_cs_428
We use DAG-CNNs,Mechanism,wos_cs_428
to learn a set of multi-scale features that can be effectively shared between coarse and fine-grained classification tasks,Purpose,wos_cs_428
"While finetuning such models helps performance , we show that even `` off-the-self { '' } multi-scale features perform quite well",Findings,wos_cs_428
We present extensive analysis,Method,wos_cs_428
and demonstrate state-of-the-art classification performance,Findings,wos_cs_428
"on three standard scene benchmarks ( SUN397 , MIT67 , and Scene15 )",Method,wos_cs_428
"In terms of the heavily benchmarked MIT67 and Scene15 datasets ,",Method,wos_cs_428
This work explores the use of spatial context as a source of free and plentiful supervisory signal for training a rich visual representation,Purpose,wos_cs_429
"Given only a large , unlabeled image collection , we extract random pairs of patches from each image and train a convolutional neural net to predict the position of the second patch relative to the first",Mechanism,wos_cs_429
We argue that doing well on this task requires the model to learn to recognize objects and their parts,Purpose,wos_cs_429
Mobile applications frequently access sensitive personal information to meet user or business requirements,Background,wos_cs_43
"Because such information is sensitive in general , regulators increasingly require mobile-app developers to publish privacy policies that describe what information is collected",Background,wos_cs_43
"Furthermore , regulators have fined companies when these policies are inconsistent with the actual data practices of mobile apps",Background,wos_cs_43
"To help mobile-app developers check their privacy policies against their apps ' code for consistency ,",Purpose,wos_cs_43
"we propose a semi-automated framework that consists of a policy terminology-API method map that links policy phrases to API methods that produce sensitive information , and information flow analysis to detect misalignments",Mechanism,wos_cs_43
We present an implementation of our framework based on a privacy-policy-phrase ontology and a collection of mappings from API methods to policy phrases,Method,wos_cs_43
We present an approach to utilize large amounts of web data for learning CNNs,Purpose,wos_cs_430
"Specifically inspired by curriculum learning , we present a two-step approach for CNN training",Mechanism,wos_cs_430
"First , we use easy images to train an initial visual representation",Mechanism,wos_cs_430
"We then use this initial CNN and adapt it to harder , more realistic images by leveraging the structure of data and categories",Mechanism,wos_cs_430
We demonstrate that our two-stage CNN outperforms a fine-tuned CNN trained,Findings,wos_cs_430
on ImageNet on Pascal VOC 2012,Method,wos_cs_430
We also demonstrate the strength of webly supervised learning,Findings,wos_cs_430
by localizing objects in web images and training a R-CNN style { [ } 19 ] detector,Method,wos_cs_430
It achieves the best performance on VOC 2007 where no VOC training data is used,Findings,wos_cs_430
"Finally , we show our approach is quite robust to noise and performs comparably even",Findings,wos_cs_430
"While feedforward deep convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) have been a great success in computer vision , it is important to note that the human visual cortex generally contains more feedback than feedforward connections",Background,wos_cs_435
"In this paper , we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex , which motivates us to develop",Purpose,wos_cs_435
a computational feedback mechanism in deep neural networks,Mechanism,wos_cs_435
"In addition to the feedforward inference in traditional neural networks , a feedback loop is introduced",Mechanism,wos_cs_435

Experiments on ImageNet dataset,Method,wos_cs_435
We present an approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_437
to capture the 3D structure and motion of a group of people engaged in a social interaction,Purpose,wos_cs_437
The core challenges in capturing social interactions are : ( 1 ) occlusion is functional and frequent ; ( 2 ) subtle motion needs to be measured over a space large enough to host a social group ; and ( 3 ) human appearance and configuration variation is immense,Background,wos_cs_437
Varied sources of error contribute to the challenge of facial action unit detection,Background,wos_cs_438
Previous approaches address specific and known sources,Background,wos_cs_438
"However , many sources are unknown",Background,wos_cs_438
"To address the ubiquity of error ,",Purpose,wos_cs_438
we propose a Confident Preserving Machine ( CPM ) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy,Mechanism,wos_cs_438
"During training , CPM learns two confident classifiers",Mechanism,wos_cs_438
A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else ; a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples,Mechanism,wos_cs_438
"During testing , CPM then learns a person-specific classifier using `` virtual labels { '' } provided by confident classifiers",Mechanism,wos_cs_438
This step is achieved using a quasi-semi-supervised ( QSS ) approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_438
"Hard samples are typically close to the decision boundary , and the QSS approach disambiguates them using spatio-temporal constraints",Mechanism,wos_cs_438
"To evaluate CPM , we compared it with a baseline single-margin classifier and state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning , transfer learning , and boosting methods in three datasets of spontaneous facial behavior",Method,wos_cs_438
Determining dense semantic correspondences across objects and scenes is a difficult problem that underpins many higher-level computer vision algorithms,Background,wos_cs_440
"Unlike canonical dense correspondence problems which consider images that are spatially or temporally adjacent , semantic correspondence is characterized by images that share similar high-level structures whose exact appearance and geometry may differ",Background,wos_cs_440
"Motivated by object recognition literature and recent work on rapidly estimating linear classifiers , we treat semantic correspondence as a constrained detection problem , where an exemplar LDA classifier is learned for each pixel",Purpose,wos_cs_440
Starting with the seminal work by Kempe et al,Background,wos_cs_441
", a broad variety of problems , such as targeted marketing and the spread of viruses and malware , have been modeled as selecting a subset of nodes to maximize diffusion through a network",Background,wos_cs_441
"In cyber-security applications , however , a key consideration largely ignored in this literature is stealth",Background,wos_cs_441
"In particular , an attacker often has a specific target in mind , but succeeds only if the target is reached ( e",Background,wos_cs_441
", by malware ) before the malicious payload is detected and corresponding countermeasures deployed",Background,wos_cs_441
"The dual side of this problem is deployment of a limited number of monitoring units , such as cyber-forensics specialists , so as to limit the likelihood of such targeted and stealthy diffusion processes reaching their intended targets",Background,wos_cs_441
"We investigate the problem of optimal monitoring of targeted stealthy diffusion processes , and",Purpose,wos_cs_441
show that a number of natural variants of this problem are NP-hard to approximate,Findings,wos_cs_441
"On the positive side , we show that if stealthy diffusion starts from randomly selected nodes , the defender 's objective is submodular , and a fast greedy algorithm has provable approximation guarantees",Findings,wos_cs_441
"In addition , we present approximation algorithms",Mechanism,wos_cs_441
for the setting in which an attacker optimally responds to the placement of monitoring nodes,Purpose,wos_cs_441
by adaptively selecting the starting nodes for the diffusion process,Mechanism,wos_cs_441

Poor spelling is a challenge faced by people with dyslexia throughout their lives,Background,wos_cs_446
"Spellcheckers are therefore a crucial tool for people with dyslexia , but current spellcheckers do not detect real-word errors , which are a common type of errors made by people with dyslexia",Background,wos_cs_446
"Real-word errors are spelling mistakes that result in an unintended but real word , for instance , form instead of from",Background,wos_cs_446
Nearly 20\ % of the errors that people with dyslexia make are real-word errors,Background,wos_cs_446
"In this paper , we introduce a system called Real Check that uses a probabilistic language model , a statistical dependency parser and Google n-grams",Mechanism,wos_cs_446
to detect real-world errors,Purpose,wos_cs_446
We evaluated Real Check on text written by people with dyslexia,Method,wos_cs_446
", and showed that it detects more of these errors than widely used spellcheckers",Findings,wos_cs_446

Large scale deployment of sensors is essential to practical applications in cyber physical systems,Background,wos_cs_449
"For instance , instrumenting a commercial building for `smart energy ' management requires deployment and operation of thousands of measurement and metering sensors and actuators that direct operation of the HVAC system",Background,wos_cs_449
Each of these sensors need to be named consistently and constantly calibrated,Background,wos_cs_449
"Doing this process manually is not only time consuming but also error prone given the scale , heterogeneity and complexity of buildings as well as lack of uniform naming schemas",Purpose,wos_cs_449
"To address this challenge ,",Purpose,wos_cs_449
we propose Zodiac-a framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_449
"for automatically classifying , naming and managing sensors",Purpose,wos_cs_449
based on active learning from sensor metadata,Mechanism,wos_cs_449
"In contrast to prior work , Zodiac requires minimal user input in terms of labelling examples while being more accurate",Mechanism,wos_cs_449
"To evaluate Zodiac , we deploy it across four real buildings on our campus and label the ground truth metadata for all the sensors in these buildings manually",Method,wos_cs_449
Using a combination of hierarchical clustering and random forest classifiers,Method,wos_cs_449
Modern cyber-physical systems interact closely with continuous physical processes like kinematic movement,Background,wos_cs_451
Software component frameworks do not provide an explicit way to represent or reason about these processes,Background,wos_cs_451
"Meanwhile , hybrid program models have been successful in proving critical properties of discrete-continuous systems",Background,wos_cs_451
"These programs deal with diverse aspects of a cyber-physical system such as controller decisions , component communication protocols , and mechanical dynamics , requiring several programs to address the variation",Background,wos_cs_451
"However , currently these aspects are often intertwined in mostly monolithic hybrid programs , which are difficult to understand , change , and organize",Background,wos_cs_451
"These issues can be addressed by component-based engineering , making hybrid modeling more practical",Purpose,wos_cs_451
This paper lays the foundation for using,Purpose,wos_cs_451
architectural models,Mechanism,wos_cs_451
to provide component-based benefits to developing hybrid programs,Purpose,wos_cs_451
"We build formal architectural abstractions of hybrid programs and formulas , enabling analysis of hybrid programs at the component level , reusing parts of hybrid programs , and automatic transformation from views into hybrid programs and formulas",Mechanism,wos_cs_451
Dependencies among software projects and libraries are an indicator of the often implicit collaboration among many developers in software ecosystems,Background,wos_cs_452
"Negotiating change can be tricky : changes to one module may cause ripple effects to many other modules that depend on it , yet insisting on only backward-compatible changes may incur significant opportunity cost and stifle change",Background,wos_cs_452
We argue that awareness mechanisms based on various notions of stability can enable developers to make decisions that are independent yet wise and provide stewardship rather than disruption to the ecosystem,Purpose,wos_cs_452
In ongoing interviews with developers in two software ecosystems ( CRAN and Node,Method,wos_cs_452
js ),Method,wos_cs_452
", we are finding that developers in fact struggle with change , that they often use adhoc mechanisms to negotiate change , and that existing awareness mechanisms like Github notification feeds are rarely used due to information overload",Findings,wos_cs_452

for discovering instances in which a response relation exists between a pair of posts in a forum thread,Purpose,wos_cs_453
", for example when one student provides the answer to a question or comments on something another student previously said",Mechanism,wos_cs_453
Research has shown that understanding conversational structure between students is paramount to evaluating the productivity of the collaboration and estimating outcomes,Background,wos_cs_453
"However , previous methods often rely on human supplied dialogue act labels or discourse parsing algorithms requiring large labeled datasets",Background,wos_cs_453

"This includes identity management , mapping and navigation , cloud storage , and advertising services , among others",Background,wos_cs_457
"While service reuse reduces development time , it introduces new privacy and security risks due to data repurposing and over-collection as data is shared among multiple parties who lack transparency into third-party data practices",Purpose,wos_cs_457

Regulatory definitions establish the scope and boundary for legal statements and provide software designers with means to assess the coverage of their designs under the law,Background,wos_cs_479
"However , the number of phrases that serve to define this boundary in a legal statement are usually large and often a simple legal statement contains or is affected by up to 10 definition-related phrases",Background,wos_cs_479

"The study presented here investigates different methods of displaying information about the swarm state to operators , and asks them to make predictions about the swarm 's future state",Purpose,wos_cs_52
"In the study , participants are shown swarms performing one of three different behaviors , and are asked to use the information available from the display to make their predictions",Method,wos_cs_52
Results show that summarizing the swarm 's current state to just an average position and bounding ellipse allowed predictions as accurate as those made when full state information was shown,Findings,wos_cs_52

"In many scenarios involving human interaction with a remote swarm , the human operator needs to be periodically updated with state information from the robotic swarm",Background,wos_cs_54
A complete representation of swarm state is high dimensional and perceptually inaccessible to the human,Background,wos_cs_54
"Thus , a summary representation is often required",Background,wos_cs_54
"In addition , it is often the case that the human-swarm communication channel is extremely bandwidth constrained and may have high latency",Background,wos_cs_54
This motivates the need for the swarm itself to compute a summary representation of its own state for transmission to the human operator,Background,wos_cs_54

Exploration of unknown environments is an important aspect to fielding teams of robots,Background,wos_cs_548

Both of them are very challenging,Background,wos_cs_560
Prior work in the literature has shown that inserting the human input as soon as possible to divert the swarm from its original goal towards the new goal does not always result in optimal performance ( measured by some criterion such as the total time required by the swarm to reach the second goal ),Background,wos_cs_560

Experience Graphs have been shown to accelerate motion planning using parts of previous paths in an A { * } framework,Background,wos_cs_564
Experience Graphs work by computing a new heuristic for weighted A { * } search on top of the domain 's original heuristic and the edges in an Experience Graph,Background,wos_cs_564

for interpreting the spatial relations,Purpose,wos_cs_570
", such as `` left of { '' } and `` near { '' }",Mechanism,wos_cs_570
The model is learned from examples provided by humans,Mechanism,wos_cs_570
"For each noun in the command , a distribution on the objects in the environment is computed by combining spatial constraints with a prior given as the semantic classifier 's confidence values",Mechanism,wos_cs_570
"The robot needs also to ground the navigation mode specified in the command , such as `` navigate quickly { '' } and `` navigate covertly { '' } , as a cost map",Mechanism,wos_cs_570
"The cost map is also learned from examples , using Inverse Optimal Control ( IOC )",Mechanism,wos_cs_570
The cost map and the grounded goal are used to generate a path for the robot,Mechanism,wos_cs_570
This approach is evaluated on a robot in a real-world environment,Method,wos_cs_570
"Here , we present a general framework",Mechanism,wos_cs_571
for combining visual odometry and lidar odometry,Purpose,wos_cs_571
in a fundamental and first principle method,Mechanism,wos_cs_571
"The method shows improvements in performance over the state of the art , particularly in robustness to aggressive motion and temporary lack of visual features",Findings,wos_cs_571
The proposed on-line method starts with visual odometry to estimate the ego-motion and to register point clouds from a scanning lidar at a high frequency but low fidelity,Mechanism,wos_cs_571
"Then , scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously",Mechanism,wos_cs_571
We show results,Findings,wos_cs_571
with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the KITTI odometry benchmark,Method,wos_cs_571

the problem of adapting a demonstrated trajectory to a new start and goal configuration,Purpose,wos_cs_572
as an optimization problem over a Hilbert space of trajectories : minimize the distance between the demonstration and the new trajectory subject to the new end point constraints,Mechanism,wos_cs_572
"We show that the commonly used version of Dynamic Movement Primitives ( DMPs ) implement this minimization in the way they adapt demonstrations , for a particular choice of the Hilbert space norm",Mechanism,wos_cs_572
The generalization to arbitrary norms,Mechanism,wos_cs_572
"enables the robot to select a more appropriate norm for the task , as well as learn how to adapt the demonstration from the user",Purpose,wos_cs_572

Many motion planning problems in robotics are high dimensional planning problems,Background,wos_cs_573
"While sampling-based motion planning algorithms handle the high dimensionality very well , the solution qualities are often hard to control due to the inherent randomization",Background,wos_cs_573
"In addition , they suffer severely when the configuration space has several `narrow passages '",Background,wos_cs_573
Search-based planners on the other hand typically provide good solution qualities and are not affected by narrow passages,Background,wos_cs_573
"However , in the absence of a good heuristic or when there are deep local minima in the heuristic , they suffer from the curse of dimensionality",Background,wos_cs_573
"In this work , our primary contribution is a method",Mechanism,wos_cs_573
"for dynamically generating heuristics ,",Purpose,wos_cs_573
"in addition to the original heuristic ( s ) used ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_573
to guide the search out of local minima,Purpose,wos_cs_573
"With the ability to escape local minima easily , the effect of dimensionality becomes less pronounced",Mechanism,wos_cs_573
"On the theoretical side , we provide guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality of the solution found",Purpose,wos_cs_573
"We compare our proposed method with the recently published Multi-Heuristic A { * } search , and the popular RRT-Connect in a full-body mobile manipulation domain for the PR2 robot ,",Method,wos_cs_573
Autonomous systems that navigate in unknown environments encounter a variety of planning problems,Background,wos_cs_574
"The success of any one particular planning strategy depends on the validity of assumptions it leverages about the structure of the problem , e",Purpose,wos_cs_574
", Is the cost map locally convex ? Does the feasible state space have good connectivity ? We address the problem of determining suitable motion planning strategies that can work on a diverse set of applications",Purpose,wos_cs_574
We have developed a planning system that does this by running competing planners in parallel,Mechanism,wos_cs_574
"In this paper , we present an approach that constructs a planner ensemble - a set of complementary planners that leverage a diverse set of assumptions",Mechanism,wos_cs_574
Our approach optimizes the submodular selection criteria with a greedy approach and lazy evaluation,Mechanism,wos_cs_574
"We seed our selection with learnt priors on planner performance , thus allowing us to solve new applications without evaluating every planner on that application",Mechanism,wos_cs_574
We present results,Findings,wos_cs_574
in simulation,Method,wos_cs_574
where the selected ensemble outperforms the best single planner and does almost as well as an off-line planner,Findings,wos_cs_574
We also present results,Findings,wos_cs_574
from an autonomous helicopter,Method,wos_cs_574
"that has flown missions several kilometers long at speeds of up to 56 ( m ) /s which involved avoiding unmapped mountains , no-fly zones and landing in cluttered areas with trees and buildings",Findings,wos_cs_574
We present a randomized kinodynamic planner,Mechanism,wos_cs_575
that solves rearrangement planning problems,Purpose,wos_cs_575
We embed a physics model into the planner to allow reasoning about interaction with objects in the environment,Mechanism,wos_cs_575
"By carefully selecting this model , we are able to reduce our state and action space , gaining tractability in the search",Mechanism,wos_cs_575
The result is a planner capable of generating trajectories for full arm manipulation and simultaneous object interaction,Mechanism,wos_cs_575
In this work we present a fast kinodynamic RRT-planner that uses dynamic nonprehensile actions,Mechanism,wos_cs_578
to rearrange cluttered environments,Purpose,wos_cs_578
"In contrast to many previous works , the presented planner is not restricted to quasi-static interactions and monotonicity",Mechanism,wos_cs_578
Instead the results of dynamic robot actions are predicted using a black box physics model,Mechanism,wos_cs_578
"Given a general set of primitive actions and a physics model , the planner randomly explores the configuration space of the environment to find a sequence of actions that transform the environment into some goal configuration",Mechanism,wos_cs_578
In contrast to a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner we show that we can exploit the physical fact that in an environment with friction any object eventually comes to rest,Mechanism,wos_cs_578
"This allows a search on the configuration space rather than the state space , reducing the dimension of the search space by a factor of two without restricting us to non-dynamic interactions",Mechanism,wos_cs_578
We compare our algorithm against a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner,Method,wos_cs_578
Modeling the effects of actions based on the state of the world enables robots to make intelligent decisions in different situations,Background,wos_cs_580
"However , it is often infeasible to have globally accurate models",Background,wos_cs_580
"Task performance is often hindered by discrepancies between models and the real world , since the 1 outcome of executing a plan may be significantly worse than the expected outcome used during planning",Background,wos_cs_580
"Furthermore , expectations about the world are often stochastic in robotics , making the discovery of model-world discrepancies non-trivial",Background,wos_cs_580
We present an execution monitoring framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_580
"capable of finding statistically significant discrepancies , determining the situations in which they occur , and making simple corrections to the world model to improve performance",Purpose,wos_cs_580
"In our approach , plans are initially based on a model of the world that is only as faithful as computational and algorithmic limitations allow",Mechanism,wos_cs_580
"Through experience , the monitor discovers previously unmodeled modes of the world , defined as regions of a feature space in which the experienced outcome of a plan deviates significantly from the predicted outcome",Mechanism,wos_cs_580
The monitor may then make suggestions to change the model to match the real world more accurately,Mechanism,wos_cs_580
The goal of this paper is to develop a regrasp planning algorithm general enough,Mechanism,wos_cs_585
to perform statistical analysis with thousands of experiments and arbitrary mesh models,Purpose,wos_cs_585
We focus on pick-and-place regrasp which reorients an object from one placement to another by using a sequence of pickups and place-downs,Mechanism,wos_cs_585
We improve the pick-and-place regrasp approach developed in 1990s and analyze its performance in robotic assembly with different work surfaces in the workcell,Mechanism,wos_cs_585
"Our algorithm will automatically compute the stable placements of an object , find several force-closure grasps , generate a graph of regrasp actions , and search for regrasp sequences",Mechanism,wos_cs_585
We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm,Findings,wos_cs_585
"with various mesh models and use the algorithm to evaluate the completeness , the cost and the length of regrasp sequences with different mesh models and different assembly tasks in the presence of different work surfaces",Method,wos_cs_585
Simultaneous localization and mapping with infinite planes is attractive because of the reduced complexity with respect to both sparse point-based and dense volumetric methods,Background,wos_cs_586
"We show how to include infinite planes into a least-squares formulation for mapping ,",Purpose,wos_cs_586
using a homogeneous plane parametrization with a corresponding minimal representation for the optimization,Mechanism,wos_cs_586

We develop a computationally efficient control policy for active perception that incorporates explicit models of sensing and mobility,Mechanism,wos_cs_587
to build 3D maps with ground and aerial robots,Purpose,wos_cs_587
"Like previous work , our policy maximizes an information-theoretic objective function between the discrete occupancy belief distribution ( e",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
", voxel grid ) and future measurements that can be made by mobile sensors",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"However , our work is unique in three ways",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"First , we show that by using Cauchy-Schwarz Quadratic Mutual Information ( CSQMI ) , we get significant gains in efficiency",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"Second , while most previous methods adopt a myopic , gradient-following approach that yields poor convergence properties , our algorithm searches over a set of paths and is less susceptible to local minima",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"In doing so , we explicitly incorporate models of sensors , and model the dependence ( and independence ) of measurements over multiple time steps in a path",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"Third , because we consider models of sensing and mobility , our method naturally applies to both ground and aerial vehicles",Mechanism,wos_cs_587
"The paper describes the basic models , the problem formulation and the algorithm , and",Purpose,wos_cs_587
demonstrates applications,Findings,wos_cs_587
"With the prevalence of social media , such as Twitter , short-length text like microblogs have become an important mode of text on the Internet",Background,wos_cs_59
"In contrast to other forms of media , such as newspaper , the text in these social media posts usually contains fewer words , and is concentrated on a much narrower selection of topics",Background,wos_cs_59
"For these reasons , traditional LDA-based sentiment and topic modeling techniques generally do not work well in case of social media data",Background,wos_cs_59
"Another characteristic feature of this data is the use of special meta tokens , such as hashtags , which contain unique semantic meanings that are not captured by other ordinary words",Background,wos_cs_59
"In the recent years , many topic modeling techniques have been proposed for social media data , but the majority of this work does not take into account the specialty of tokens , such as hashtags , and treats them as ordinary words",Purpose,wos_cs_59
"In this paper , we propose probabilistic graphical models",Mechanism,wos_cs_59
"to address the problem of discovering latent topics and their sentiment from social media data , mainly microblogs like Twitter",Purpose,wos_cs_59
"We first propose MTM ( Microblog Topic Model ) , a generative model that assumes each social media post generates from a single topic , and models both words and hashtags separately",Mechanism,wos_cs_59
"We then propose MSTM ( Microblog Sentiment Topic Model ) , an extension of MTM , which also embodies the sentiment associated with the topics",Mechanism,wos_cs_59
There have been increasing interests in the robotics community in building smaller and more agile autonomous micro aerial vehicles ( MAVs ),Background,wos_cs_590
"In particular , the monocular visual-inertial system ( VINS ) that consists of only a camera and an inertial measurement unit ( IMU ) forms a great minimum sensor suite due to its superior size , weight , and power ( SWaP ) characteristics",Purpose,wos_cs_590
"In this paper , we present a tightly-coupled nonlinear optimization-based monocular VINS estimator for autonomous rotorcraft MAVs",Mechanism,wos_cs_590
Our estimator allows the MAV to execute trajectories at 2 m/s with roll and pitch angles up to 30 degrees,Mechanism,wos_cs_590
"Learning from demonstration ( LfD ) is a common technique applied to many problems in robotics , such as populating grasp databases , training for reinforcement learning of high-level skill sets and bootstrapping motion planners",Background,wos_cs_593
"While such approaches are generally highly valued , they rely on the often time-consuming process of gathering user demonstrations , and hence it becomes difficult to attain a sizeable dataset",Purpose,wos_cs_593
"In this paper , we present a tool capable of recording large numbers of high-dimensional demonstrations of mobile manipulation tasks provided by non-experts in the field",Mechanism,wos_cs_593
"Our tool accomplishes this via a web interface that requires no additional software to be installed beyond a web browser , as well as a scalable architecture that is capable of supporting 10 concurrent demonstrators on a single server",Mechanism,wos_cs_593
Our architecture employs a lightweight simulation environment to reduce unnecessary computations and improve performance,Mechanism,wos_cs_593
"Furthermore , we show how our tool can be used to gather a large set of demonstrations of a mobile manipulation task by leveraging existing crowdsource platforms",Purpose,wos_cs_593

It is imperative to guarantee safety of such systems for their successful deployment,Background,wos_cs_600
Current state of the art does not fully exploit the sensor and dynamic capabilities of a robot,Background,wos_cs_600

This paper considers the problem of server nan scheduling for jobs composed of multiple pieces with consecutive ( progressive ) deadlines,Purpose,wos_cs_601
"One example is server-side scheduling for video service , where clients request flows of content from a server with limited capacity , and any content not delivered by its deadline is lost",Background,wos_cs_601
"We consider the simultaneous goals of 1 ) minimizing overall loss , and 2 ) differentiating loss fractions across classes of flows in proportion to relative weights",Purpose,wos_cs_601
"State-of-the-art policies , like Discriminatory Processor Sharing and Weighted Fair Queueing , use a fixed static proportional allocation of service rate and fail to achieve both goals",Background,wos_cs_601

Automated visual analysis is an effective method for understanding changes in natural phenomena over massive city-scale landscapes,Background,wos_cs_631
"However , the view-point spectrum across which image data can be acquired is extremely wide , ranging from macro-level overhead ( aerial ) images spanning several kilometers to micro-level front-parallel ( street-view ) images that might only span a few meters",Purpose,wos_cs_631
This work presents a unified framework for robustly integrating image data taken at vastly different viewpoints,Mechanism,wos_cs_631
to generate large-scale estimates of land surface conditions,Purpose,wos_cs_631
"To validate our approach we attempt to estimate the amount of post-Tsunami damage over the entire city of Kamaishi , Japan ( over 4 million square-meters )",Method,wos_cs_631
"Our results show that our approach can efficiently integrate both micro and macro-level images , along with other forms of meta-data , to efficiently estimate city-scale phenomena",Findings,wos_cs_631
"We evaluate our approach on two modes of land condition analysis , namely , city-scale debris and greenery estimation ,",Method,wos_cs_631
Computer vision is increasingly becoming interested in the rapid estimation of object detectors,Background,wos_cs_632
"The canonical strategy of using Hard Negative Mining to train a Support Vector Machine is slow , since the large negative set must be traversed at least once per detector",Background,wos_cs_632
"Recent work has demonstrated that , with an assumption of signal stationarity , Linear Discriminant Analysis is able to learn comparable detectors without ever revisiting the negative set",Background,wos_cs_632
"Even with this insight , the time to learn a detector can still be on the order of minutes",Background,wos_cs_632
"Correlation filters , on the other hand , can produce a detector in under a second",Background,wos_cs_632
"However , this involves the unnatural assumption that the statistics are periodic , and requires the negative set to be re-sampled per detector size",Background,wos_cs_632
These two methods differ chiefly in the structure which they impose on the covariance matrix of all examples,Background,wos_cs_632
This paper is,Purpose,wos_cs_632
a comparative study,Method,wos_cs_632
which develops techniques,Mechanism,wos_cs_632
( i ) to assume periodic statistics without needing to revisit the negative set and ( ii ) to accelerate the estimation of detectors with aperiodic statistics,Purpose,wos_cs_632
It is experimentally,Method,wos_cs_632
Given the re-broadcasts ( i,Background,wos_cs_634

"retweets ) of posts in Twitter , how can we spot fake from genuine user reactions ? What will be the tell-tale sign - the connectivity of retweeters , their relative timing , or something else ? High retweet activity indicates influential users , and can be monetized",Background,wos_cs_634
"Hence , there are strong incentives for fraudulent users to artificially boost their retweets ' volume",Background,wos_cs_634
"Here , we explore the identification of fraudulent and genuine retweet threads",Purpose,wos_cs_634
"Our main contributions are : ( a ) the discovery of patterns that fraudulent activity seems to follow ( the `` triangles { '' } and `` homogeneity { '' } patterns , the formation of micro-clusters in appropriate feature spaces ) ; and (",Findings,wos_cs_634
"b ) `` RTGen { '' } , a realistic generator that mimics the behaviors of both honest and fraudulent users",Mechanism,wos_cs_634
"Given the retweeting activity for the posts of several Twitter users ,",Background,wos_cs_636
"how can we distinguish organic activity from spammy retweets by paid followers to boost a post 's appearance of popularity ? More generally , given groups of observations , can we spot strange groups ? Our main intuition is that organic behavior has more variability , while fraudulent behavior , like retweets by botnet members , is more synchronized",Purpose,wos_cs_636
"We refer to the detection of such synchronized observations as the Synchonization Fraud problem , and we study a specific instance of it , Retweet Fraud Detection , manifested in Twitter",Method,wos_cs_636
"Here , we propose : ( A ) ND-Sync , an efficient method for detecting group fraud , and ( B ) a set of carefully designed features for characterizing retweet threads",Mechanism,wos_cs_636
"ND-Sync is effective in spotting retweet fraudsters , robust to different types of abnormal activity , and adaptable as it can easily incorporate additional features",Mechanism,wos_cs_636
"This paper presents a novel descriptor , geodesic invariant feature ( GIF ) ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
for representing objects in depth images,Purpose,wos_cs_637
"Especially in the context of parts classification of articulated objects , it is capable of encoding the invariance of local structures effectively and efficiently",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
The contributions of this paper lie in our multi-level feature extraction hierarchy,Mechanism,wos_cs_637
( 1 ) Low-level feature encodes the invariance to articulation,Mechanism,wos_cs_637
"Geodesic gradient is introduced , which is covariant with the non-rigid deformation of objects and is utilized to rectify the feature extraction process",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
( 2 ) Mid-level feature reduces the noise and improves the efficiency,Mechanism,wos_cs_637
"With unsupervised clustering , the primitives of objects are changed from pixels to superpixels",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
"The benefit is two-fold : firstly , superpixel reduces the effect of the noise introduced by depth sensors ; secondly , the processing speed can be improved by a big margin",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
( 3 ) High-level feature captures nonlinear dependencies between the dimensions,Mechanism,wos_cs_637
Deep network is utilized to discover the high-level feature representation,Mechanism,wos_cs_637
"As the feature propagates towards the deeper layers of the network , the ability of the feature capturing the data 's underlying regularities is improved",Mechanism,wos_cs_637
Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods,Method,wos_cs_637
"Ensemble methods for classification have been effectively used for decades , while for outlier detection it has only been studied recently",Background,wos_cs_64
"In this work , we design a new ensemble approach",Mechanism,wos_cs_64
"for outlier detection in multi-dimensional point data ,",Purpose,wos_cs_64
which provides improved accuracy by reducing error through both bias and variance by considering outlier detection as a binary classification task with unobserved labels,Mechanism,wos_cs_64
"In this paper , we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that employs a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration to reach the final outcome",Mechanism,wos_cs_64
"Unlike existing outlier ensembles , our ensemble incorporates both the parallel and sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by ( i ) successively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better data model on which outlierness is estimated ( sequentially ) , and ( ii ) combining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations ( parallelly )",Mechanism,wos_cs_64
"Through extensive experiments on 16 real-world datasets mainly from the UCI machine learning repository { [ } 1 ] ,",Method,wos_cs_64
An active learning method,Mechanism,wos_cs_641
for identifying drug-target interactions,Purpose,wos_cs_641
is presented which considers the interaction between multiple drugs and multiple targets at the same time,Mechanism,wos_cs_641
"The goal of the proposed method is not simply to predict such interactions from experiments that have already been conducted , but to iteratively choose as few new experiments as possible to improve the accuracy of the predictive model",Purpose,wos_cs_641
Kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization ( KBMF ) is used to model the interactions,Mechanism,wos_cs_641
We demonstrate on four previously characterized drug effect data sets,Method,wos_cs_641
"that active learning driven experimentation using KBMF can result in highly accurate models while performing as few as 14\ % of the possible experiments , and more accurately than random sampling of an equivalent number",Findings,wos_cs_641
We also provide a method,Mechanism,wos_cs_641
for estimating the accuracy of the current model,Purpose,wos_cs_641
based on the learning curve ;,Mechanism,wos_cs_641
In this paper we present a method,Mechanism,wos_cs_642
to improve the automatic detection of events in short sentences when in the presence of a large number of event classes,Purpose,wos_cs_642
"This paper presents a theoretical and experimental comparison of sound proof rules for proving invariance of algebraic sets , that is , sets satisfying polynomial equalities , under the flow of polynomial ordinary differential equations",Purpose,wos_cs_645
"Problems of this nature arise in formal verification of continuous and hybrid dynamical systems , where there is an increasing need for methods to expedite formal proofs",Background,wos_cs_645
We study the trade-off between proof rule generality and practical performance and evaluate our theoretical observations on a set of heterogeneous benchmarks,Method,wos_cs_645
The segmentation is the first step and core technology for semantic understanding of the video,Background,wos_cs_646
"Many tasks in the computer vision such as tracking , recognition and 3D reconstruction , etc",Background,wos_cs_646
rely on the segmentation result as preprocessing,Background,wos_cs_646
"However , the video segmentation has been known to be a very complicated and hard problem",Background,wos_cs_646
"The objects in the video change their colors and shapes according to the surrounding illumination , the camera position , or the object motion",Background,wos_cs_646
"The color , motion , or depth has been utilized individually as a key clue for the segmentation in many researches",Background,wos_cs_646
"However , every object in the image is composed of several features such as color , texture , depth and motion",Purpose,wos_cs_646
That is why single-feature based segmentation method often fails,Purpose,wos_cs_646
"Humans can segment the objects in video with ease because the human visual system enables to consider color , texture , depth and motion at the same time",Purpose,wos_cs_646
"In this paper , we propose the video segmentation algorithm which is motivated by the human visual system",Mechanism,wos_cs_646
"The algorithm performs the video segmentation task by simultaneously utilizing the color histogram of the color , the optical flow of the motion , and the homography of the structure",Mechanism,wos_cs_646
Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other appearance based segmentation method in terms of semantic quality of the segmentation { [ } 15 ],Findings,wos_cs_646
Many data structures ( e,Background,wos_cs_648
", matrices ) are typically accessed with multiple access patterns",Background,wos_cs_648
"Depending on the layout of the data structure in physical address space , some access patterns result in non-unit strides",Background,wos_cs_648
"In existing systems , which are optimized to store and access cache lines , non-unit strided accesses exhibit low spatial locality",Background,wos_cs_648
"Therefore , they incur high latency , and waste memory bandwidth and cache space",Purpose,wos_cs_648
We propose the Gather-Scatter DRAM ( GS-DRAM ),Mechanism,wos_cs_648
to address this problem,Purpose,wos_cs_648
We observe that a commodity DRAM module contains many chips,Mechanism,wos_cs_648
Each chip stores a part of every cache line mapped to the module,Mechanism,wos_cs_648
Our idea is to enable the memory controller to access multiple values that belong to a strided pattern from different chips using a single read/write command,Purpose,wos_cs_648
"To realize this idea , GS-DRAM first maps the data of each cache line to different chips such that multiple values of a strided access pattern are mapped to different chips",Mechanism,wos_cs_648
"Second , instead of sending a separate address to each chip , GS-DRAM maps each strided pattern to a small pattern ID that is communicated to the module",Mechanism,wos_cs_648
"Based on the pattern ID , each chip independently computes the address of the value to be accessed",Mechanism,wos_cs_648
The cache line returned by the module contains different values of the strided pattern gathered from different chips,Mechanism,wos_cs_648
We show that this approach enables GS-DRAM to achieve near-ideal memory bandwidth and cache utilization for many common access patterns,Findings,wos_cs_648
We design an end-to-end system to exploit GS-DRAM,Method,wos_cs_648
"Our evaluations show that 1 ) for in-memory databases , GS-DRAM obtains the best of the row store and the column store layouts , in terms of both performance and energy , and 2 ) for matrix-matrix multiplication , GS-DRAM seamlessly enables SIMD optimizations and outperforms the best tiled layout",Findings,wos_cs_648
"Though most would agree that accountability and privacy are both valuable , today 's Internet provides little support for either",Background,wos_cs_649
"Previous efforts have explored ways to offer stronger guarantees for one of the two , typically at the expense of the other ; indeed , at first glance accountability and privacy appear mutually exclusive",Background,wos_cs_649
"At the center of the tussle is the source address : in an accountable Internet , source addresses undeniably link packets and senders so hosts can be punished for bad behavior",Purpose,wos_cs_649
"In a privacy-preserving Internet , source addresses are hidden as much as possible",Purpose,wos_cs_649
"In this paper , we argue that a balance is possible",Purpose,wos_cs_649
The growing number of sensor-based interactive applications and services are pushing the limits of the on-board computing resources in vehicles,Background,wos_cs_65
"With vehicles increasingly being connected to the Internet , offloading the computation to cloud-computing infrastructures is an attractive solution",Background,wos_cs_65
"However , the large sensory data inputs of interactive applications makes offloading challenging across dynamic network conditions , and different application requirements or policies",Purpose,wos_cs_65
"To address this challenge ,",Purpose,wos_cs_65
we design a system,Mechanism,wos_cs_65
to adaptively offload specific vehicular application components or modules,Purpose,wos_cs_65
to the cloud,Mechanism,wos_cs_65
We particularly develop heuristic mechanisms for the placement and scheduling of modules on the On-Board Unit ( OBU ) and a cloud server under dynamic networking conditions during driving,Mechanism,wos_cs_65
Through an experimental evaluation of the end-end application response time using our prototype vehicular cloud offloading system,Method,wos_cs_65
"This paper describes the design and implementation of HERD , a key-value system designed",Mechanism,wos_cs_650
to make the best use of an RDMA network,Purpose,wos_cs_650
"Unlike prior RDMA-based key-value systems , HERD focuses its design on reducing network round trips while using efficient RDMA primitives ; the result is substantially lower latency , and throughput that saturates modern , commodity RDMA hardware",Mechanism,wos_cs_650
"HERD has two unconventional decisions : First , it does not use RDMA reads , despite the allure of operations that bypass the remote CPU entirely",Mechanism,wos_cs_650
"Second , it uses a mix of RDMA and messaging verbs , despite the conventional wisdom that the messaging primitives are slow",Mechanism,wos_cs_650
A HERD client writes its request into the server 's memory ; the server computes the reply,Mechanism,wos_cs_650
This design uses a single round trip for all requests and,Mechanism,wos_cs_650
supports up to 26 million key-value operations per second with 5 mu s average latency,Findings,wos_cs_650
"Notably , for small key-value items , our full system throughput is similar to native RDMA read throughput and is over 2X higher than recent RDMA-based key-value systems",Findings,wos_cs_650
TTL caching models have recently regained significant research interest due to their connection to popular caching policies such as LRU,Background,wos_cs_652
This paper advances the state-of-the-art analysis of TTL-based cache networks by,Purpose,wos_cs_652
developing two exact methods with orthogonal generality and computational complexity,Mechanism,wos_cs_652
"The first method generalizes existing results for line networks under renewal requests to the broad class of caching policies whereby evictions are driven by stopping times ; in addition to classical policies used in DNS and web caching , our stopping time model captures an emerging new policy implemented in SON switches and Amazon web services",Mechanism,wos_cs_652
The second method further generalizes these results to feedforward networks with Markov arrival process ( MAP ) requests,Mechanism,wos_cs_652
"MAPs are particularly suitable for non-line networks because they are closed not only under superposition and splitting , as known , but also under caching operations with phase-type ( PH ) TTL distributions",Mechanism,wos_cs_652
The crucial benefit of the two closure properties is that they jointly enable the first exact analysis of TTL feedforward cache networks in great generality,Mechanism,wos_cs_652
"Moreover , numerical",Method,wos_cs_652
"To date , the study of dispatching or load balancing in server farms has primarily focused on the minimization of response time",Background,wos_cs_653
"Server farms are typically modeled by a front-end router that employs a dispatching policy to route jobs to one of several servers , with each server scheduling all the jobs in its queue via Processor-Sharing",Background,wos_cs_653
"However , the common assumption has been that all jobs are equally important or valuable , in that they are equally sensitive to delay",Purpose,wos_cs_653
Our work departs from this assumption,Purpose,wos_cs_653
": we model each arrival as having a randomly distributed value parameter , independent of the arrival 's service requirement ( job size )",Mechanism,wos_cs_653
"Given such value heterogeneity , the correct metric is no longer the minimization or response time , but rather , the minimization of value-weighted response time",Mechanism,wos_cs_653
"In this context , we ask `` what is a good dispatching policy to minimize the value-weighted response time metric ?",Purpose,wos_cs_653
{ '' } We propose a number of new dispatching policies that are motivated by the goal of minimizing the value-weighted response time,Mechanism,wos_cs_653
"Via a combination of exact analysis , asymptotic analysis , and simulation",Method,wos_cs_653
We have designed a new logic programming language called LM ( Linear Meld ),Mechanism,wos_cs_654
for programming graph- based algorithms in a declarative fashion,Purpose,wos_cs_654
"Our language is based on linear logic , an expressive logical system where logical facts can be consumed",Mechanism,wos_cs_654
"Because LM integrates both classical and linear logic ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_654
LM tends to be more expressive than other logic programming languages,Findings,wos_cs_654
LM programs are naturally concurrent,Findings,wos_cs_654
because facts are partitioned by nodes of a graph data structure,Mechanism,wos_cs_654
Computation is performed at the node level while communication happens between connected nodes,Mechanism,wos_cs_654
"In this paper , we present the syntax and operational semantics of our language and",Purpose,wos_cs_654
illustrate its use,Findings,wos_cs_654
It is hard to efficiently model the light transport in scenes with translucent objects for interactive applications,Background,wos_cs_655
"The inter-reflection between objects and their environments and the subsurface scattering through the materials intertwine to produce visual effects like color bleeding , light glows , and soft shading",Background,wos_cs_655
"Monte-Carlo based approaches have demonstrated impressive results but are computationally expensive , and faster approaches model either only inter-reflection or only subsurface scattering",Purpose,wos_cs_655
"In this paper , we present a simple analytic model that combines diffuse inter-reflection and isotropic subsurface scattering",Mechanism,wos_cs_655
Our approach extends the classical work in radiosity by including a subsurface scattering matrix that operates in conjunction with the traditional form factor matrix,Mechanism,wos_cs_655
"This subsurface scattering matrix can be constructed using analytic , measurement-based or simulation-based models and can capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous translucencies",Mechanism,wos_cs_655
Using a fast iterative solution to radiosity,Method,wos_cs_655
Motivation : Discovering the transcriptional regulatory architecture of the metabolism has been an important topic to understand the implications of transcriptional fluctuations on metabolism,Background,wos_cs_656
"The reporter algorithm ( RA ) was proposed to determine the hot spots in metabolic networks , around which transcriptional regulation is focused owing to a disease or a genetic perturbation",Background,wos_cs_656
"Using a z-score-based scoring scheme , RA calculates the average statistical change in the expression levels of genes that are neighbors to a target metabolite in the metabolic network",Background,wos_cs_656
The RA approach has been used in numerous studies to analyze cellular responses to the downstream genetic changes,Background,wos_cs_656
"In this article , we propose a mutual information-based multivariate reporter algorithm ( MIRA )",Mechanism,wos_cs_656
"with the goal of eliminating the following problems in detecting reporter metabolites : ( i ) conventional statistical methods suffer from small sample sizes , ( ii ) as z-score ranges from minus to plus infinity , calculating average scores can lead to canceling out opposite effects and ( iii ) analyzing genes one by one , then aggregating results can lead to information loss",Purpose,wos_cs_656
MIRA is a multivariate and combinatorial algorithm,Mechanism,wos_cs_656
that calculates the aggregate transcriptional response around a metabolite,Purpose,wos_cs_656
using mutual information,Mechanism,wos_cs_656
"We show that MIRA 's results are biologically sound , empirically significant and more reliable than RA",Findings,wos_cs_656
Results :,Findings,wos_cs_656
We apply MIRA to gene expression analysis of six knockout strains of Escherichia coli,Method,wos_cs_656
and show that MIRA captures the underlying metabolic dynamics of the switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration,Findings,wos_cs_656
We also apply MIRA to an Autism Spectrum Disorder gene expression dataset,Method,wos_cs_656
Results indicate that MIRA reports metabolites that highly overlap with recently found metabolic biomarkers in the autism literature,Findings,wos_cs_656
The aim of AEMINIUM is to study the implications of having a concurrent-by-default programming language,Purpose,wos_cs_657

AEMINIUM leverages the permission flow of object and group permissions through the program to validate the program 's correctness and to automatically infer a possible parallelization strategy via a dataflow graph,Mechanism,wos_cs_657
AEMINIUM supports not only fork-join parallelism but more general dataflow patterns of parallelism,Mechanism,wos_cs_657
"In this paper we present a formal system , called mu AEMINIUM , modeling the core concepts of AEMINIUM",Mechanism,wos_cs_657
mu AEMINIUM 's static type system is based on Featherweight Java with AEMINIUM-specific extensions,Mechanism,wos_cs_657
Besides checking for correctness AEMINIUM 's type system it also uses the permission flow to compute a potential parallel execution strategy for the program,Mechanism,wos_cs_657
mu AEMINIUM 's dynamic semantics use a concurrent-by-default evaluation approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_657
Along with the formal system we present its soundness proof,Method,wos_cs_657
We provide a full description of the implementation along with the description of various optimization techniques we used,Method,wos_cs_657
"We implemented AEMINIUM as an extension of the Plaid programming language , which has first-class support for permissions built-in",Method,wos_cs_657
The AEMINIUM implementation and all case studies are publicly available under the General Public License,Findings,wos_cs_657
We use various case studies to evaluate AEMINIUM 's applicability and,Method,wos_cs_657
to demonstrate that AEMINIUM parallelized code has performance improvements compared to its sequential counterpart,Findings,wos_cs_657
"We chose to use case studies from common domains or problems that are known to benefit from parallelization ,",Method,wos_cs_657
to show that AEMINIUM is powerful enough to encode them,Findings,wos_cs_657
"We demonstrate through a webserver application , which evaluates AEMINIUM 's impact on latency-bound applications , that",Method,wos_cs_657
AEMINIUM can achieve a 70\ % performance improvement over the sequential counterpart,Findings,wos_cs_657
In another case study we chose to implement a dictionary function to evaluate AEMINIUM 's capabilities to express essential data structures,Method,wos_cs_657
Our evaluation demonstrates that AEMINIUM can be used to express parallelism in such data-structures and that the performance benefits scale with the amount of annotation effort which is put into the implementation,Findings,wos_cs_657
We chose an integral computationally example to evaluate pure functional programming and computational intensive use cases,Method,wos_cs_657
Our experiments show that AEMINIUM is capable of extracting parallelism from functional code and achieving performance improvements up to the limits of Plaid 's inherent performance bounds,Findings,wos_cs_657
"Vehicular multi-hop protocols typically employ distance-based metrics ,",Background,wos_cs_66
which do not capture the complexity of vehicular connectivity,Purpose,wos_cs_66
"In this work we present LASP , a geographic protocol that uses a more accurate spatial connectivity-based metric",Mechanism,wos_cs_66
Spatial connectivity describes the historical probability of successfully delivering a packet from one geographic area to another,Mechanism,wos_cs_66
"Analysis of data collected from a vehicular testbed showed that , unlike other metrics , spatial connectivity indirectly captures all major factors affecting wireless connectivity",Mechanism,wos_cs_66
"Moreover , it is temporally stable , which makes it useful in estimating the quality of future co-located links",Mechanism,wos_cs_66
"When forwarding , LASP uses spatial connectivity information to pick a well-connected geographic forwarding zone , inside which multiple nodes cooperate in relaying through a distributed prioritization scheme",Mechanism,wos_cs_66
"Compared with other techniques where the sender picks a specific next hop relay , cooperative forwarding improves resilience to losses through vehicle diversity",Mechanism,wos_cs_66
"We evaluated LASP on a 30-node testbed ,",Method,wos_cs_66
Security requirements patterns represent reusable security practices that software engineers can apply to improve security in their system,Background,wos_cs_661
"Reusing best practices that others have employed could have a number of benefits , such as decreasing the time spent in the requirements elicitation process or improving the quality of the product by reducing product failure risk",Background,wos_cs_661
Pattern selection can be difficult due to the diversity of applicable patterns from which an analyst has to choose,Background,wos_cs_661
The challenge is that identifying the most appropriate pattern for a situation can be cumbersome and time-consuming,Purpose,wos_cs_661
We propose a new method that combines an inquiry-cycle based approach with the feature diagram notation,Mechanism,wos_cs_661
to review only relevant patterns and quickly select the most appropriate patterns for the situation,Purpose,wos_cs_661
"Similar to patterns themselves , our approach captures expert knowledge",Mechanism,wos_cs_661
to relate patterns based on decisions made by the pattern user,Purpose,wos_cs_661
"The resulting pattern hierarchies allow users to be guided through these decisions by questions , which introduce related patterns in order",Mechanism,wos_cs_661
to help the pattern user select the most appropriate patterns for their situation,Purpose,wos_cs_661
", thus resulting in better requirement generation",Mechanism,wos_cs_661
Government laws and regulations increasingly place requirements on software systems,Background,wos_cs_662
"Ideally , experts trained in law will analyze and interpret legal texts to inform the software requirements process",Background,wos_cs_662
"However , in small companies and development teams with short launch cycles , individuals with little or no legal training will be responsible for compliance",Background,wos_cs_662
"Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts are deciding if their system is covered by a law , and then deciding whether two legal requirements are similar or different",Background,wos_cs_662
"In this study , we assess the ability of laypersons , technical professionals , and legal experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and requirements",Purpose,wos_cs_662
"In so doing , we discovered that legal experts achieved higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when judging coverage conditions than requirements ,",Findings,wos_cs_662
measured by Fleiss ' K,Method,wos_cs_662
"When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen 's Kappa ,",Method,wos_cs_662
"Many traditional challenges in reconstructing 3D motion , such as matching across wide baselines and handling occlusion , reduce in significance as the number of unique viewpoints increases",Background,wos_cs_665
"However , to obtain this benefit , a new challenge arises : estimating precisely which cameras observe which points at each instant in time",Purpose,wos_cs_665
We present a maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimate of the time-varying visibility of the target points,Mechanism,wos_cs_665
to reconstruct the 3D motion of an event from a large number of cameras,Purpose,wos_cs_665
"Our algorithm takes , as input , camera poses and image sequences , and outputs the time-varying set of the cameras in which a target patch is visibile and its reconstructed trajectory",Mechanism,wos_cs_665
"We model visibility estimation as a MAP estimate by incorporating various cues including photometric consistency , motion consistency , and geometric consistency , in conjunction with a prior that rewards consistent visibilities in proximal cameras",Mechanism,wos_cs_665
An optimal estimate of visibility is obtained by finding the minimum cut of a capacitated graph over cameras,Mechanism,wos_cs_665
"Curse of dimensionality is a practical and challenging problem in image categorization , especially in cases with a large number of classes",Background,wos_cs_668
Multi-class classification encounters severe computational and storage problems when dealing with these large scale tasks,Background,wos_cs_668
"In this paper , we propose hierarchical feature hashing",Mechanism,wos_cs_668
"to effectively reduce dimensionality of parameter space without sacrificing classification accuracy , and at the same time exploit information in semantic taxonomy among categories",Purpose,wos_cs_668
We provide detailed theoretical analysis on our proposed hashing method,Method,wos_cs_668
"Moreover , experimental results on object recognition and scene classification",Method,wos_cs_668
"With the widespread availability of video cameras , we are facing an ever-growing enormous collection of unedited and unstructured video data",Background,wos_cs_669
"Due to lack of an automatic way to generate summaries from this large collection of consumer videos , they can be tedious and time consuming to index or search",Background,wos_cs_669
"In this work , we propose online video highlighting , a principled way",Mechanism,wos_cs_669
of generating short video summarizing the most important and interesting contents of an unedited and unstructured video,Purpose,wos_cs_669
", costly both time-wise and financially for manual processing",Mechanism,wos_cs_669
"Specifically , our method learns a dictionary from given video using group sparse coding , and updates atoms in the dictionary on-the-fly",Mechanism,wos_cs_669
A summary video is then generated by combining segments that can not be sparsely reconstructed using the learned dictionary,Mechanism,wos_cs_669
The online fashion of our proposed method enables it to process arbitrarily long videos and start generating summaries before seeing the end of the video,Mechanism,wos_cs_669
"Moreover , the processing time required by our proposed method is close to the original video length , achieving quasi real-time summarization speed",Mechanism,wos_cs_669
"Theoretical analysis , together with experimental results on more than 12 hours of surveillance and YouTube videos are provided ,",Method,wos_cs_669
"This paper poses object category detection in images as a type of 2D-to-3D alignment problem ,",Purpose,wos_cs_672
utilizing the large quantities of 3D CAD models that have been made publicly available online,Method,wos_cs_672
Using the `` chair { '' } class as a running example,Method,wos_cs_672
", we propose an exemplar-based 3D category representation , which can explicitly model chairs of different styles as well as the large variation in viewpoint",Mechanism,wos_cs_672
We develop an approach,Mechanism,wos_cs_672
to establish part-based correspondences between 3D CAD models and real photographs,Purpose,wos_cs_672
"This is achieved by ( i ) representing each 3D model using a set of view-dependent mid-level visual elements learned from synthesized views in a discriminative fashion , ( ii ) carefully calibrating the individual element detectors on a common dataset of negative images , and ( iii ) matching visual elements to the test image allowing for small mutual deformations but preserving the viewpoint and style constraints",Mechanism,wos_cs_672
"In this paper , we investigate an approach",Mechanism,wos_cs_673
for reconstructing storyline graphs,Purpose,wos_cs_673
"from large-scale collections of Internet images , and optionally other side information such as friendship graphs",Mechanism,wos_cs_673
The storyline graphs can be an effective summary that visualizes various branching narrative structure of events or activities recurring across the input photo sets of a topic class,Background,wos_cs_673
In order to explore further the usefulness of the storyline graphs,Purpose,wos_cs_673
", we leverage them to perform the image sequential prediction tasks , from which photo recommendation applications can benefit",Mechanism,wos_cs_673
"We formulate the storyline reconstruction problem as an inference of sparse time-varying directed graphs , and develop an optimization algorithm that successfully addresses a number of key challenges of Web-scale problems , including global optimality , linear complexity , and easy parallelization",Mechanism,wos_cs_673
With experiments on more than 3,Method,wos_cs_673
"3 millions of images of 24 classes and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk ,",Method,wos_cs_673
"In this paper , we address the problem of jointly summarizing large sets of Flickr images and YouTube videos",Purpose,wos_cs_674
"Starting from the intuition that the characteristics of the two media types are different yet complementary , we develop a fast and easily-parallelizable approach for creating not only high-quality video summaries but also novel structural summaries of online images as storyline graphs",Mechanism,wos_cs_674
The storyline graphs can illustrate various events or activities associated with the topic in a form of a branching network,Mechanism,wos_cs_674
The video summarization is achieved by diversity ranking on the similarity graphs between images and video frames,Mechanism,wos_cs_674
The reconstruction of storyline graphs is formulated as the inference of sparse time-varying directed graphs from a set of photo streams with assistance of videos,Mechanism,wos_cs_674
"For evaluation , we collect the datasets of 20 outdoor activities , consisting of 2",Method,wos_cs_674
7M Flickr images and 16K YouTube videos,Method,wos_cs_674
"Due to the large-scale nature of our problem , we evaluate our algorithm via crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk",Method,wos_cs_674

Web services offer a more reliable and efficient way to access online data than scraping web pages,Background,wos_cs_678
"However , web service data are often in complex hierarchical structures that make it difficult for people to extract the desired parts or to perform any further data manipulation without writing a significant amount of surprisingly intricate code",Purpose,wos_cs_678
"In this paper , we present Gneiss , a tool that extends the familiar spreadsheet metaphor",Mechanism,wos_cs_678
to support working with data returned from web services,Purpose,wos_cs_678
"Gneiss allows users to extract the desired fields in web service data using drag-and-drop , and refine the results through spreadsheet formulas , along with sorting and filtering the data",Mechanism,wos_cs_678
Hierarchical data are stored as nested tables in the spreadsheet and can be flattened for future operations,Mechanism,wos_cs_678
"Data flow is two-way between the spreadsheet and the web services , enabling people to easily make a new request by modifying spreadsheet cells",Mechanism,wos_cs_678
"In addition , using the dependency between spreadsheet cells , our tool is able to create parallel-running data extractions based on the user 's sequential demonstration",Mechanism,wos_cs_678
We use a set of examples,Method,wos_cs_678
Research shows that commonly accepted security requirements are not generally applied in practice,Background,wos_cs_680
"Instead of relying on requirements checklists , security experts rely on their expertise and background knowledge to identify security vulnerabilities",Background,wos_cs_680
"To understand the gap between available checklists and practice ,",Purpose,wos_cs_680
we conducted a series of interviews to encode the decision-making process of security experts and novices during security requirements analysis,Method,wos_cs_680
"Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts : source code , and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities",Method,wos_cs_680
We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis,Method,wos_cs_680
"We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive , comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications , in addition , to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications",Findings,wos_cs_680
Our goal is to build a model that researchers can use,Mechanism,wos_cs_680
"The use of shared mutable state , commonly seen in object-oriented systems , is often problematic due to the potential conflicting interactions between aliases to the same state",Background,wos_cs_683
"We present a substructural type system outfitted with a novel lightweight interference control mechanism , rely-guarantee protocols ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_683
that enables controlled aliasing of shared resources,Purpose,wos_cs_683
Formal verification and validation play a crucial role in making cyberphysical systems ( CPS ) safe,Background,wos_cs_686
"Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained , including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics",Background,wos_cs_686
"In CPS , models are essential ; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world",Purpose,wos_cs_686
"If the real system fits to the model , its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified w",Purpose,wos_cs_686
t,Purpose,wos_cs_686
the model,Purpose,wos_cs_686
"Otherwise , all bets are off",Purpose,wos_cs_686
"This paper introduces ModelPlex , a method",Mechanism,wos_cs_686
ensuring that verification results about models apply to CPS implementations,Purpose,wos_cs_686
ModelPlex provides correctness guarantees for CPS executions at runtime : it combines offline verification of CPS models with runtime validation of system executions for compliance with the model,Mechanism,wos_cs_686
"ModelPlex ensures that the verification results obtained for the model apply to the actual system runs by monitoring the behavior of the world for compliance with the model , assuming the system dynamics deviation is bounded",Mechanism,wos_cs_686
"If , at some point , the observed behavior no longer complies with the model so that offline verification results no longer apply , ModelPlex initiates provably safe fallback actions",Mechanism,wos_cs_686
"This paper , furthermore , develops a systematic technique",Mechanism,wos_cs_686
"We present Marvin , a system",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
that can search physical objects using a mobile or wearable device,Purpose,wos_cs_688
"It integrates HOG-based object recognition , SURF-based localization information , automatic speech recognition , and user feedback information with a probabilistic model",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
to recognize the `` object of interest { '' } at high accuracy and at interactive speeds,Purpose,wos_cs_688
"Once the object of interest is recognized , the information that the user is querying , e",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
g,Mechanism,wos_cs_688
"reviews , options , etc",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
", is displayed on the user 's mobile or wearable device",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
"We tested this prototype in a real-world retail store during business hours , with varied degree of background noise and clutter",Method,wos_cs_688
"We show that this multi-modal approach achieves superior recognition accuracy compared to using a vision system alone , especially in cluttered scenes where a vision system would be unable to distinguish which object is of interest to the user without additional input",Findings,wos_cs_688
"It is computationally able to scale to large numbers of objects by focusing compute-intensive resources on the objects most likely to be of interest , inferred from user speech and implicit localization information",Mechanism,wos_cs_688
We consider the problem of discovering discriminative exemplars suitable for object detection,Purpose,wos_cs_689
"Due to the diversity in appearance in real world objects , an object detector must capture variations in scale , viewpoint , illumination etc",Background,wos_cs_689
"The current approaches do this by using mixtures of models , where each mixture is designed to capture one ( or a few ) axis of variation",Background,wos_cs_689
"Current methods usually rely on heuristics to capture these variations ; however , it is unclear which axes of variation exist and are relevant to a particular task",Background,wos_cs_689
Another issue is the requirement of a large set of training images to capture such variations,Background,wos_cs_689
Current methods do not scale to large training sets either because of training time complexity I I or test time complexity I I,Background,wos_cs_689
"In this work , we explore the idea of compactly capturing task-appropriate variation from the data itself",Purpose,wos_cs_689
"We propose a two stage data-driven process , which selects and learns a compact set of exemplar models",Mechanism,wos_cs_689
for object detection,Purpose,wos_cs_689
"When people observe and interact with physical spaces , they are able to associate functionality to regions in the environment",Background,wos_cs_69
Our goal is to automate dense functional understanding of large spaces,Purpose,wos_cs_69
by leveraging sparse activity demonstrations recorded from an ego-centric viewpoint,Mechanism,wos_cs_69
The method we describe,Mechanism,wos_cs_69
"enables functionality estimation in large scenes where people have behaved , as well as novel scenes where no behaviors are observed",Purpose,wos_cs_69
"Our method learns and predicts `` Action Maps { '' } , which encode the ability for a user to perform activities at various locations",Mechanism,wos_cs_69
"With the usage of an egocentric camera to observe human activities , our method scales with the size of the scene without the need for mounting multiple static surveillance cameras and is well-suited to the task of observing activities up-close",Mechanism,wos_cs_69
"We demonstrate that by capturing appearance-based attributes of the environment and associating these attributes with activity demonstrations , our proposed mathematical framework allows for the prediction of Action Maps in new environments",Findings,wos_cs_69
"Additionally , we offer a preliminary glance of the applicability of Action Maps",Background,wos_cs_69
Growing traffic volumes and the increasing complexity of attacks pose a constant scaling challenge for network intrusion prevention systems ( NIPS ),Background,wos_cs_693
"In this respect , offloading NIPS processing to compute clusters offers an immediately deployable alternative to expensive hardware upgrades",Background,wos_cs_693
"In practice , however , NIPS offloading is challenging on three fronts in contrast to passive network security functions : ( 1 ) NIPS offloading can impact other traffic engineering objectives ; ( 2 ) NIPS offloading impacts user perceived latency ; and ( 3 ) NIPS actively change traffic volumes by dropping unwanted traffic",Purpose,wos_cs_693
"To address these challenges ,",Purpose,wos_cs_693
we present the SNIPS system,Mechanism,wos_cs_693
"We design a formal optimization framework that captures tradeoffs across scalability , network load , and latency",Mechanism,wos_cs_693
We provide a practical implementation using recent advances in software-defined networking without requiring modifications to NIPS hardware,Method,wos_cs_693

This paper studies the problem of matching images captured from an unmanned ground vehicle ( UGV ) to those from a satellite or high-flying vehicle,Purpose,wos_cs_698
We focus on situations where the UGV navigates in remote areas with few man-made structures,Purpose,wos_cs_698
This is a difficult problem due to the drastic change in perspective between the ground and aerial imagery and the lack of environmental features for image comparison,Background,wos_cs_698
"We do not rely on GPS , which may be jammed or uncertain",Background,wos_cs_698
"We propose a two-step approach : ( 1 ) the UGV images are warped to obtain a bird 's eye view of the ground , and ( 2 ) this view is compared to a grid of satellite locations using whole-image descriptors",Mechanism,wos_cs_698
We analyze the performance of a variety of descriptors for different satellite map sizes and various terrain and environment types,Method,wos_cs_698
We incorporate the air-ground matching into a particle-filter framework for localization using the best-performing descriptor,Mechanism,wos_cs_698
"State lattice-based planning has been used in navigation for ground , water , aerial and space robots",Background,wos_cs_699
State lattices are typically constructed of simple motion primitives connecting one state to another,Background,wos_cs_699
"There are situations where these metric motions may not be available , such as in GPS-denied areas",Purpose,wos_cs_699
"In many of these cases , however , the robot may have some additional sensing capability that is not being fully utilized by the planner",Purpose,wos_cs_699
"For example , if the robot has a camera it may be able to use simple visual servoing techniques to navigate through a GPS-denied region",Background,wos_cs_699
"Likewise , a LIDAR may allow the robot to skirt along an environmental feature even if there is not enough information to generate an accurate pose estimate",Background,wos_cs_699
In this paper we present an expansion of the state lattice framework that allows us to incorporate controller-based motion primitives and external perceptual triggers directly into the planning process,Mechanism,wos_cs_699
We provide a formal description of our method of constructing the search graph in these cases,Mechanism,wos_cs_699
as well as presenting real-world and simulated testing data,Method,wos_cs_699
"This paper introduces typy ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_7

embedded by reflection into Python,Mechanism,wos_cs_7
"typy features a fragmentary semantics , i",Mechanism,wos_cs_7
e,Mechanism,wos_cs_7
"it delegates semantic control over each term , drawn from Python 's fixed concrete and abstract syntax , to some contextually relevant user-defined semantic fragment",Mechanism,wos_cs_7
The delegated fragment programmatically 1 ),Mechanism,wos_cs_7
typechecks the term,Purpose,wos_cs_7
( following a bidirectional protocol ) ; and 2 ),Mechanism,wos_cs_7
assigns dynamic meaning to the term,Purpose,wos_cs_7
"The field of object detection has made significant advances riding on the wave of region-based ConvNets ,",Background,wos_cs_70
but their training procedure still includes many heuristics and hyperparameters that are costly to tune,Purpose,wos_cs_70
We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining ( OHEM ) algorithm,Mechanism,wos_cs_70
for training region-based ConvNet detectors,Purpose,wos_cs_70
Our motivation is the same as it has always been detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples,Mechanism,wos_cs_70
Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient,Mechanism,wos_cs_70

Our algorithms are robust to measurement error and are useful in applications where a group of robots need to establish a common coordinate frame based on relative sensing information,Mechanism,wos_cs_700
The problem of establishing a common coordinate frame is formulated in a least squares error framework minimizing the total inconsistency of the measurements,Mechanism,wos_cs_700

The novel handheld manipulator enables the automated scanning of a laser probe within a cylinder of 4 mm long and 4 mm in diameter,Mechanism,wos_cs_702
"For the automation , the surface of the retina is reconstructed using a stereomicroscope , and then preplanned targets are placed on the surface",Mechanism,wos_cs_702

Transfemoral amputees often suffer from falls and a fear of falling that leads to a decreased quality of life,Background,wos_cs_703
"Existing control strategies for powered knee-ankle prostheses demonstrate only limited ability to react to disturbances that induce falls such as trips , slips , and obstacles",Background,wos_cs_703
"In contrast , prior work on neuromuscular modeling of human locomotion suggests that control strategies based on local reflexes exhibit robustness to unobserved terrain such as slopes and steps",Background,wos_cs_703
"Therefore , we propose that a powered knee-ankle prosthesis governed by reflexive local controls will more competently adapt to unperceived disturbances",Purpose,wos_cs_703
"To test this hypothesis ,",Purpose,wos_cs_703
we simulate a neuromuscular model of a transfemoral amputee walking over rough ground with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis governed by the proposed reflexive controller,Mechanism,wos_cs_703
We show that the proposed control allows the amputee to walk farther over rough ground than does the state-of-the-art control,Findings,wos_cs_703
The proposed controller also more readily rejects deviations from nominal walking gaits such as those encountered during a trip,Findings,wos_cs_703
"Control design of running robots is often based on mapping the behavior of lower order models onto the robotic systems , and the robustness of running is largely determined by the robustness of these underlying models",Background,wos_cs_704

"In this work , we develop a single-shot approach",Mechanism,wos_cs_707
to produce dense reconstructions of highly textured objects,Purpose,wos_cs_707
The key to our approach is an image decomposition scheme that can recover the illumination and the texture images from their mixed appearance,Mechanism,wos_cs_707
"Despite the complex appearances of the illuminated textured regions , our method can accurately compute per pixel warps from the illumination pattern and the texture template to the observed image",Mechanism,wos_cs_707
The texture template is obtained by interleaving the projection sequence with an all-white pattern,Mechanism,wos_cs_707
Our estimated warping functions are reliable even with infrequent interleaved projection,Mechanism,wos_cs_707
"Thus , we obtain detailed shape reconstruction and dense motion tracking of the textured surfaces",Mechanism,wos_cs_707
We validate the approach,Findings,wos_cs_707
"In product design , designers often generate a large number of concepts in the form of sketches and drawings to develop and communicate their ideas",Background,wos_cs_709
Concrete concepts typically evolve through a progressive refinement of initially coarse and ambiguous ideas,Background,wos_cs_709
"However , a lack of suitable means to visualize the emerging form at these early stages forces the designer to constantly maintain and negotiate an elusive mental image",Purpose,wos_cs_709
"To assist this process ,",Purpose,wos_cs_709
we describe a predictive modeling technique,Mechanism,wos_cs_709
"that allows early , incomplete 2D sketches to be transformed into suggestive complete models",Purpose,wos_cs_709

These images represented in a high dimensional feature space are projected into a lower dimensional space using component analysis,Mechanism,wos_cs_711
"Using the resulting components , a mapping between the loading configurations and the optimal topologies is learned",Mechanism,wos_cs_711

We focus on devices equipped with odometry sensors that capture changes in motion,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
Odometry suffers from cumulative errors of dead reckoning but it captures the relative shape of the traversed path well,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
Our approach will correct such errors by matching the shape of the trajectory from odometry to traversable paths of a known map,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
Our algorithm is inspired by prior vehicular GPS map matching techniques that snap global GPS measurements to known roads,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
We similarly wish to snap the trajectory from odometry to known hallways,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
Several modifications are required to ensure these techniques are robust when given relative measurements from odometry,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
"If we assume an office-like environment with only straight hallways , then a significant rotation indicates a transition to another hallway",Mechanism,wos_cs_712
"As a result , we partition the trajectory into line segments based on significant turns",Mechanism,wos_cs_712
Each trajectory segment is snapped to a corresponding hallway that best maintains the shape of the original trajectory,Mechanism,wos_cs_712
These snapping decisions are made based on the similarity of the two curves as well as the rotation to transition between hallways,Mechanism,wos_cs_712

Our method extends the working volume by using structured light patterns at multiple projector focus settings,Mechanism,wos_cs_719
A careful characterization of projector blur allows us to decode even partially out-of-focus patterns,Mechanism,wos_cs_719

"Alternatively , it is possible to improve the error to exp ( - ( Omega ) over tilde ( n ) ) at the cost of making the construction Monte Carlo with success probability 1 - exp ( nan ( n ) ) ( while still allowing a compact description of the code )",Findings,wos_cs_790

We initiate the study of seedless non-malleable extractors as a natural variation of the notion of non-malleable extractors introduced by Dodis and Wichs ( STOC 2009 ),Method,wos_cs_790
We show that construction of non-malleable codes for the split-state model reduces to construction of non-malleable two-source extractors,Findings,wos_cs_790
"We prove a general result on existence of seedless non-malleable extractors , which implies that codes obtained from our reduction can achieve rates arbitrarily close to 2014-01-04 00:00:00 and exponentially small error",Findings,wos_cs_790
Recent advances in rendering and data-driven animation have enabled the creation of compelling characters with impressive levels of realism,Background,wos_cs_791
"While data-driven techniques can produce animations that are extremely faithful to the original motion , many challenging problems remain because of the high complexity of human motion",Purpose,wos_cs_791
A better understanding of the factors that make human motion recognizable and appealing would be of great value in industries where creating a variety of appealing virtual characters with realistic motion is required,Background,wos_cs_791
"To investigate these issues ,",Purpose,wos_cs_791
"we captured thirty actors walking , jogging and dancing , and applied their motions to the same virtual character ( one each for the males and females )",Method,wos_cs_791
We then conducted a series of perceptual experiments,Method,wos_cs_791
"to explore the distinctiveness and attractiveness of these human motions , and whether characteristic motion features transfer across an individual 's different gaits",Purpose,wos_cs_791
Average faces are perceived to be less distinctive but more attractive,Background,wos_cs_791
", so we explored whether this was also 1 for body motion",Purpose,wos_cs_791
Transport protocols must accommodate diverse application and network requirements,Background,wos_cs_792
"As a result , TCP has evolved over time with new congestion control algorithms such as support for generalized AIMD , background flows , and multipath",Background,wos_cs_792
"On the other hand , explicit congestion control algorithms have been shown to be more efficient",Background,wos_cs_792
"However , they are inherently more rigid because they rely on in-network components",Background,wos_cs_792
"Therefore , it is not clear whether they can be made flexible enough to support diverse application requirements",Purpose,wos_cs_792
This paper presents a flexible framework,Mechanism,wos_cs_792
"for network resource allocation ,",Purpose,wos_cs_792
"called FCP ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_792
that accommodates diversity,Purpose,wos_cs_792
by exposing a simple abstraction for resource allocation,Mechanism,wos_cs_792
FCP incorporates novel primitives for end-point flexibility ( aggregation and preloading ) into a single framework and makes economics-based congestion control practical by explicitly handling load variations and by decoupling it from actual billing,Mechanism,wos_cs_792
"Phase-contrast microscopy is one of the most common and convenient imaging modalities to observe long-term multi-cellular processes , which generates images by the interference of lights passing through transparent specimens and background medium with different retarded phases",Background,wos_cs_793
"Despite many years of study , computer-aided phase contrast microscopy analysis on cell behavior is challenged by image qualities and artifacts caused by phase contrast optics",Purpose,wos_cs_793
"Addressing the unsolved challenges ,",Purpose,wos_cs_793
"the authors propose ( 1 ) a phase contrast microscopy image restoration method that produces phase retardation features , which are intrinsic features of phase contrast microscopy , and ( 2 ) a semi-supervised learning based algorithm for cell segmentation , which is a fundamental task for various cell behavior analysis",Mechanism,wos_cs_793
"Specifically , the image formation process of phase contrast microscopy images is first computationally modeled with a dictionary of diffraction patterns ; as a result , each pixel of a phase contrast microscopy image is represented by a linear combination of the bases , which we call phase retardation features",Mechanism,wos_cs_793
Images are then partitioned into phase-homogeneous atoms by clustering neighboring pixels with similar phase retardation features,Mechanism,wos_cs_793
"Consequently , cell segmentation is performed via a semi-supervised classification technique over the phase-homogeneous atoms",Mechanism,wos_cs_793
Experiments,Method,wos_cs_793
"Motivation : Several types of studies , including genome-wide association studies and RNA interference screens , strive to link genes to diseases",Background,wos_cs_797
"Although these approaches have had some success , genetic variants are often only present in a small subset of the population , and screens are noisy with low overlap between experiments in different labs",Background,wos_cs_797
Neither provides a mechanistic model explaining how identified genes impact the disease of interest or the dynamics of the pathways those genes regulate,Background,wos_cs_797
Such mechanistic models could be used to accurately predict downstream effects of knocking down pathway members and allow comprehensive exploration of the effects of targeting pairs or higher-order combinations of genes,Background,wos_cs_797
Results :,Findings,wos_cs_797
We developed methods,Mechanism,wos_cs_797
to model the activation of signaling and dynamic regulatory networks involved in disease progression,Purpose,wos_cs_797
"Our model , SDREM , integrates static and time series data to link proteins and the pathways they regulate in these networks",Mechanism,wos_cs_797
SDREM uses prior information about proteins ' likelihood of involvement in a disease ( e,Mechanism,wos_cs_797

from screens ) to improve the quality of the predicted signaling pathways,Mechanism,wos_cs_797
We used our algorithms to study the human immune response to H1N1 influenza infection,Method,wos_cs_797
The resulting networks correctly identified many of the known pathways and transcriptional regulators of this disease,Findings,wos_cs_797
"Furthermore , they accurately predict RNA interference effects and can be used to infer genetic interactions , greatly improving over other methods suggested for this task",Findings,wos_cs_797

Supporting students ' self-regulated learning ( SRL ) is an important topic in the learning sciences,Background,wos_cs_799
Two critical processes involved in SRL are self-assessment and study choice,Background,wos_cs_799
"Intelligent tutoring systems ( ITSs ) have been shown to be effective in supporting students ' domain-level learning through guided problem-solving practice , but it is an open question how they can support SRL processes effectively , while maintaining or even enhancing their effectiveness at the domain level",Background,wos_cs_799
We used a combination of user-centered design techniques,Mechanism,wos_cs_799
and experimental classroom research,Method,wos_cs_799
to redesign and evaluate an ITS for linear equation solving so it supports self-assessment and study choice,Purpose,wos_cs_799
"We added three features to the tutor ' Open Learner Model ( OLM ) that may scaffold students ' self-assessment ( self-assessment prompts , delaying the update of students ' progress bars , and providing progress information on the problem type level )",Mechanism,wos_cs_799
We also designed a problem selection screen with shared student/system control and game-like features,Mechanism,wos_cs_799
We went through two iterations of design and conducted two controlled experiments with 160 local middle school students to evaluate the effectiveness of the new features,Method,wos_cs_799
"The evaluations reveal that the new OLM with self-assessment support facilitates students ' learning processes , and enhances their learning outcomes significantly",Findings,wos_cs_799
"However , we did not find significant learning gains due to the problem selection feature",Findings,wos_cs_799
"When human annotators are given a choice about what to label in an image , they apply their own subjective judgments on what to ignore and what to mention",Background,wos_cs_80
We refer to these noisy `` human-centric { '' } annotations as exhibiting human reporting bias,Purpose,wos_cs_80
"Examples of such annotations include image tags and keywords found on photo sharing sites , or in datasets containing image captions",Purpose,wos_cs_80
"In this paper , we use these noisy annotations for learning visually correct image classifiers",Purpose,wos_cs_80
"Such annotations do not use consistent vocabulary , and miss a significant amount of the information present in an image ; however , we demonstrate that the noise in these annotations exhibits structure and can be modeled",Mechanism,wos_cs_80
We propose an algorithm to decouple the human reporting bias from the correct visually grounded labels,Mechanism,wos_cs_80
Our results are highly interpretable for reporting `` what 's in the image { '' } versus `` what 's worth saying,Findings,wos_cs_80
"{ '' } We demonstrate the algorithm 's efficacy along a variety of metrics and datasets , including MS COCO and Yahoo Flickr 100M",Method,wos_cs_80
We introduce confidence-weighted ( CW ) online learning algorithms,Mechanism,wos_cs_800
"for robust , cost-sensitive classification",Purpose,wos_cs_800
Our work extends the original confidence-weighted optimization framework in two important directions,Mechanism,wos_cs_800
"First , we show how the original value at risk ( VaR ) probabilistic constraint in CW algorithms can be generalized to a worst-case conditional value at risk ( CVaR ) constraint for more robust learning from cost-weighted examples",Mechanism,wos_cs_800
"Second , we show how to reduce adversarial feature noise , which can be useful in fraud detection scenarios , by reframing the optimization problem in terms of maximum a posteriori estimation",Mechanism,wos_cs_800
The resulting optimization problems can be solved efficiently,Mechanism,wos_cs_800
Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets,Method,wos_cs_800
"show that our robust , cost-sensitive extensions consistently reduce the cost incurred in both online and batch learning settings",Findings,wos_cs_800
"We also demonstrate a correspondence between the VaR and CVaR constraints used for classification and uncertainty sets used in robust optimization ,",Findings,wos_cs_800

"This paper proposes a vision-based method for detecting apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_806
which is essential for non-perturbative monitoring of cell expansion,Purpose,wos_cs_806
"Our method targets non-adherent cells , which float or are suspended freely in the culture medium-in contrast to adherent cells , which are attached to a petri dish",Mechanism,wos_cs_806
"The method first detects cell regions and tracks them over time , resulting in the construction of cell tracklets",Mechanism,wos_cs_806
"For each of the tracklets , visual properties of the cell are then examined to know whether and when the tracklet shows a transition from a live cell to a dead cell , in order to determine the occurrence and timing of a cell death event",Mechanism,wos_cs_806
"For the validation , a transductive learning framework is adopted to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data",Method,wos_cs_806
"Our method achieved promising performance in the experiments with hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) populations ,",Findings,wos_cs_806
"Silhouettes provide rich information on three-dimensional shape , since the intersection of the associated visual cones generates the `` visual hull { '' } , which encloses and approximates the original shape",Background,wos_cs_81
"However , not all silhouettes can actually be projections of the same object in space : this simple observation has implications in object recognition and multi-view segmentation , and has been ( often implicitly ) used as a basis for camera calibration",Background,wos_cs_81
"In this paper , we investigate the conditions for multiple silhouettes , or more generally arbitrary closed image sets , to be geometrically `` consistent { '' }",Purpose,wos_cs_81
"We present this notion as a natural generalization of traditional multi-view geometry , which deals with consistency for points",Method,wos_cs_81
After discussing some general results,Findings,wos_cs_81
", we present a `` dual { '' } formulation for consistency , that gives conditions for a family of planar sets to be sections of the same object",Mechanism,wos_cs_81
"Finally , we introduce a more general notion of silhouette `` compatibility { '' } under partial knowledge of the camera projections",Mechanism,wos_cs_81
"Politeness is believed to facilitate communication in human interaction , as it can minimize the potential for conflict and confrontation",Background,wos_cs_810
"Regarding the role of politeness strategies for human-robot interaction , conflicting findings are presented in the literature",Background,wos_cs_810
"Thus , we conducted a between-participants experimental study with a receptionist robot",Method,wos_cs_810
"to gain a deeper understanding of how politeness on the one hand , and the type of interaction itself on the other hand , might affect and shape user experience and evaluation of HRI",Purpose,wos_cs_810
"Large-scale information processing systems are able to extract massive collections of interrelated facts ,",Background,wos_cs_811
but unfortunately transforming these candidate facts into useful knowledge is a formidable challenge,Purpose,wos_cs_811
"In this paper , we show how uncertain extractions about entities and their relations",Purpose,wos_cs_811
can be transformed into a knowledge graph,Mechanism,wos_cs_811
"The extractions form an extraction graph and we refer to the task of removing noise , inferring missing information , and determining which candidate facts should be included into a knowledge graph as knowledge graph identification",Mechanism,wos_cs_811
"In order to perform this task , we must reason jointly about candidate facts and their associated extraction confidences , identify co-referent entities , and incorporate ontological constraints",Mechanism,wos_cs_811
"Our proposed approach uses probabilistic soft logic ( PSL ) , a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework which easily scales to millions of facts",Mechanism,wos_cs_811
We demonstrate the power of our method on a synthetic Linked Data corpus derived from the MusicBrainz music community and a real-world set of extractions from the NELL project containing over 1M extractions and 70K ontological relations,Method,wos_cs_811
Occlusions are common in real world scenes and are a major obstacle to robust object detection,Background,wos_cs_812
"In this paper , we present a method",Mechanism,wos_cs_812
to coherently reason about occlusions on many types of detectors,Purpose,wos_cs_812
Previous approaches primarily enforced local coherency or learned the occlusion structure from data,Background,wos_cs_812
"However , local coherency ignores the occlusion structure in real world scenes and learning from data requires tediously labeling many examples of occlusions for every view of every object",Background,wos_cs_812
Other approaches require binary classifications of matching scores,Background,wos_cs_812
We address these limitations by formulating occlusion reasoning as an efficient search over occluding blocks which best explain a probabilistic matching pattern,Mechanism,wos_cs_812
"Binary codes that are binarizations of features represented by real numbers have recently been used in the object recognition field , in order to achieve reduced memory and robustness with respect to noise",Background,wos_cs_813
"However , binarizing features represented by real numbers has a problem in that a great deal of the information within the features drops out",Purpose,wos_cs_813
"That is why we focus on quantization residual , which is information that drops out when features are binarized",Purpose,wos_cs_813
"With this study , we introduce a transition likelihood model into classifiers ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_813
in order to take into consideration the possibility that a binary code which has been observed from an image will transition to another binary code,Purpose,wos_cs_813
"This enables classifications that consider transitions to the desired binary code , even if the observed binary code differs from the actually desired binary code for some reason",Mechanism,wos_cs_813

Reference Trajectory Planning ( I ) makes use of dense lattice sampling and optimization techniques,Mechanism,wos_cs_815

Vehicular ad hoc networks ( VANETs ) are seen as an important enabling technology for improving both traffic safety and efficiency,Background,wos_cs_816
Virtual Traffic Lights ( VTLs ) are a promising proposal for reducing travel time by efficiently controlling road intersections,Background,wos_cs_816
VTLs use vehicle-to-vehicle communication to dynamically optimize traffic flow and they display traffic light information on the windshield,Background,wos_cs_816
"However , research so far has assumed that all vehicles are equipped with VTL support and it has ignored the incremental deployment phase , which could last decades",Purpose,wos_cs_816
In this paper we present a solution for a VTL partial deployment scenario that is based on the idea of having VTL equipped cars display traffic light information on the outside of the vehicle,Mechanism,wos_cs_816
"This allows drivers in non-equipped vehicles , or even pedestrians , to see the light color and respond accordingly",Purpose,wos_cs_816
We show that the benefits of VTLs,Findings,wos_cs_816

We propose an identity-aware multi-object tracker based on the solution path algorithm,Mechanism,wos_cs_82
Our tracker not only,Mechanism,wos_cs_82
produces identity-coherent trajectories,Purpose,wos_cs_82
"based on cues such as face recognition ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_82
but also has the ability to pinpoint potential tracking errors,Purpose,wos_cs_82
"The tracker is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem with l ( 0 ) norm constraints , which we propose to solve with the solution path algorithm",Mechanism,wos_cs_82
"The algorithm successively solves the same optimization problem but under different l ( p ) norm constraints , where p gradually decreases from 1 to 0",Mechanism,wos_cs_82
"Inspired by the success of the solution path algorithm in various machine learning tasks , this strategy is expected to converge to a better local minimum than directly minimizing the hardly solvable l ( 0 ) norm or the roughly approximated l ( 1 ) norm constraints",Mechanism,wos_cs_82
"Furthermore , the acquired solution path complies with the `` decision making process { '' } of the tracker , which provides more insight to locating potential tracking errors",Mechanism,wos_cs_82
Experiments,Method,wos_cs_82
"show that not only is our proposed tracker effective , but also the solution path enables automatic pinpointing of potential tracking failures ,",Findings,wos_cs_82
Spoken dialogue systems typically use predefined semantic slots to parse users ' natural language inputs into unified semantic representations,Background,wos_cs_820
"To define the slots , domain experts and professional annotators are often involved , and the cost can be expensive",Purpose,wos_cs_820
"In this paper , we ask the following question : given a collection of unlabeled raw audios , can we use the frame semantics theory to automatically induce and fill the semantic slots in an unsupervised fashion ?",Purpose,wos_cs_820
"To do this , we propose the use of a state-of-the-art frame-semantic parser , and a spectral clustering based slot ranking model that adapts the generic output of the parser to the target semantic space",Mechanism,wos_cs_820

"Researchers in multi-robot systems have shown benefits of haptic feedback in obstacle navigation before ,",Background,wos_cs_829
but this study is a novel method because of the decentralized formation of the robotic swarm,Mechanism,wos_cs_829
Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects so that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters,Background,wos_cs_83
"The crucial step in most clustering algorithms is to find an appropriate similarity metric , which is both challenging and problem-dependent",Background,wos_cs_83
"Supervised clustering approaches , which can exploit labeled clustered training data that share a common metric with the test set , have thus been proposed",Background,wos_cs_83
"Unfortunately , current metric learning approaches for supervised clustering do not scale to large or even medium-sized datasets",Purpose,wos_cs_83
"In this paper , we propose a new structured Mahalanobis Distance Metric Learning method",Mechanism,wos_cs_83
for supervised clustering,Purpose,wos_cs_83

Previous studies have examined the characteristics of physiological tremor under laboratory settings as well as different operating conditions,Background,wos_cs_830
"However , different test methods make the comparison of results across trials and conditions difficult",Background,wos_cs_830

We consider the problem of semi-supervised bootstrap learning for scene categorization,Purpose,wos_cs_834
Existing semi-supervised approaches are typically unreliable and face semantic drift because the learning task is under-constrained,Background,wos_cs_834
"This is primarily because they ignore the strong interactions that often exist between scene categories , such as the common attributes shared across categories as well as the attributes which make one scene different from another",Background,wos_cs_834
The goal of this paper is to exploit these relationships and constrain the semi-supervised learning problem,Purpose,wos_cs_834
"For example , the knowledge that an image is an auditorium can improve labeling of amphitheaters by enforcing constraint that an amphitheater image should have more circular structures than an auditorium image",Background,wos_cs_834
"We propose constraints based on mutual exclusion , binary attributes and comparative attributes and show that they help us",Mechanism,wos_cs_834

our approach models the effect of the physical environment on the choice of human actions,Mechanism,wos_cs_835
This is accomplished by the use of state-of-the-art semantic scene understanding combined with ideas from optimal control theory,Mechanism,wos_cs_835

Reconstructing an arbitrary configuration of 3D points from their projection in an image is an ill-posed problem,Background,wos_cs_837
"When the points hold semantic meaning , such as anatomical landmarks on a body , human observers can often infer a plausible 3D configuration , drawing on extensive visual memory",Background,wos_cs_837
We present an activity-independent method,Mechanism,wos_cs_837

leveraging a large motion capture corpus as a proxy for visual memory,Mechanism,wos_cs_837
Our method solves for anthropometrically regular body pose and explicitly estimates the camera via a matching pursuit algorithm operating on the image projections,Mechanism,wos_cs_837
Anthropometric regularity ( i,Mechanism,wos_cs_837
", that limbs obey known proportions ) is a highly informative prior , but directly applying such constraints is intractable",Mechanism,wos_cs_837
"Instead , we enforce a necessary condition on the sum of squared limb-lengths that can be solved for in closed form to discourage implausible configurations in 3D",Mechanism,wos_cs_837
We evaluate performance on a wide variety of human poses captured from different viewpoints and,Method,wos_cs_837
Human pose estimation requires a versatile yet well-constrained spatial model for grouping locally ambiguous parts together to produce a globally consistent hypothesis,Background,wos_cs_838
"Previous works either use local deformable models deviating from a certain template , or use a global mixture representation in the pose space",Purpose,wos_cs_838
"In this paper , we propose a new hierarchical spatial model that can capture an exponential number of poses with a compact mixture representation on each part",Mechanism,wos_cs_838
"Using latent nodes , it can represent high-order spatial relationship among parts with exact inference",Mechanism,wos_cs_838
"Different from recent hierarchical models that associate each latent node to a mixture of appearance templates ( like HoG ) , we use the hierarchical structure as a pure spatial prior avoiding the large and often confounding appearance space",Mechanism,wos_cs_838
We verify the effectiveness of this model in three ways,Method,wos_cs_838

Multi-task learning in Convolutional Networks has displayed remarkable success in the field of recognition,Background,wos_cs_84
This success can be largely attributed to learning shared representations from multiple supervisory tasks,Background,wos_cs_84
"However , existing multi-task approaches rely on enumerating multiple network architectures specific to the tasks at hand , that do not generalize",Purpose,wos_cs_84
"In this paper , we propose a principled approach",Mechanism,wos_cs_84
to learn shared representations in ConvNets,Purpose,wos_cs_84
using multi-task learning,Mechanism,wos_cs_84
"Specifically , we propose a new sharing unit : `` cross-stitch { '' } unit",Mechanism,wos_cs_84
These units combine the activations from multiple networks and can be trained end-to-end,Mechanism,wos_cs_84
A network with cross-stitch units can learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations,Mechanism,wos_cs_84
We address the problem of understanding scenes from multiple sources of sensor data ( e,Purpose,wos_cs_840
", a camera and a laser scanner ) in the case where there is no one-to-one correspondence across modalities ( e",Purpose,wos_cs_840
g,Purpose,wos_cs_840
", pixels and 3-D points )",Purpose,wos_cs_840
"This is an important scenario that frequently arises in practice not only when two different types of sensors are used , but also when the sensors are not co-located and have different sampling rates",Background,wos_cs_840
"Previous work has addressed this problem by restricting interpretation to a single representation in one of the domains , with augmented features that attempt to encode the information from the other modalities",Background,wos_cs_840
"Instead , we propose to analyze all modalities simultaneously while propagating information across domains during the inference procedure",Mechanism,wos_cs_840
"In addition to the immediate benefit of generating a complete interpretation in all of the modalities ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_840
Object discovery algorithms group together image regions that originate from the same object,Background,wos_cs_841
"This process is effective when the input collection of images contains a large number of densely sampled views of each object , thereby creating strong connections between nearby views",Background,wos_cs_841
"However , existing approaches are less effective when the input data only provide sparse coverage of object views",Purpose,wos_cs_841
We propose an approach for object discovery,Mechanism,wos_cs_841
that addresses this problem,Purpose,wos_cs_841
We collect a database of about 5 million product images that capture 1,Mechanism,wos_cs_841
2 million objects from multiple views,Mechanism,wos_cs_841
We represent each region in the input image by a `` bag { '' } of database object regions,Mechanism,wos_cs_841
We group input regions together if they share similar `` bags of regions,Mechanism,wos_cs_841
"The problem of training classifiers from limited data is one that particularly affects large-scale and social applications , and as a result , although carefully trained machine learning forms the backbone of many current techniques in research , it sees dramatically fewer applications for end-users",Background,wos_cs_842
Recently we demonstrated a technique for selecting or recommending a single good classifier from a large library even with highly impoverished training data,Background,wos_cs_842

We study type-directed encodings of the simply-typed lambda-calculus in a session-typed pi-calculus,Purpose,wos_cs_843
"The translations proceed in two steps : standard embeddings of simply-typed lambda-calculus in a linear lambda-calculus , followed by a standard translation of linear natural deduction to linear sequent calculus",Method,wos_cs_843
We have shown in prior work how to give a Curry-Howard interpretation of the proofs in the linear sequent calculus as pi-calculus processes subject to a session type discipline,Background,wos_cs_843
"The detection of apoptosis , or programmed cell death , is important to understand the underlying mechanism of cell development",Background,wos_cs_844
"At present , apoptosis detection resorts to fluorescence or colorimetric assays , which may affect cell behavior and thus not allow long-term monitoring of intact cells",Purpose,wos_cs_844

The method first detects candidates for apoptotic cells based on the optical principle of phase-contrast microscopy in connection with the properties of apoptotic cells,Mechanism,wos_cs_844
The temporal behavior of each candidate is then examined in its neighboring frames in order,Mechanism,wos_cs_844
to determine if the candidate is indeed an apoptotic cell,Purpose,wos_cs_844
"When applied to three C2C12 myoblastic stem cell populations , which contain more than 1000 apoptosis",Method,wos_cs_844
Cache compression is a promising technique to increase on-chip cache capacity and to decrease on-chip and off-chip bandwidth usage,Background,wos_cs_847
"Unfortunately , directly applying well-known compression algorithms ( usually implemented in software ) leads to high hardware complexity and unacceptable decompression/compression latencies , which in turn can negatively affect performance",Background,wos_cs_847
"Hence , there is a need for a simple yet efficient compression technique that can effectively compress common in-cache data patterns , and has minimal effect on cache access latency",Purpose,wos_cs_847
"In this paper , we introduce a new compression algorithm called Base-Delta-Immediate ( B Delta I ) compression ,",Mechanism,wos_cs_847
a practical technique for compressing data in on-chip caches,Purpose,wos_cs_847
"The key idea is that , for many cache lines , the values within the cache line have a low dynamic range - i",Mechanism,wos_cs_847
e,Mechanism,wos_cs_847
", the differences between values stored within the cache line are small",Mechanism,wos_cs_847
"As a result , a cache line can be represented using a base value and an array of differences whose combined size is much smaller than the original cache line ( we call this the base+ delta encoding )",Mechanism,wos_cs_847
"Moreover , many cache lines intersperse such base+ delta values with small values - our B Delta I technique efficiently incorporates such immediate values into its encoding",Mechanism,wos_cs_847
Compared to prior cache compression approaches,Method,wos_cs_847
Most contemporary object detection approaches assume each object instance in the training data to be uniquely represented by a single bounding box,Background,wos_cs_848
"In this paper , we go beyond this conventional view by allowing an object instance to be described by multiple bounding boxes",Purpose,wos_cs_848
The new bounding box annotations are determined based on the alignment of an object instance with the other training instances in the dataset,Mechanism,wos_cs_848
Our proposal enables the training data to be reused multiple times for training richer multi-component category models,Mechanism,wos_cs_848
"We operationalize this idea by two complementary operations : bounding box shrinking , which finds subregions of an object instance that could be shared ; and bounding box enlarging , which enlarges object instances to include local contextual cues",Mechanism,wos_cs_848
"In practical applications of robot swarms with bio-inspired behaviors , a human operator will need to exert control over the swarm to fulfill the mission objectives",Background,wos_cs_850
"In many operational settings , human operators are remotely located and the communication environment is harsh",Background,wos_cs_850

In this paper we introduce a method,Mechanism,wos_cs_87
for constructing compact generative representations of PCD at multiple levels of detail,Purpose,wos_cs_87
"As opposed to deterministic structures such as voxel grids or octrees , we propose probabilistic subdivisions of the data through local mixture modeling , and show how these subdivisions can provide a maximum likelihood segmentation of the data",Mechanism,wos_cs_87

"Unlike traditional deterministic spatial subdivision methods , our technique enables dynamic creation of voxel grids according the application 's best needs",Mechanism,wos_cs_87
"In contrast to other generative models for PCD , we explicitly enforce sparsity among points and mixtures , a technique which we call expectation sparsification",Mechanism,wos_cs_87

"Sudden weight gain in patients living with Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) is often an indication that the individual is retaining fluid , which often means that patient 's heart has weakened leading to increased risk of kidney or cardiac failure",Background,wos_cs_92
