The first, LL (1), makes a decision on which grammar production to use based on the first character of the input string. If that were ambiguous, the grammar would have to be rewritten to fall into this class, which is not always possible. The second, LR (1), can postpone the decision at first by pushing input characters onto a stack and then deciding on the production later, taking into account both the first input character and the stack.

This paper is a tutorial on how to model and prove complex properties of complex hybrid systems in KeYmaera, an automatic and interactive formal verification tool for hybrid systems implementing differential dynamic logic. Hybrid systems can model highly nontrivial controllers of physical plants, whose behaviors are often safety critical such as trains, cars, airplanes, or medical devices. Formal methods can help design systems that work correctly. This paper illustrates how KeYmaera can be used to systematically model, validate, and

Together with identity elimination, this justifies our program of viewing the inference rules as defining the meaning of the connectives even more clearly than the cut reduction and identity expansion by themselves.

The double-cut-and-join (DCJ) model has formed the basis for most algorithmic research on rearrangements over the last few years. The edit distance under the DCJ model can be computed in linear time for genomes without duplicate genes, while the problem becomes NP-hard in the presence of duplicate genes. In this article, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to compute the DCJ distance between two

For example, knowing where bottleneck links are, network operators can apply traffic engineering either at the interdomain or intradomain level to improve routing. Existing tools either fail to identify the location of bottlenecks, or generate a large amount of probing packets. In addition, they often require access to both end points.

Humans can generate diverse locomotion behaviors through the hierarchical control of the supraspinal and the spinal systems, where the spinal control is often assumed to consist of central pattern generators and reflexes. It has been demonstrated through simulation that human walking and running can be generated with control models where the central pattern generator is controlled in a hierarchical structure. However, no reflex control model in such framework has been proposed. Here we propose that locomotion behaviors

In this paper we review a series of experiments in which automation is introduced in controlling robot teams. Automating path planning at a foraging task improved both target detection and localization which is closely tied to SA. Timing data, however, suggested

This problem has a long history and has attracted much attention, debate, claims that it is unsolvable, and purported solutions. Unlike other ecological inference techniques, our method makes use of unlabeled individual-level data by embedding the distribution over these predictors into a vector in Hilbert space. Our approach relies on recent learning theory results for distribution regression, using kernel

However, sensors mounted on the vehicle are regularly viewpoint impaired. A vehicle navigating at high speeds in offroad environments may be unable to react to negative obstacles such as large holes and cliffs. One approach to address this problem is to complement the sensing capabilities of an unmanned ground vehicle with overhead data gathered from an aerial source. This paper presents

We show that, in this more expressive calculus, finite sets of patterns without repeated variables are closed

One may prefer a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions, but often the number of coalition structures is too large to allow exhaustive search for the optimal one. Furthermore, finding the optimal coalition structure is NP-complete. But then, can the coalition structure found via a partial search be guaranteed to be within a bound from optimum? We show that none of the previous coalition structure generation algorithms can establish any bound because

The main aim of this style of presentation is semantic modularity: we can add new language features without having to rewrite prior definitions for smaller language fragments. We determine that this is mostly the case, although structural properties of the specification such as weakening or

Focusing is a way to eliminate much of this redundancy. On the so-called negative fragment of intutionistic logic, which consists of all connectives whose right rules are invertible, we can restore an isomorphism between verifications and focused proofs. If we also include positive connectives, we can do even better than verifications by further narrowing down the space of proofs with focusing. On

It is based on the fact that a large number of existing algorithms can be written as estimators of (conditional) densities by means of an exponential family. Special cases of this include Support Vectors, Gaussian Processes and Undirected graphical models and their combinations. It allows us to derive a large number of novel algorithms and statistical interpretations of existing algorithms easily, such as for multiclass classification, estimation

Given a sequence of words, our model employs deep gated recurrent units on both character and word levels to encode morphology and context information, and applies a conditional random field layer to predict the tags. Our model is task independent, language independent, and feature engineering free. We further extend our model to multi-task and cross-lingual joint training by sharing the architecture and parameters. Our model

Type preservation is stated roughly as follows: if a phrase has type and evaluates to a value v, then v has type. In addition to being a very important property of SML, the proof of this theorem, which will be done with the theorem prover HOL, will demonstrate several things. First, that theorem provers are now capable of tackling big software problems. Second, that the speci cation technique used in the The De nition of Standard ML is a reasonable one

The use of crowds to gather information for PSS is therefore particularly challenging. In this study, we explore the impact of two policies on user contributions. A quid-pro-quo policy exchanges contributions from users for access to critical information in the system. A request policy simply reminds the user that information is needed to make the system function well. Prior research has shown that request for help in crowdsourced

We advocate a view of modularity that emphasizes not the mere assembling of software systems from component parts, but rather the specification of interfaces between components, verification that components meet their specifications, and the assembling only of components with compatible specifications. Key to this methodology is the use of types to specify and automatically to verify adherence to interfaces. We claim that this methodology makes a

Its tracing engine automatically discovers inter-node data dependencies and inter-request compute times for each node (process) in an application. This information is reflected in per-node annotated I/O traces. Such annotation allows a parallel replayer to closely mimic the behavior of a traced application across a variety of storage systems. When compared to other replay mechanisms,//TRACE offers

But existing approaches either make strong assumptions about the structure of the data, or gather new data through online algorithms that are likely to play severely suboptimal strategies. We develop a new approach to learning the parameters of the behavioral model of a bounded rational attacker (thereby pinpointing a near optimal strategy), by observing

Many authors have proposed that transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One hypothesis is that the sharing of parts is core to one shot learning, and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters, using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a rich internal part structure, yet they are particularly

As distributed systems grow in scale and complexity, such tracing is becoming a critical tool for management tasks like diagnosis and resource accounting.

Specifically, we are given m random samples of coalitions and their values, taken from some unknown cooperative game; can we predict the values of unseen coalitions? We study the PAC learnability of several well-known classes of cooperative games, such as network flow games, threshold task games, and induced subgraph games. We also establish a novel connection between PAC learnability and core stability: for

We investigate this question for a space of matrix decomposition models which can express a variety of widely used models from unsupervised learning. To enable model selection, we organize these models into a context-free grammar which generates a wide variety of structures through the compositional application of a few simple rules. We use our grammar to generically and

This paper develops a new technique for gaining insight into such changes: comparing system behaviours from two executions (eg, of two system versions or time periods). Building on end-to-end request flow tracing within and across components, algorithms are described for identifying and ranking changes in the flow and/or timing of request processing. The implementation of these algorithms in a tool called Spectroscope

This makes storing an unknown number elements problematic: if the size is too small we may run out of places to put them, and if it is too large we will waste memory. Linked lists do not this problem at all since they are extensible, but accessing an element is O (1). In this lecture, we introduce unbounded arrays, which like lists can hold an arbitrary number of elements, but also allow these element to be retrieved in O (1) time? What

Based on this analysis, we develop a different method of pre-training DBMs that distributes the modelling work more evenly over the hidden layers. Our results on the MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the new pre-training algorithm allows us

The existence of the inherent hysteretic behavior hinders the tracking accuracy of the actuators. To make matters worse, the hysteretic behavior changes with rate. One of the suggested ways is to have a feedforward controller to linearize the relationship between the input and output. Thus, the hysteretic behavior of the actuator must be first modeled by sensing the relationship

Robots must decide amongst themselves who should work on which goals and at what time each goal should be achieved. Since the team is situated in some physical environment, the robots must consider travel time in these decisions. This is particularly challenging in time critical domains where goal rewards decrease over time and for tightly coupled coordination where multiple robots must work together on each goal. Further complications arise when
