Introduction With an enormous amount of visual data online, web and social media are among the most important sources of data for vision research.

The resulting clean data has helpe"",""unt of data, but are less robust to the noise. Fortunately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [27] have resurfaced as a powerful tool for learning from large-scale data: when trained with ImageNet [44] (˘1M images), it is not only able to achieve state-of-the-art performance for the same image classiﬁcation task, but the learned representation can be readily applied to other relevant tasks [20, 62]"",""ed in vision nowadays are well-studied and search engines give relatively clean results. Therefore, instead of using random noun phrases, we obtained three lists of categories from ImageNet Challenge [44], SUN database [61] and NEIL knowledge base [10].

cultural heritage through generations. However, automatically recognizing cultural events still remains a great challenge since it depends on understanding of complex image contents such as people, objects, and scene context. Therefore, it is intuitive to associate this task with other high-level vision problems, e.g., object detection, recognition, and scene understanding. In this paper, we address this problem by combining both ideas of object / scene contents mining and strong image representation via CNN into a whole framework. Specifically, for object / scene contents mining, we employ selective search to extract a batch of bottom-up region proposals, which are served as key object / scene candidates in each event image, while for representation via CNN, we investigate two state-of-the-art deep architectures, VGGNet and GoogLeNet, and adapt them to our task by performing domain-specific (i.e., event) fine-tuning on both global image and hierarchical region proposals. These two models can complementarily exploit feature hierarchies spatially, which simultaneously capture the global context and local evidences within the image. In our final submission for ChaLearn LAP Challenge ICCV 2015, nine kinds of features extracted from five different deep models were exploited and followed with two kinds of classifiers for decision level fusion. Our method achieves the best performance of mAP=0.854 among all the participants in the track of cultural event recognition.",1605,alexander hauptmann,language technologies institute,59dcb9422bdc9e7b0a6feb6f,wos_cs_477,,,msa_2240344248,-20.755,wos_pm,wos_cs_477,04659,"[{u'AuId': 2111345224, u'AfN': u'zhejiang university', u'DAfN': u'Zhejiang University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'haoquan shen', u'AfId': 76130692, u'DAuN': u'Haoquan Shen'}, {u'AuId': 2098100626, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'shooui yu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Shoou-I Yu'}, {u'AuId': 2430169722, u'AfN': u'university of queensland', u'DAfN': u'University of Queensland', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'yi yang', u'AfId': 165143802, u'DAuN': u'Yi Yang'}, {u'AuId': 2169392701, u'AfN': u'xi an jiaotong university', u'DAfN': u""Xi'an Jiaotong University"", u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'deyu meng', u'AfId': 87445476, u'DAuN': u'Deyu Meng'}, {u'AuId': 2113269357, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'alexander g hauptmann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alexander G.

We use the training samples from a public image pose dataset to avoid the tediousness of labeling video streams. There are two main problems confronted. First, the distribution of images and videos are different. Second, no temporal information is available in the training images. To smooth the inconsistency between the labeled images and unlabeled videos, our algorithm iteratively incorporates the pose knowledge harvested from the testing videos into the image pose detector via an adjust-and-refine method. During this process, continuity and tracking constraints are imposed to leverage the spatio-temporal information only available in videos. For our experiments, we have collected two datasets from YouTube and experiments show that our method achieves good performance for parsing human motions. Furthermore, we found that our method achieves better performance by using unlabeled video than adding more labeled pose images into the training set.",1089,alexander hauptmann,language technologies institute,59dcbdce2bdc9e7b0a709234,wos_cs_726,,,msa_2243279568,-20.67,wos_pm,wos_cs_726,01472,"[{u'AuId': 2169233553, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yunnung chen', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yun-Nung Chen'}, {u'AuId': 17920550, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'alexander i rudnicky', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alexander I.

However, current technology typically limits conversational interactions to a few narrow predefined domains/topics. For example, dialogue systems for smartphone operation fail to respond when users ask for functions not supported by currently installed applications. We propose to dynamically add application-based domains according to users' requests by using descriptions of applications as a retrieval cue to find relevant applications. The approach uses structured knowledge resources (e.g. Freebase, Wikipedia, FrameNet) to induce types of slots for generating semantic seeds, and enriches the semantics of spoken queries with neural word embeddings, where semantically related concepts can be additionally included for acquiring knowledge that does not exist in the predefined domains. The system can then retrieve relevant applications or dynamically suggest users install applications that support unexplored domains.

In this paper we introduce a method for constructing compact generative representations of PCD at multiple levels of detail. As opposed to deterministic structures such as voxel grids or octrees, we propose probabilistic subdivisions of the data through local mixture modeling, and show how these subdivisions can provide a maximum likelihood segmentation of the data. The final representation is hierarchical, compact, parametric, and statistically derived, facilitating run-time occupancy calculations through stochastic sampling. Unlike traditional deterministic spatial subdivision methods, our technique enables dynamic creation of voxel grids according the application's best needs. In contrast to other generative models for PCD, we explicitly enforce sparsity among points and mixtures, a technique which we call expectation sparsification. This leads to a highly parallel hierarchical Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm well-suited for the GPU and real-time execution. We explore the trade-offs between model fidelity and model size at various levels of detail, our tests showing favorable performance when compared to octree and NDT-based methods.",1298,alonzo kelly,robotics institute,59dc7a322bdc9e77bc6c703f,wos_cs_87,,,msa_2429678572,-20.404,wos_pm,wos_cs_87,01036,"[{u'AuId': 2561278943, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'abhijeet tallavajhula', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Abhijeet Tallavajhula'}, {u'AuId': 2141261700, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'alonzo kelly', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alonzo Kelly'}]","{u'CN': u'icra', u'CId': 1163902177}",0,"{u'CIId': 180686917, u'CIN': u'icra 2015'}",2015-05-01,"{""DN"":""Construction and validation of a high fidelity simulator for a planar range sensor"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":130,""InvertedIndex"":{""We"":[0,112],""study"":[1],""the"":[2,10,19,26,46,54,69,108],""problem"":[3],""of"":[4,12,22,29,48,79,91,123],""building"":[5,39],""a"":[6,63,84,96],""sensor"":[7,82,117],""model"":[8],""for"":[9,31,38],""purpose"":[11],""simulation."":[13],""Our"":[14],""work"":[15],""is"":[16,36,56,87,102],""motivated"":[17],""by"":[18],""potential"":[20],""impact"":[21],""realistic"":[23],""simulators"":[24],""on"":[25,125],""development"":[27],""cycle"":[28],""software"":[30],""real"":[32,128],""robots."":[33],""The"":[34,89],""case"":[35],""made"":[37],""models"":[40],""from"":[41,62],""approximate"":[42],""state"":[43],""information,"":[44],""relieving"":[45],""burden"":[47],""ground"":[49],""truth."":[50],""Unlike"":[51],""calibration,"":[52],""where"":[53],""goal"":[55],""to"":[57,67,94,106],""identify"":[58],""and"":[59],""remove"":[60],""error"":[61,76],""signal,"":[64],""our"":[65,92],""aim"":[66],""reproduce"":[68],""signal"":[70],""in"":[71],""its"":[72,75],""entirety,"":[73],""including"":[74],""properties."":[77],""Instead"":[78],""physically"":[80],""modeling"":[81],""behavior,"":[83],""data-driven"":[85],""approach"":[86,93],""taken."":[88],""implementation"":[90],""simulate"":[95],""simple"":[97],""but"":[98,119],""noisy"":[99],""laser"":[100],""rangefinder"":[101],""described."":[103],""Finally,"":[104],""approaches"":[105],""validate"":[107],""simulator"":[109],""are"":[110],""discussed."":[111],""compare"":[113],""not"":[114],""only"":[115],""raw"":[116],""predictions,"":[118],""also"":[120],""overall"":[121],""performance"":[122],""algorithms"":[124],""simulated"":[126],""versus"":[127],""data."":[129]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7140078""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icra/icra2015.html#TallavajhulaK15""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Robotics and Automation"",""VSN"":""ICRA"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140078"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Abhijeet"",""LN"":""Tallavajhula"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Alonzo"",""LN"":""Kelly"",""S"":2}],""BV"":""2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'trajectory', u'FId': 13662910}, {u'FN': u'calibration', u'FId': 165838908}, {u'FN': u'noise', u'FId': 198107850}, {u'FN': u'computational model', u'FId': 66024118}, {u'FN': u'embedded system', u'FId': 149635348}, {u'FN': u'computer vision', u'FId': 31972630}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",1483596592,,en,3,"[2167340365, 1512882103, 2115344791, 2058535340, 2007692097, 2123971866, 156975732, 2047692640, 1992854008, 1488180145, 2119946136, 2042012466, 2106092212, 2155620411, 1549967002]",construction and validation of a high fidelity simulator for a planar range sensor,0,"[u'construction', u'fidelity', u'high', u'planar', u'range', u'sensor', u'simulator', u'validation']",2015,"We study the problem of building a sensor model for the purpose of simulation. Our work is motivated by the potential impact of realistic simulators on the development cycle of software for real robots. The case is made for building models from approximate state information, relieving the burden of ground truth. Unlike calibration, where the goal is to identify and remove error from a signal, our aim to reproduce the signal in its entirety, including its error properties.

Component-based modeling can be used to split large models into partial models to reduce modeling complexity. Yet, verification results also need to transfer from components to composites. In this paper, we propose a component-based hybrid system verification approach that combines the advantages of component-based modeling e.g., reduced model complexity with the advantages of formal verification e.g., guaranteed contract compliance. Our strategy is to decompose the system into components, verify their local safety individually and compose them to form an overall system that provably satisfies a global contract, without proving the whole system. We introduce the necessary formalism to define the structure and behavior of components and a technique how to compose components such that safety properties provably emerge from component

In this paper we determine the geometric configurations under which the advice given by ACAS X is safe under a precise set of assumptions and formally verify these configurations using hybrid systems theorem proving techniques. We conduct an initial examination of the current version of the real ACAS X system and discuss some cases where our safety theorem conflicts with the actual advisory given by that version, demonstrating how formal, hybrid approaches are helping ensure the safety of ACAS X.

cyber-physical systems. Theorem provers based on differential dynamic logic have been used to verify safety properties for models of self-driving cars and collision avoidance protocols for aircraft. Unfortunately, these theorem provers do not have explicit proof terms, which makes the implementation of a number of important features unnecessarily complicated without soundness-critical and extra-logical extensions to the theorem prover. Examples include: an unambiguous separation between proof checking and proof search, the ability to extract program traces corresponding to counter-examples, and synthesis of surely-live deterministic programs from liveness proofs for nondeterministic programs. This paper presents a differential dynamic logic with such an explicit representation of proofs. The resulting logic extends both the syntax and semantics of differential dynamic logic with proof terms -- syntactic representations of logical deductions.

Based on the notion of discrete abstraction, our method eliminates unsoundness and unnecessary coarseness found in existing approaches for computing abstractions for non-linear continuous systems and is able to construct invariants with intricate boolean structure, in contrast to invariants typically generated using template-based methods. In order to tackle the state explosion problem associated with discrete abstraction, we present invariant generation algorithms that exploit sound proof rules for safety verification, such as differential cut$${\text {DC}}$$, and a new proof rule that we call differential divide-and-conquer$${\text {DDC}}$$, which splits the verification problem into smaller sub-problems. The resulting invariant generation method is observed to be much more scalable and efficient than the naive approach, exhibiting orders of magnitude performance improvement on many of the problems.",1106,andre platzer,computer science department,59dc7e262bdc9e77bc6d2115,wos_cs_335,,,msa_2295906355,-20.723,wos_pm,wos_cs_335,0259,"[{u'AuId': 2016064182, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'andre platzer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Andr\xe9 Platzer'}]","{u'CN': u'cade', u'CId': 1134440762}",15,"{u'CIId': 183156085, u'CIN': u'cade 2015'}",2015-03-06,"{""DN"":""A Uniform Substitution Calculus for Differential Dynamic Logic"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":137,""InvertedIndex"":{""This"":[0],""paper"":[1,112],""introduces"":[2,113],""a"":[3,19,24,27,67],""new"":[4],""proof"":[5,20],""calculus"":[6,64],""for"":[7,26,116],""differential"":[8,80,114,117,126,128],""dynamic"":[9,81,118],""logic"":[10,82,119],""(dL)"":[11],""that"":[12,22,120],""is"":[13,83],""entirely"":[14],""based"":[15],""on"":[16,38,56],""uniform"":[17,87,109],""substitution,"":[18],""rule"":[21],""substitutes"":[23],""formula"":[25],""predicate"":[28],""symbol"":[29],""everywhere."":[30],""Uniform"":[31],""substitutions"":[32,88],""make"":[33,121],""it"":[34,122],""possible"":[35,123],""to"":[36,95,107,124],""rely"":[37],""axioms"":[39,134],""rather"":[40],""than"":[41],""axiom"":[42],""schemata,"":[43],""substantially"":[44],""simplifying"":[45],""implementations."":[46],""Instead"":[47],""of"":[48,60,70,79],""nontrivial"":[49],""schema"":[50],""variables"":[51],""and"":[52,89,130],""soundness-critical"":[53],""side"":[54],""conditions"":[55],""the"":[57,62,102],""occurrence"":[58],""patterns"":[59],""variables,"":[61],""resulting"":[63],""adopts"":[65],""only"":[66],""finite"":[68],""number"":[69],""ordinary"":[71],""dL"":[72],""formulas"":[73],""as"":[74,93,132],""axioms."":[75],""The"":[76],""static"":[77],""semantics"":[78],""captured"":[84],""exclusively"":[85],""in"":[86,98,135],""bound"":[90],""variable"":[91],""renamings"":[92],""opposed"":[94],""being"":[96],""spread"":[97],""delicate"":[99],""ways"":[100],""across"":[101],""prover"":[103],""implementation."":[104],""In"":[105],""addition"":[106],""sound"":[108],""substitutions,"":[110,129],""this"":[111],""forms"":[115],""internalize"":[125],""invariants,"":[127],""derivations"":[131],""first-class"":[133],""dL."":[136]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-21401-6_32.pdf""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3717&context=compsci""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_32""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1503.html#Platzer15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01981""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_32""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1503.01981""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://128.84.21.199/abs/1503.01981""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://repository.cmu.edu/compsci/2697/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1503.01981""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_32/fulltext.html""}],""VFN"":""Conference on Automated Deduction"",""VSN"":""CADE"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-319-21401-6_32"",""CC"":{""2047764386"":[""is would have been different for the simpler deﬁnition FV(;) = FV() [FV() There is a limit to the precision with which any static analysis can determine which variables are really read or written [12].

temporal property with a probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to stochastic discrete systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems and quickly become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem by combining randomized sampling of system traces (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing (i.e., testing against a probability threshold) or estimation (i.e., computing with high probability a value close to the true probability). We believe SMC is essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the verification problem is not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can usually be obtained much faster than with standard, exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our technique enables faster verification than state-of-the-art statistical techniques. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models.

We also introduce delay contracts, which describe the change relative to the time that has passed since the last value was exchanged. Together, these contracts can take into account what has changed between two components in a given amount of time since the last exchange of information.

For any horizon Tand initial state ˘, fcan be replaced in similar ways by a bounded function without changing the game [22], since fis continuous by Def.1.

Alternatively, the global bounding with x0= x3y=(1+ p (x3y)2), which does not change the game outcome [22], proves as well. These simple proofs entail for all nonanticipative strategies, the existence of measurable control functions to win the game.

When hybrid systems are complicated, it is useful to prove properties about simpler and related subsystems before tackling the system as a whole. 2. Some models of hybrid systems can be implementation-specific. Verification can be aided by abstracting the system down to the core components necessary for safety, but only if the relations between the abstraction and the original system can be guaranteed. 3. One approach to taming the complexities of hybrid systems is to start with a simplified version of the system and iteratively expand it. However, this approach can be costly, since every iteration has to be proved safe from scratch, unless refinement relations can be leveraged in the proof. 4. When proofs become large, it is difficult to maintain a modular or comprehensible proof structure. By using a refinement relation to arrange proofs hierarchically according to the structure of natural subsystems, we can increase the readability and modularity of the resulting proof. dRL extends an existing specification and verification language for hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic, dL) by adding a refinement relation to directly compare hybrid systems.

If the vehicles follow each other at a close distance, they have better wireless reception but collisions may occur when a follower car does not receive notice about the decelerations of the leader car fast enough to react before it is too late. If the vehicles are farther apart, they would have a bigger safety margin, but the wireless communication drops out more often, so that the follower car no longer receives what the leader car is doing. In order to guarantee safety, such a system must return control to the driver if it does not receive an update from a nearby vehicle within some timeout period. The value of this timeout parameter encodes a tradeoff between the likelihood that an update is received and the maximum safe acceleration. Combining formal verification techniques for hybrid systems with a wireless communication model, we analyze how the expected efficiency of a provably-safe adaptive cruise control system is affected by the value of this timeout.",1162,andre platzer,computer science department,,,,msa_2088607916,msa_2088607916,-21.261,msa,msa_2088607916,01930,"[{u'AuId': 2125188987, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon

Still, it is challenging to guarantee that such a controller works properly under every circumstance. In tough scenarios where a large number of aircraft must execute a collision avoidance maneuver, a human pilot under stress is not necessarily able to understand the complexity of the distributed system and may not take the right course, especially if actions must be taken quickly. We consider a class of distributed collision avoidance controllers designed to work even in environments with arbitrarily many aircraft or UAVs. We prove that the controllers never allow the aircraft to get too close to one another, even when new planes approach an in-progress avoidance maneuver that the new plane may not be aware of.

We demonstrate how our new approach can be used to complete verification tasks that lie out of the reach of existing automatic verification approaches using several examples, including one involving an automotive powertrain control system.",1296,andre platzer,computer science department,,,,msa_1958676488,msa_1958676488,-20.835,msa,msa_1958676488,02171,"[{u'AuId': 2016064182, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'andre platzer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Andre Platzer'}]",,0,,2015-11-01,"{""DN"":""How to prove hybrid systems and why that matters"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":36,""InvertedIndex"":{""This"":[0],""invited"":[1],""talk"":[2],""provides"":[3],""a"":[4],""brief"":[5],""exposition"":[6],""how"":[7],""hybrid"":[8,13],""systems"":[9,14],""proving"":[10],""works,"":[11],""why"":[12],""verification"":[15],""is"":[16,34],""an"":[17,29],""important"":[18],""device"":[19],""to"":[20],""ensure"":[21],""the"":[22],""safety"":[23],""of"":[24],""complex"":[25],""systems,"":[26],""and"":[27],""gives"":[28],""idea"":[30],""where"":[31],""that"":[32],""technology"":[33],""successful."":[35]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7385983""}],""DOI"":""10.1109/ComplexSys.2015.7385983"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Andre"",""LN"":""Platzer"",""S"":1}],""BV"":""2015 International Conference on Complex Systems Engineering (ICCSE)"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2246581916,,,3,"[1995691455, 1977444293, 2107872611, 2033455284, 1504756454, 1575486920, 1581387743, 2153173530, 19888102, 300871591, 2080884201, 1968813561, 1590463358, 2155985201, 1941921537, 2280000660, 1901338635, 2105863608, 2395377831, 2396135746, 1564258448]",how to prove hybrid systems and why that matters,0,"[u'hybrid', u'matters', u'prove', u'systems', u'why']",2015,"This invited talk provides a brief exposition how hybrid systems proving works, why hybrid systems verification is an important device to ensure the safety of complex systems, and gives an idea where that technology is successful.",230,andre platzer,computer science department,59dcb9732bdc9e7b0a6ff4b7,wos_cs_507,,,msa_2246581916,-21.561,wos_pm,wos_cs_507,02193,"[{u'AuId': 1851097240, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'khalil ghorbal', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Khalil Ghorbal'}, {u'AuId': 2125188987, u'AfN': u'cornell university', u'DAfN': u'Cornell University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jeanbaptiste jeannin', u'AfId': 205783295, u'DAuN': u'Jean-Baptiste Jeannin'}, {u'AuId': 2130020205, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'erik zawadzki', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Erik Zawadzki'}, {u'AuId': 2016064182, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'andre platzer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Andr\xe9 Platzer'}, {u'AuId': 2134462204, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'geoffrey j gordon', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Geoffrey J.

Applications can be found in consumer robotics, in road, rail, and air transportation, manufacturing, and military operations. Unfortunately, the approaches to modeling and analyzing the behavior of dynamic spatial systems are just as diverse as these application domains. In this article, we discuss reasoning approaches for the medium-term control of autonomous agents in dynamic spatial systems, which requires a sufficiently detailed description of the agent’s behavior and environment but may still be conducted in a qualitative manner. We survey logic-based qualitative and hybrid modeling and commonsense reasoning approaches with respect to their features for describing and analyzing dynamic spatial systems in general, and the actions of autonomous agents operating therein in particular. We introduce a conceptual reference model, which summarizes the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic spatial systems based on a catalog of evaluation criteria derived from the model. We assess the modeling features provided by logic-based qualitative commonsense and hybrid approaches for projection, planning, simulation, and verification of dynamic spatial systems. We provide a comparative summary of the modeling features, discuss lessons learned, and introduce a research roadmap for integrating different approaches of dynamic spatial system analysis to achieve coverage of all required features.",1542,andre platzer,computer science department,,,,msa_2025587368,msa_2025587368,-20.982,msa,msa_2025587368,02887,"[{u'AuId': 1527728240, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon

cyber-physical systems (CPS) safe. Formal methods make strong guarantees about the system behavior if accurate models of the system can be obtained, including models of the controller and of the physical dynamics. In CPS, models are essential; but any model we could possibly build necessarily deviates from the real world. If the real system fits to the model, its behavior is guaranteed to satisfy the correctness properties verified with respect to the model. Otherwise, all bets are off. This article introduces ModelPlex, a method ensuring that verification results about models apply to CPS implementations. ModelPlex provides correctness guarantees for CPS executions at runtime: it combines offline verification of CPS models with runtime validation of system executions for compliance with the model. ModelPlex ensures in a provably correct way that the verification results obtained for the model apply to the actual system runs by monitoring the behavior of the world for compliance with the model. If, at some point, the observed behavior no longer complies with the model so that offline verification results no longer apply, ModelPlex initiates provably safe fallback actions, assuming the system dynamics deviation is bounded. This article, furthermore, develops a systematic technique to synthesize provably correct monitors automatically from CPS proofs in differential dynamic logic by a correct-by-construction approach, leading to verifiably correct runtime model validation.

u'physical', u'systems', u'verification']",2013,"Complex systems are designed using the model-based design paradigm in which mathematical models of systems are created and checked against specifications. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are complex systems in which the physical environment is sensed and controlled by computational or cyber elements possibly distributed over communication networks. Various aspects of CPS design such as physical dynamics, software, control, and communication networking must interoperate correctly for correct functioning of the systems. Modeling formalisms, analysis techniques and tools for designing these different aspects have evolved ind ependently, and remain dissimilar and disparate. There is no unifying formalism in which one can model all these aspects equally well. Therefore, model-based design of CPS must make use of a collection of models in several different formalisms and use respective analysis methods and tools together to ensure correct system design. To enable doing this in a formal manner, this thesis develops a framework for multi-model verification of cyber-physical systems based on behavioral semantics. Heterogeneity arising from the different interacting aspects of CPS design must be addressed in order to enable system-level verification. In current practice, there is no principled approach that deals with this modeling heterogeneity within a formal framework. We develop behavioral semantics to address heterogeneity in a general yet formal manner. Our framework makes no assumptions about the specifics of any particular formalism, therefore it readily supports various formalisms, techniques and tools. Models can be analyzed independently in isolation, supporting separation of concerns. Mappings across heterogeneous semantic domains enable associations between analysis results. Interdependencies across different models and specifications can be formally represented as constraints over parameters and verification can be carried out in a semantically consistent manner. Composition of analysis results is supported both hierarchically across different levels of abstraction and structurally into interacting component models at a given level of abstraction. The theoretical concepts developed in the thesis are illustrated using a case study on the hierarchical heterogeneous verification of an automotive intersection collision avoidance system.",2377,andre platzer,computer science department,,,,msa_5990255,msa_5990255,-21.891,msa,msa_5990255,03100,"[{u'AuId': 2702479850, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'nikos arechiga', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Nikos Arechiga'}, {u'AuId': 2153876304, u'AfN': u'toyota', u'DAfN': u'Toyota', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'james kapinski', u'AfId': 1293612202, u'DAuN': u'James Kapinski'}, {u'AuId': 2144050692, u'AfN': u'toyota', u'DAfN': u'Toyota', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'jyotirmoy v deshmukh', u'AfId': 1293612202, u'DAuN': u'Jyotirmoy V.

There is often a gap, however, between the type of assistance that a theorem prover requires to make progress on a proof task and the assistance that a system designer is able to provide. To address this deficiency we present an extension to the deductive verification framework of differential dynamic logic that allows the theorem prover KeYmaera to locally reason about behaviors by leveraging forward invariant sets provided by external methods, such as numerical techniques and designer insights. Our key contribution is a new inference rule, the forward invariant cut rule, introduced into the proof calculus of KeYmaera. We demonstrate the cut rule in action on an example involving an automotive powertrain control systems, in which we make use of a simulation-driven numerical technique to compute a local barrier function.",955,andre platzer,computer science department,,,,msa_2214315794,msa_2214315794,-21.202,msa,msa_2214315794,03622,"[{u'AuId': 1527728240, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'stefan mitsch', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Stefan Mitsch'}, {u'AuId': 297534524, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jandavid quesel', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jan-David Quesel'}, {u'AuId': 2016064182, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'andre platzer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Andr\xe9 Platzer'}]","{u'CN': u'fm', u'CId': 1169806927}",3,"{u'CIId': 185118762, u'CIN': u'fm 2014'}",2014-05-12,"{""DN"":""Refactoring, Refinement, and Reasoning"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":171,""InvertedIndex"":{""Refactoring"":[0],""of"":[1,30,38,44,52,60,104,115,126,131,138],""code"":[2],""is"":[3,156],""a"":[4,36,129,148],""common"":[5,23],""device"":[6],""in"":[7,24,117],""software"":[8],""engineering."":[9],""As"":[10,94],""cyber-physical"":[11],""systems"":[12],""CPS"":[13,25,31,45,83],""become"":[14,21],""ever"":[15],""more"":[16,22],""complex,"":[17],""similar"":[18],""engineering"":[19],""practices"":[20],""development."":[26],""Proper"":[27],""safe"":[28],""developments"":[29],""designs"":[32],""are"":[33,54,152],""accompanied"":[34],""by"":[35,112,145],""proof"":[37,160],""correctness."":[39],""Since"":[40],""the"":[41,61,95,102,124,165,168],""inherent"":[42],""complexities"":[43],""practically"":[46],""mandate"":[47],""iterative"":[48],""development,"":[49],""frequent"":[50],""changes"":[51],""models"":[53,63],""standard"":[55],""practice,"":[56],""but"":[57],""require"":[58],""reverification"":[59],""resulting"":[62],""after"":[64],""every"":[65],""change.\r\n\r\nTo"":[66],""overcome"":[67],""this"":[68,155],""issue,"":[69],""we"":[70,78,99,122,140,158],""develop"":[71],""proof-aware"":[72],""refactorings"":[73],""for"":[74,162],""CPS."":[75],""That"":[76],""is,"":[77],""study"":[79],""model"":[80,105],""transformations"":[81,106],""on"":[82,91,107,128,147],""and"":[84,133],""show"":[85,100],""how"":[86,101],""they"":[87,151],""correspond"":[88],""to"":[89],""relations"":[90],""correctness"":[92,108],""proofs."":[93],""main"":[96],""technical"":[97],""device,"":[98],""impact"":[103],""can"":[109,141],""be"":[110],""characterized"":[111],""different"":[113],""notions"":[114],""refinement"":[116,169],""differential"":[118],""dynamic"":[119],""logic."":[120],""Furthermore,"":[121],""demonstrate"":[123],""application"":[125],""refinements"":[127],""series"":[130],""safety-preserving"":[132],""liveness-preserving"":[134],""refactorings."":[135],""For"":[136],""some"":[137],""these"":[139],""give"":[142],""strong"":[143],""results"":[144],""proving"":[146],""meta-level"":[149],""that"":[150,164],""correct."":[153],""Where"":[154],""impossible,"":[157],""construct"":[159],""obligations"":[161],""showing"":[163],""refactoring"":[166],""respects"":[167],""relation."":[170]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-06410-9_33.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_33""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2962321""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_33""}],""VFN"":""Formal Methods"",""VSN"":""FM"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-319-06410-9_33"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Stefan"",""LN"":""Mitsch"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Jan-David"",""LN"":""Quesel"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""André"",""LN"":""Platzer"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on FM 2014: Formal Methods - Volume 8442"",""BT"":""p""}",3,"[{u'FN': u'a normal form', u'FId': 36758504}, {u'FN': u'programming language', u'FId': 199360897}, {u'FN': u'algorithm', u'FId': 11413529}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",94549128,,en,0,"[2153887189, 2110425399, 2159181605, 1971486022, 1659060819, 2127574686, 1487664366, 1483893502, 2293924086, 1510918931, 1535116423, 1994348879, 2153173530, 2074794556, 19888102, 2080884201, 159136752, 2155985201, 2101389394, 1582464544, 1977656637, 2067761716, 2016063209, 2001570688, 2405024592, 1983779606, 129487540, 2479226226]",refactoring refinement and reasoning,0,"[u'reasoning', u'refactoring', u'refinement']",2014,"Refactoring of code is a common device in software engineering. As cyber-physical systems CPS become ever more complex, similar engineering practices become more common in CPS development. Proper safe developments of CPS designs are accompanied by a proof of correctness. Since the inherent complexities of CPS practically mandate iterative development, frequent changes of models are standard practice, but require reverification of the resulting models after every change.To overcome this issue, we develop proof-aware refactorings for CPS. That is, we study model transformations on CPS and show how they correspond to relations on correctness proofs. As the main technical device, we show how the impact of model transformations on correctness can be characterized by different notions of refinement in differential dynamic logic. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of refinements on a series of safety-preserving and liveness-preserving refactorings. For some of these we can give strong results by proving on a meta-level that they are correct.

Some evidence indicates that modifying a practice that has been successful in one environment will introduce problems, undercut its effectiveness and harm the performance of the recipient unit. Other evidence, though, suggests that recipients need to adapt the practice to fit their local environment. The current research introduces a contingency perspective on practice transfer, holding that the value of modifications depends on when they are introduced and who introduces them.

This paper contributes a systematic crowdsourcing approach for eliciting multiple constraints inherent in a problem and using those constraints to find inspirations useful in solving it. To do so we identify methods to elicit useful constraints at different levels of abstraction, and empirical results that identify how the level of abstraction influences creative idea generation.

domains are all faced with the challenge of capturing information they find for later use. However, saving information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use. Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices. In a two part user study we find that this approach reduced selection time and was preferred by participants over the default system text selection method.",1368,aniket kittur,human-computer interaction institute,59dc7d402bdc9e77bc6cf98f,wos_cs_282,,,msa_2533819458,-21.434,wos_pm,wos_cs_282,01783,"[{u'AuId': 2668433552, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jaemin chun', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jaemin Chun'}, {u'AuId': 2148616380, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'seungjun kim', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'SeungJun Kim'}, {u'AuId': 2111246749, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'anind k dey', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Anind K.

Recent work on audit games models the strategic interaction between an auditor with a single audit resource and auditees as a Stackelberg game, augmenting associated well-studied security games with a configurable punishment parameter. We significantly generalize this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations, thus enabling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The main technical novelty is in the design and correctness proof of an optimization transformation that enables the construction of this FPTAS. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that this transformation significantly speeds up computation of solutions for a class of audit games and security games.",1087,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_1636310606,msa_1636310606,-20.947,msa,msa_1636310606,0693,"[{u'AuId': 2088834503, u'AfN': u'harvard university', u'DAfN': u'Harvard University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'andrew mao', u'AfId': 136199984, u'DAuN': u'Andrew Mao'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

Most past algorithms leveraged an assumption of submodularity that captures diminishing returns to scale. While submodularity is natural in many domains, early stages of innovation adoption are often better characterized by convexity, which is evident for renewable technologies, such as rooftop solar. We formulate a dynamic influence maximization problem under increasing returns to scale over a finite time horizon, in which the decision maker faces a budget constraint. We propose a simple algorithm in this model which chooses the best time period to use up the entire budget (called Best-Stage), and prove that this policy is optimal in a very general setting. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for this problem of which Best-Stage decision is a special case. Additionally, we experimentally verify that the proposed ""best-time"" algorithm remains quite effective even as we relax the assumptions under which optimality can be proved.

In this paper we model the problem via Markov decision processes (MDP), where the states of the MDP coincide with preference profiles and a (deterministic, stationary) policy corresponds to a social choice function. We can therefore employ the axioms studied in the social choice literature as guidelines in the design of socially desirable policies. We present tractable algorithms that compute optimal policies under different prominent social choice constraints.

To answer this question we adopt a novel algorithmic approach, proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model. Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols -- which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols -- is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria. Moreover, we observe that the (approximate) equilibria of proportional protocols -- which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake -- must be (approximately) proportional, and design a GCC protocol where all Nash equilibrium outcomes satisfy the stronger fairness notion of envy-freeness. Finally, we show that under an obliviousness restriction, which still allows the computation of approximately envy-free allocations, GCC protocols are guaranteed to have exact subgame perfect Nash equilibria.",1156,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_1583010304,msa_1583010304,-22.288,msa,msa_1583010304,01801,"[{u'AuId': 881907182, u'AfN': u'aarhus university', u'DAfN': u'Aarhus University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'simina br\xe2nzei', u'AfId': 204337017, u'DAuN': u'Simina Br\xe2nzei'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

As they interact with the robot, they infer the robot's capabilities and partially adapt to the robot, i.e., they might change their actions based on the observed outcomes and the robot's actions, without replicating the robot's policy. We present a game-theoretic model of human partial adaptation to the robot, where the human responds to the robot's actions by maximizing a reward function that changes stochastically over time, capturing the evolution of their expectations of the robot's capabilities. The robot can then use this model to decide optimally between taking actions that reveal its capabilities to the human and taking the best action given the information that the human currently has. We prove that under certain observability assumptions, the optimal policy can be computed efficiently. We demonstrate through a human subject experiment that the proposed model significantly improves human-robot team performance, compared to policies that assume complete adaptation of the human to the robot.",1107,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_2581799494,msa_2581799494,-19.976,msa,msa_2581799494,02107,"[{u'AuId': 2137000917, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'avrim blum', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Avrim Blum'}, {u'AuId': 2158078532, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'anupam gupta', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Anupam Gupta'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

This is a special case of stochastic k-set packing, where the problem is to find a maximum packing of sets, each of which exists with some probability. In this paper, we provide edge and set query algorithms for these two problems, respectively, that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimal solution. Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching (i.e., 2-set packing) problem is the design of an  adaptive  algorithm that queries only a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a (1-e) fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, for an arbitrarily small e > 0. Moreover, this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only a constant number of rounds. We complement this result with a  non-adaptive  (i.e., one round of queries) algorithm that achieves a (0.5 - e) fraction of the omniscient optimum. We also extend both our results to stochastic k-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a (2/k - e) fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, again with only O(1) queries per element. This guarantee is close to the best known polynomial-time approximation ratio of 3/k+1 -e for the  deterministic  k-set packing problem [Furer 2013].

In cyber-security applications, however, a key consideration largely ignored in this literature is stealth. In particular, an attacker who has a specific target in mind succeeds only if the target is reached before the malicious payload is detected and corresponding countermeasures deployed. The dual side of this problem is deployment of a limited number of monitoring units, such as cyber-forensics specialists, to limit the success of such targeted and stealthy diffusion processes. We investigate the problem of optimal monitoring of targeted stealthy diffusion processes. While natural variants of this problem are NP-hard, we show that if stealthy diffusion starts from randomly selected nodes, the defender’s objective is submodular and can be approximately optimized. In addition, we present approximation algorithms for the setting where the choice of the starting point is adversarial. We further extend our results to settings where the diffusion starts at multiple-seed nodes simultaneously, and where there is an inherent delay in detecting the infection. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are highly effective and scalable.",1332,ariel procaccia,computer science department,59dc7ff32bdc9e77bc6d72bf,wos_cs_441,,,msa_2587950115,-21.649,wos_pm,wos_cs_441,02907,"[{u'AuId': 2097706674, u'AfN': u'university of southern california', u'DAfN': u'University of Southern California', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'albert xin jiang', u'AfId': 1174212, u'DAuN': u'Albert Xin Jiang'}, {u'AuId': 2142054897, u'AfN': u'university of southern california', u'DAfN': u'University of Southern California', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'thanh hong nguyen', u'AfId': 1174212, u'DAuN': u'Thanh Hong Nguyen'}, {u'AuId': 2237142500, u'AfN': u'university of southern california', u'DAfN': u'University of Southern California', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'milind tambe', u'AfId': 1174212, u'DAuN': u'Milind Tambe'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

In real-world security settings the adversaries are humans and are thus boundedly rational. Most existing approaches for computing defender strategies against boundedly rational adversaries try to optimize against specific behavioral models of adversaries, and provide no quality guarantee when the estimated model is inaccurate. We propose a new solution concept, monotonic maximin, which provides guarantees against all adversary behavior models satisfying monotonicity, including all in the family of Regular Quantal Response functions.

It is commonly assumed that the utility is a ""nice"" known analytic function, for example, continuous and concave. In many domains, such as marketing, increased availability of computational resources and data has enabled the development of sophisticated simulations to evaluate the impact of allocating a fixed budget among alternatives (e.g., marketing channels) on outcomes, such as demand. While simulations enable high resolution evaluation of alternative budget allocation strategies, they significantly complicate the associated budget optimization problem. In particular, simulation runs are time consuming, significantly limiting the space of options that can be explored. An important second challenge is the common presence of budget complementarities, where non-negligible budget increments are required for an appreciable marginal impact from a channel. This introduces a combinatorial structure on the decision space. We propose to address these challenges by first converting the problem into a multi-choice knapsack optimization problem with unknown weights. We show that if weights (corresponding to marginal impact thresholds for each channel) are well approximated, we can achieve a solution within a factor of 2 of optimal, and this bound is tight. We then develop several parsimonious query algorithms for achieving this approximation in an online fashion. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",1555,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_2621230859,msa_2621230859,-21.686,msa,msa_2621230859,03054,"[{u'AuId': 1512084719, u'AfN': u'microsoft', u'DAfN': u'Microsoft', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ian a kash', u'AfId': 1290206253, u'DAuN': u'Ian A.

For many reasons one might consider mechanisms, or social choice functions, that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual agents rather than their utility functions. In this context, one possible objective for a social choice function is the maximization of (expected) social welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings. We study such optimal social choice functions under three different models, and underscore the important role played by scoring functions. In our worst-case model, no assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the worst-case distortion-or degree to which the selected alternative does not maximize social welfare-of optimal (randomized) social choice functions. In our average-case model, we derive optimal functions under neutral (or impartial culture) probabilistic models. Finally, a very general learning-theoretic model allows for the computation of optimal social choice functions (i.e., ones that maximize expected social welfare) under arbitrary, sampleable distributions. In the latter case, we provide both algorithms and sample complexity results for the class of scoring functions, and further validate the approach empirically.",1390,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_2295870642,msa_2295870642,-20.353,msa,msa_2295870642,03216,"[{u'AuId': 2122410992, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jeremiah blocki', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jeremiah Blocki'}, {u'AuId': 2031211410, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'saranga komanduri', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Saranga Komanduri'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

Usability studies have demonstrated that existing password composition policies can sometimes result in weaker password distributions; hence a more  principled  approach is needed. We introduce the  first theoretical model  for optimizing password composition policies. We study the computational and sample complexity of this problem under different assumptions on the structure of policies and on users' preferences over passwords. Our main positive result is an algorithm that -- with high probability --- constructs almost optimal policies (which are specified as a union of subsets of allowed passwords), and requires only a small number of samples of users' preferred passwords. We complement our theoretical results with simulations using a real-world dataset of 32 million passwords.",945,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_1992851378,msa_1992851378,-20.588,msa,msa_1992851378,03223,"[{u'AuId': 2137000917, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'avrim blum', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Avrim Blum'}, {u'AuId': 2015641818, u'AfN': u'university of patras', u'DAfN': u'University of Patras', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ioannis caragiannis', u'AfId': 174878644, u'DAuN': u'Ioannis Caragiannis'}, {u'AuId': 1563078655, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'nika haghtalab', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Nika Haghtalab'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

Toward this end, we formally adapt a recently introduced measure of the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency---the price of fairness---to the standard kidney exchange model. We show that the price of fairness in the standard theoretical model is small.

This growth results in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors. State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary compatibility graph.

Although Dodgson’s rule is one of the most well-studied voting rules, it suffers from serious deficiencies, both from the computational point of view—it is NP-hard even to approximate the Dodgson score within sublogarithmic factors—and from the social choice point of view—it fails basic social choice desiderata such as monotonicity and homogeneity. However, this does not preclude the existence of approximation algorithms for Dodgson that are monotonic or homogeneous, and indeed it is natural to ask whether such algorithms exist.   In this article, we give definitive answers to these questions. We design a monotonic exponential-time algorithm that yields a 2-approximation to the Dodgson score, while matching this result with a tight lower bound. We also present a monotonic polynomial-time O(log  m )-approximation algorithm (where  m  is the number of alternatives); this result is tight as well due to a complexity-theoretic lower bound. Furthermore, we show that a slight variation on a known voting rule yields a monotonic, homogeneous, polynomial-time O( m log  m )-approximation algorithm and establish that it is impossible to achieve a better approximation ratio even if one just asks for homogeneity. We complete the picture by studying several additional social choice properties; for these properties, we prove that algorithms with an approximation ratio that depends only on  m  do not exist.",1511,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_2084807538,msa_2084807538,-20.249,msa,msa_2084807538,04052,"[{u'AuId': 2292660923, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jonathan r goldman', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jonathan R.

Under additive valuations, we show that even when the number of goods is larger than the number of agents by a linear fraction, envy-free allocations are unlikely to exist.We then show that when the number of goods is larger by a logarithmic factor, such allocations exist with high probability. We support these results experimentally and show that the asymptotic behavior of the theory holds even when the number of goods and agents is quite small.

In particular, we prove that it selects allocations that are envy free up to one good --- a compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that the  MNW  solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and --- even more so --- in practice. While finding the  MNW  solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation, and demonstrate that it scales well on real data.

There are numerous papers that study the problem of fairly dividing a cake; a small number of them also take into account self-interested agents and consequent strategic issues, but these papers focus on fairness and consider a strikingly weak notion of truthfulness. In this paper we investigate the problem of cutting a cake in a way that is truthful, Pareto-efficient, and fair, where for the first time our notion of dominant strategy truthfulness is the ubiquitous one in social choice and computer science. We design both deterministic and randomized cake cutting mechanisms that are truthful and fair under different assumptions with respect to the valuation functions of the agents.",776,ariel procaccia,computer science department,,,,msa_2019516066,msa_2019516066,-18.795,msa,msa_2019516066,04581,"[{u'AuId': 2015641818, u'AfN': u'university of patras', u'DAfN': u'University of Patras', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ioannis caragiannis', u'AfId': 174878644, u'DAuN': u'Ioannis Caragiannis'}, {u'AuId': 160737525, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ariel d procaccia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ariel D.

In our setting, samples are supplied by strategic agents, who wish to pull the estimate as close as possible to their own value. In this setting, the sample mean gives rise to manipulation opportunities, whereas the sample median does not. Our key question is whether the sample median is the best (in terms of mean squared error) truthful estimator of the population mean. We show that when the underlying distribution is symmetric, there are truthful estimators that dominate the median.

Regular SGVB estimators rely on sampling of parameters once per minibatch of data, and have variance that is constant w.r.t. the minibatch size. The efficiency of such estimators can be drastically improved upon by translating uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence.We find an important connection with regularization by dropout: the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose \emph{variational dropout}, a generalization of Gaussian dropout, but with a more flexibly parameterized posterior, often leading to better generalization.

given votes that are seen as noisy estimates of a true ranking of the alternatives, the rule must reconstruct the most likely true ranking. We argue that this is too stringent a requirement, and instead ask:  How many  votes does a voting rule need to reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family of  pairwise-majority consistent rules , and show that for all rules in this family the number of samples required from the Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends to infinity (we call this property  accuracy in the limit ); this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction. We study families of noise models that are parametrized by distance functions, and find voting rules that are accurate in the limit for all noise models in such general families. We characterize the distance functions that induce noise models for which pairwise-majority consistent rules are accurate in the limit, and provide a similar result for another novel family of  position-dominance consistent  rules.

This is not just a theoretical question: many people have used the Spliddit website to obtain envy-free solutions to rent division instances. But envy freeness, in and of itself, is insufficient to guarantee outcomes that people view as intuitive and acceptable. We therefore focus on solutions that optimize a criterion of social justice, subject to the envy freeness constraint, in order to pinpoint the ``fairest'' solutions. We develop a general algorithmic framework that enables the computation of such solutions in polynomial time. We then study the relations between natural optimization objectives, and identify the maximin solution, which maximizes the minimum utility subject to envy freeness, as the most attractive. We demonstrate, in theory and using experiments on real data from Spliddit, that the maximin solution gives rise to significant gains in terms of our optimization objectives. Finally, a user study with Spliddit users as subjects demonstrates that people find the maximin solution to be significantly fairer than arbitrary envy-free solutions; this user study is unprecedented in that it asks people about their real-world rent division instances.

content-based image retrieval. The dominant color descriptor (DCD) represents a few perceptually dominant colors in an image through color quantization. For image retrieval based on DCD, the earth mover’s distance (EMD) and the optimal color composition distance were proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two images. Although providing good retrieval results, both methods are too time-consuming to be used in a large image database. To solve the problem, we propose a new distance function that calculates an approximate earth mover’s distance in linear time. To calculate the dissimilarity in linear time, the proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color space. To improve the accuracy, the proposed approach uses multiple curves and adjusts the color positions. As a result, our approach achieves order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors. We have performed extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results reveal that our approach achieves almost the same results with the EMD in linear time.",1167,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1996534565,msa_1996534565,-20.658,msa,msa_1996534565,0419,"[{u'AuId': 2102264230, u'AfN': u'hanyang university', u'DAfN': u'Hanyang University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jiwoon ha', u'AfId': 4575257, u'DAuN': u'Jiwoon Ha'}, {u'AuId': 2114304489, u'AfN': u'hanyang university', u'DAfN': u'Hanyang University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'sangwook kim', u'AfId': 4575257, u'DAuN': u'Sang-Wook Kim'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2132494940, u'AfN': u'yonsei university', u'DAfN': u'Yonsei University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'sunju park', u'AfId': 193775966, u'DAuN': u'Sunju Park'}]",,5,,2015-01-01,"{""DN"":""An analysis on information diffusion through BlogCast in a blogosphere"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":158,""InvertedIndex"":{""The"":[0],""increase"":[1],""in"":[2,13,32,40,49,78],""the"":[3,8,14,17,30,34,37,41,56,69,72,79,95,105,109,117,120,124,131,139,147,150,154],""number"":[4],""of"":[5,10,36,104,108,119,149,153],""bloggers"":[6,132],""and"":[7,26,126],""amount"":[9],""information"":[11,38,57,73,110,121],""diffused"":[12],""blogosphere"":[15,18,42],""makes"":[16],""an"":[19],""important"":[20],""medium"":[21],""through"":[22,59,123],""which"":[23],""to"":[24,88,101],""communicate"":[25],""exchange"":[27],""information."":[28],""Accordingly,"":[29],""interest"":[31],""understanding"":[33],""nature"":[35],""diffusion"":[39,58,74,111,122],""has"":[43,135],""also"":[44],""been"":[45,136],""increased."":[46],""Existing"":[47],""studies"":[48],""social"":[50],""networks"":[51],""have"":[52],""mainly"":[53],""focused"":[54],""on"":[55,94,130,138],""explicit"":[60,76,113],""relationships"":[61,77],""between"":[62],""members."":[63],""In"":[64,143],""this"":[65],""paper,"":[66],""we"":[67,145],""analyze"":[68,116],""causes"":[70,107],""for"":[71],""without"":[75,112],""blogosphere."":[80],""BlogCast,"":[81],""a"":[82,90],""functionality"":[83],""provided"":[84],""by"":[85],""blog-service"":[86],""providers"":[87],""expose"":[89],""high"":[91],""quality"":[92],""post"":[93,134],""portal"":[96,140],""main"":[97,106,141],""page,"":[98],""is"":[99],""found"":[100],""be"":[102],""one"":[103],""relationships."":[114],""We"":[115],""characteristics"":[118],""BlogCast"":[125,155],""its"":[127],""halo"":[128,151],""effect"":[129,152],""whose"":[133],""exposed"":[137],""page."":[142],""addition,"":[144],""examine"":[146],""sustainability"":[148],""over"":[156],""time."":[157]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025514008391""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isci/isci290.html#HaKKFP15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2724346""}],""VFN"":""Information Sciences"",""V"":290,""FP"":45,""LP"":62,""DOI"":""10.1016/j.ins.2014.08.042"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Jiwoon"",""LN"":""Ha"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Sang-Wook"",""LN"":""Kim"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Sunju"",""LN"":""Park"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""Information Sciences"",""BT"":""a""}",5,"[{u'FN': u'social network analysis', u'FId': 114713312}, {u'FN': u'internet privacy', u'FId': 108827166}, {u'FN': u'world wide web', u'FId': 136764020}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2023586012,"{u'JN': u'isci', u'JId': 192650101}",en,1,"[1854214752, 2061901927, 2061820396, 2087052656, 1601547964, 2114581929, 2122710250, 1972309850, 1973921702, 2175110005, 2027135291, 2109469951, 1495750374, 2042034885, 2117495845, 2054476043, 2162783380, 1489677531, 339285992, 2033314190, 2067932846, 2028055861, 2128914432, 1981086745, 178486096, 1971526329, 1606050636, 2041157860, 2080769514, 1573579329, 2058719535, 2124001423, 2026011086, 2021888117, 1964411685, 2022643974, 2066451303, 2000323957, 2026513874, 2079545094, 2008390373]",an analysis on information diffusion through blogcast in a blogosphere,0,"[u'blogcast', u'blogosphere', u'diffusion', u'information']",2015,"The increase in the number of bloggers and the amount of information diffused in the blogosphere makes the blogosphere an important medium through which to communicate and exchange information.

In this paper, we analyze the causes for the information diffusion without explicit relationships in the blogosphere. BlogCast, a functionality provided by blog-service providers to expose a high quality post on the portal main page, is found to be one of the main causes of the information diffusion without explicit relationships. We analyze the characteristics of the information diffusion through the BlogCast and its halo effect on the bloggers whose post has been exposed on the portal main page.

The success of such sites depends mainly on the contribution of a small number of expert users who provide a significant portion of the helpful answers, and so identifying users that have the potential of becoming strong contributers is an important task for owners of such communities.   We present a study of the popular Q&A website StackOverflow (SO), in which users ask and answer questions about software development, algorithms, math and other technical topics. The dataset includes information on 3.5 million questions and 6.9 million answers created by 1.3 million users in the years 2008--2012. Participation in activities on the site (such as asking and answering questions) earns users reputation, which is an indicator of the value of that user to the site.   We describe an analysis of the SO reputation system, and the participation patterns of high and low reputation users. The contributions of very high reputation users to the site indicate that they are the primary source of answers, and especially of high quality answers. Interestingly, we find that while the majority of questions on the site are asked by low reputation users, on average a high reputation user asks more questions than a user with low reputation. We consider a number of graph analysis methods for detecting influential and anomalous users in the underlying user interaction network, and find they are effective in detecting extreme behaviors such as those of  spam  users. Lastly, we show an application of our analysis: by considering user contributions over first months of activity on the site, we predict who will become influential long-term contributors.",1741,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1981552292,msa_1981552292,-19.15,msa,msa_1981552292,0595,"[{u'AuId': 2429858303, u'AfN': u'nec', u'DAfN': u'NEC', u'S': 1,

These two types of patterns are hidden and mixed in the time-varying activities. How can we robustly separate regular patterns and outliers, without requiring any prior information?We present CycloneM, a unifying model to capture both cyclic patterns and outliers, and CycloneFact, a novel algorithm which solves the above problem. We also present an automatic mining framework AutoCyclone, based on CycloneM and CycloneFact. Our method has the following properties; (a) effective: it captures important cyclic features such as trend and seasonality, and distinguishes regular patterns and rare events clearly; (b) robust and accurate: it detects the above features and patterns accurately against outliers; (c) fast: CycloneFact takes linear time in the data size and typically converges in a few iterations; (d) parameter free: our modeling framework frees the user from having to provide parameter values.Extensive experiments on 4 real datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model and algorithm, in that the model can capture latent cyclic patterns, trends and rare events, and the algorithm outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Extensive experiments on 67GB of real datasets demonstrate that AutoPlait does indeed detect meaningful patterns correctly, and it outperforms state-of-the-art competitors as regards accuracy and speed: AutoPlait achieves near-perfect, over 95% precision and recall, and it is up to 472 times faster than its competitors.",1110,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2077760583,msa_2077760583,-19.395,msa,msa_2077760583,0700,"[{u'AuId': 2124308955, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'miguel araujo', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Miguel Araujo'}, {u'AuId': 316694267, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'stephan gunnemann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Stephan G\xfcnnemann'}, {u'AuId': 2005448556, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'gonzalo mateos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Gonzalo Mateos'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'ecml', u'CId': 2755314191}",6,,2014-09-15,"{""DN"":""Beyond blocks: hyperbolic community detection"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":156,""InvertedIndex"":{""What"":[0],""do"":[1],""real"":[2,46,130],""communities"":[3,56,79,105,118],""in"":[4,15,39,89,116,129,136,145],""social"":[5,131],""networks"":[6,47],""look"":[7,35],""like?"":[8],""Community"":[9,71],""detection"":[10,33],""plays"":[11],""a"":[12,75,98,120,134,137],""key"":[13],""role"":[14],""understanding"":[16],""the"":[17,69,81],""structure"":[18,122],""of"":[19,78],""real-life"":[20],""graphs"":[21],""with"":[22,48,106,119,140],""impact"":[23],""on"":[24],""recommendation"":[25],""systems,"":[26],""load"":[27],""balancing"":[28],""and"":[29,80,86],""routing."":[30],""Previous"":[31],""community"":[32,135],""methods"":[34],""for"":[36],""uniform"":[37],""blocks"":[38],""adjacency"":[40],""matrices."":[41],""However,"":[42],""after"":[43],""studying"":[44],""four"":[45],""ground-truth"":[49],""communities,"":[50],""we"":[51],""provide"":[52],""empirical"":[53],""evidence"":[54],""that"":[55,111],""are"":[57],""best"":[58],""represented"":[59],""as"":[60,74],""having"":[61],""an"":[62],""hyperbolic"":[63,107],""structure."":[64,108],""We"":[65,109,126],""detail"":[66],""HyCoM"":[67],""-"":[68,73],""Hyperbolic"":[70],""Model"":[72],""better"":[76],""representation"":[77],""relationships"":[82],""between"":[83],""their"":[84],""members,"":[85],""show"":[87,110],""improvements"":[88],""compression"":[90],""compared"":[91],""to"":[92,103,123],""standard"":[93],""methods.\r\n\r\nWe"":[94],""also"":[95],""introduce"":[96],""HyCoM-FIT,"":[97],""fast,"":[99],""parameter"":[100],""free"":[101],""algorithm"":[102],""detect"":[104],""our"":[112],""method"":[113],""is"":[114],""effective"":[115],""finding"":[117],""similar"":[121],""self-declared"":[124],""ones."":[125],""report"":[127],""findings"":[128],""networks,"":[132],""including"":[133],""blogging"":[138],""platform"":[139],""over"":[141,152],""34"":[142],""million"":[143],""edges"":[144],""which"":[146],""more"":[147],""than"":[148],""1000"":[149],""users"":[150],""established"":[151],""300"":[153],""000"":[154],""relations."":[155]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44848-9_4.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2731542""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pkdd/pkdd2014-1.html#AraujoGMF14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4""}],""VFN"":""European conference on Machine Learning"",""VSN"":""ECML"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9_4"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Miguel"",""LN"":""Araujo"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Stephan"",""LN"":""Günnemann"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Gonzalo"",""LN"":""Mateos"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""ECMLPKDD'14 Proceedings of the 2014th European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases -

Community detection plays a key role in understanding the structure of real-life graphs with impact on recommendation systems, load balancing and routing. Previous community detection methods look for uniform blocks in adjacency matrices. However, after studying four real networks with ground-truth communities, we provide empirical evidence that communities are best represented as having an hyperbolic structure. We detail HyCoM - the Hyperbolic Community Model - as a better representation of communities and the relationships between their members, and show improvements in compression compared to standard methods.We also introduce HyCoM-FIT, a fast, parameter free algorithm to detect communities with hyperbolic structure. We show that our method is effective in finding communities with a similar structure to self-declared ones.

We examine the growth of several real networks, including one of the world's largest online social network, ``WeChat'', with  300 million  nodes and  4.75 billion  links by 2013; and we observe  power law  growth for both nodes and links, a fact that completely breaks the sigmoid models (like SI, and Bass). In its place, we propose NETTIDE, along with differential equations for the growth of the count of nodes, as well as links. Our model  accurately  fits the growth patterns of real graphs; it is  general , encompassing as special cases all the known, traditional models (including Bass, SI, log-logistic growth); while still remaining  parsimonious , requiring only a handful of parameters.

In this paper we describe Pegasus, a big graph mining system built on top of MapReduce, a modern distributed data processing platform. We introduce GIM-V, an important primitive that Pegasus uses for its algorithms to analyze structures of large graphs. We also introduce HEigen, a large scale eigensolver which is also a part of Pegasus. Both GIM-V and HEigen are highly optimized, achieving linear scale up on the number of machines and edges, and providing 9.2x and 76x faster performance than their naive counterparts, respectively.   Using Pegasus, we analyze very large, real world graphs with billions of nodes and edges.

Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs, including 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given dataset. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent reviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing successful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine these 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD) model, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Based on our model we formulate a likelihood-based suspiciousness metric, Normalized Expected Surprise Total (NEST). We propose a linear-time algorithm for performing Bayesian inference using our model and computing the metric. Experiments on real data show that BIRDNEST successfully spots review fraud in large, real-world graphs: the 50 most suspicious users of the Flipkart platform flagged by our algorithm were investigated and all identified as fraudulent by domain experts at Flipkart.",1245,christos faloutsos,computer science

anomalous, suspicious nodes judging only from their connectivity patterns? Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, C atch S ync , which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a)  synchronized  behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior patterns because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b)  rare  behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (“synchronicity” and “normality”) and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, C atch S ync  has the following desirable properties: (a) it is  scalable  to large datasets, being linear in the graph size; (b) it is  parameter free ; and (c) it is  side-information-oblivious : it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, and the like., while still capable of using side information if available. We applied C atch S ync  on three large, real datasets,  1-billion-edge  Twitter social graph,  3-billion-edge,  and  12-billion-edge  Tencent Weibo social graphs, and several synthetic ones; C atch S

suspicious nodes, judging only from their connectivity patterns? Suspicious graph patterns show up in many applications, from Twitter users who buy fake followers, manipulating the social network, to botnet members performing distributed denial of service attacks, disturbing the network traffic graph. We propose a fast and effective method, CatchSync, which exploits two of the tell-tale signs left in graphs by fraudsters: (a) synchronized behavior: suspicious nodes have extremely similar behavior pattern, because they are often required to perform some task together (such as follow the same user); and (b) rare behavior: their connectivity patterns are very different from the majority. We introduce novel measures to quantify both concepts (""synchronicity"" and ""normality"") and we propose a parameter-free algorithm that works on the resulting synchronicity-normality plots. Thanks to careful design, CatchSync has the following desirable properties: (a) it is scalable to large datasets, being linear on the graph size; (b) it is parameter free; and (c) it is side-information-oblivious: it can operate using only the topology, without needing labeled data, nor timing information, etc., while still capable of using side information, if available. We applied CatchSync on two large, real datasets 1-billion-edge Twitter social graph and 3-billion-edge Tencent Weibo social graph, and several synthetic ones; CatchSync consistently outperforms existing competitors, both in detection accuracy by 36% on Twitter and 20% on Tencent Weibo, as well as in speed.",1652,christos faloutsos,computer science

u'catchtartan', u'dynamic', u'multicontextual', u'representing', u'summarizing']",2016,"Representing and summarizing human behaviors with rich contexts facilitates behavioral sciences and user-oriented services. Traditional behavioral modeling represents a behavior as a tuple in which each element is one contextual factor of one type, and the tensor-based summaries look for high-order dense blocks by clustering the values (including timestamps) in each dimension. However, the human behaviors are multicontextual and dynamic: (1) each behavior takes place within multiple contexts in a few dimensions, which requires the representation to enable non-value and set-values for each dimension; (2) many behavior collections, such as tweets or papers, evolve over time. In this paper, we represent the behavioral data as a two-level matrix (temporal-behaviors by dimensional-values) and propose a novel representation for behavioral summary called Tartan that includes a set of dimensions, the values in each dimension, a list of consecutive time slices and the behaviors in each slice. We further develop a propagation method CatchTartan to catch the dynamic multicontextual patterns from the temporal multidimensional data in a principled and scalable way: it determines the meaningfulness of updating every element in the Tartan by minimizing the encoding cost in a compression manner. CatchTartan outperforms the baselines on both the accuracy and speed. We apply CatchTartan to four Twitter datasets up to 10 million tweets and the DBLP data, providing comprehensive summaries for the events, human life and scientific development.",1548,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2391440061,msa_2391440061,-19.845,msa,msa_2391440061,0897,"[{u'AuId': 2045447989, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'alex beutel', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alex Beutel'}, {u'AuId': 2647518971, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'kenton murray', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kenton Murray'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 1972291593, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'alexander j smola', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alexander J.

And how can we prevent spammers from tricking our algorithms into suggesting a bad movie? Is it possible to infer structure between movies simultaneously? In this paper we describe a unified Bayesian approach to Collaborative Filtering that accomplishes all of these goals. It models the discrete structure of ratings and is flexible to the often non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. Additionally, our method finds a co-clustering of the users and items, which improves the model's accuracy and makes the model robust to fraud. We offer three main contributions: (1) We provide a novel model and Gibbs sampling algorithm that accurately models the quirks of real world ratings, such as convex ratings distributions. (2) We provide proof of our model's robustness to spam and anomalous behavior. (3) We use several real world datasets to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting user's ratings, avoiding prediction skew in the face of injected spam, and finding interesting patterns in real world ratings data.",1163,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2167564468,msa_2167564468,-19.517,msa,msa_2167564468,0902,"[{u'AuId': 2131938950, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'sunhee kim', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Sun-Hee Kim'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2295751673, u'AfN': u'chonnam national university', u'DAfN': u'Chonnam National University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'hyungjeong yang', u'AfId': 111277659, u'DAuN': u'Hyung-Jeong Yang'}]",,10,,2013-01-01,"{""DN"":""Coercively Adjusted Auto Regression Model for Forecasting in Epilepsy EEG"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":127,""InvertedIndex"":{""Recently,"":[0],""data"":[1,16,100],""with"":[2,74],""complex"":[3],""characteristics"":[4,19,98],""such"":[5],""as"":[6],""epilepsy"":[7,58,107],""electroencephalography"":[8],""(EEG)"":[9],""time"":[10,60],""series"":[11],""has"":[12,17],""emerged."":[13],""Epilepsy"":[14],""EEG"":[15,59,108],""special"":[18,38,97],""including"":[20],""nonlinearity,"":[21],""nonnormality,"":[22],""and"":[23,76,125],""nonperiodicity."":[24],""Therefore,"":[25],""it"":[26],""is"":[27,81],""important"":[28],""to"":[29,83,101,116],""find"":[30],""a"":[31,45,56],""suitable"":[32],""forecasting"":[33],""method"":[34,50,95,121],""that"":[35,51,113],""covers"":[36],""these"":[37],""characteristics."":[39],""In"":[40],""this"":[41],""paper,"":[42],""we"":[43],""propose"":[44],""coercively"":[46],""adjusted"":[47],""autoregression"":[48],""(CA-AR)"":[49],""forecasts"":[52],""future"":[53,104],""values"":[54],""from"":[55],""multivariable"":[57],""series."":[61],""We"":[62,91],""use"":[63],""the"":[64,72,85,88,93,103,119],""technique"":[65],""of"":[66,87,99,106],""random"":[67],""coefficients,"":[68],""which"":[69],""forcefully"":[70],""adjusts"":[71],""coefficients"":[73],""−1"":[75],""1."":[77],""The"":[78],""fractal"":[79],""dimension"":[80],""used"":[82],""determine"":[84],""order"":[86],""CA-AR"":[89,94],""model."":[90],""applied"":[92],""reflecting"":[96],""forecast"":[102,123],""value"":[105],""data."":[109],""Experimental"":[110],""results"":[111],""show"":[112],""when"":[114],""compared"":[115],""previous"":[117],""methods,"":[118],""proposed"":[120],""can"":[122],""faster"":[124],""accurately."":[126]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/545613.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3655454/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/545613/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cmmm/cmmm2013.html#KimFY13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/545613""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3655454""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23710252""}],""VFN"":""Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine"",""V"":2013,""FP"":545613,""LP"":545613,""DOI"":""10.1155/2013/545613"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Sun-Hee"",""LN"":""Kim"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Hyung-Jeong"",""LN"":""Yang"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine"",""BT"":""a""}",10,"[{u'FN': u'electroencephalography', u'FId': 522805319}, {u'FN': u'regression analysis', u'FId': 152877465}, {u'FN': u'econometrics', u'FId': 149782125}, {u'FN': u'computational biology', u'FId': 70721500}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'psychology', u'FId': 15744967}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2120838210,"{u'JN': u'comput math method med', u'JId': 36980176}",en,1,"[2078206416, 2117014758, 2049287603, 2053744708, 2603516344, 2011304357, 2114942458, 2110661716, 2149320615, 2050102536, 2169812774, 2036801659, 2007945931, 390771207, 1986872133, 2049304293, 2167281592, 2097340811, 2040174397, 2026424972, 2147268071, 2098368581, 2169196231, 2118787601, 2055663768, 2115292859, 1987861243, 2097937682, 2087356873, 2000236114, 2101520055, 2135941726, 2027605884, 2069702787, 2037759858, 2048956316, 2014420339]",coercively adjusted auto regression model for forecasting in epilepsy eeg,0,"[u'adjusted', u'auto', u'coercively', u'eeg', u'epilepsy', u'forecasting', u'model', u'regression']",2013,"Recently, data with complex characteristics such as epilepsy electroencephalography (EEG) time series has emerged. Epilepsy EEG data has special characteristics including nonlinearity, nonnormality, and nonperiodicity. Therefore, it is important to find a suitable forecasting method that covers these special characteristics. In this paper, we propose a coercively adjusted autoregression (CA-AR) method that forecasts future values from a multivariable epilepsy EEG time series. We use the technique of random coefficients, which forcefully adjusts the coefficients with −1 and 1. The fractal dimension is used to determine the order of the CA-AR model. We applied the CA-AR method reflecting special characteristics of data to forecast the future value of epilepsy EEG data. Experimental results show that when compared to previous methods, the proposed method can forecast faster and accurately.",899,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2120838210,msa_2120838210,-20.196,msa,msa_2120838210,0924,"[{u'AuId': 2124308955, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'miguel araujo', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Miguel Araujo'}, {u'AuId': 2650391232, u'AfN': u'rutgers university', u'DAfN': u'Rutgers University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'spiros papadimitriou', u'AfId': 102322142, u'DAuN': u'Spiros Papadimitriou'}, {u'AuId': 316694267, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'stephan gunnemann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Stephan G\xfcnnemann'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2111459030, u'AfN': u'bbn technologies', u'DAfN': u'BBN Technologies', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'prithwish basu', u'AfId': 1289575342, u'DAuN': u'Prithwish Basu'}, {u'AuId': 2059211748, u'AfN': u'united states army research laboratory', u'DAfN': u'United States Army Research Laboratory', u'S': 6, u'AuN': u'ananthram swami', u'AfId': 166416128, u'DAuN': u'Ananthram Swami'}, {u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 7, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

We propose Com2, a novel and fast, incremental tensor analysis approach, which can discover both transient and periodic/ repeating communities. The method is (a) scalable, being linear on the input size (b) general, (c) needs no user-defined parameters and (d) effective, returning results that agree with intuition. We apply our method on real datasets, including a phone-call network and a computer-traffic network. The phone call network consists of 4 million mobile users, with 51 million edges (phonecalls), over 14 days. Com2 spots intuitive patterns, that is, temporal communities (comet communities). We report our findings, which include large star-like patterns, near-bipartite-cores, as well as tiny groups (5 users), calling each other hundreds of times within a few days.",878,christos

How do people join the social groups, uniformly or with burst? What is the pattern of people quitting from groups? Is there a simple universal model to depict the come-and-go patterns of various groups?   In this paper, we examine temporal evolution patterns of more than 100 thousands social groups with more than 10 million users. We surprisingly find that the evolution patterns of real social groups goes far beyond the classic dynamic models like SI and SIR. For example, we observe both diffusion and non-diffusion mechanism in the group joining process, and power-law decay in group quitting process, rather than exponential decay as expected in SIR model. Therefore we propose a new model  comeNgo , a concise yet flexible dynamic model for group evolution. Our model has the following advantages: (a) unification power: it generalizes earlier theoretical models and different joining and quitting mechanisms we find from observation. (b) succinctness and interpretability: it contains only six parameters with clear physical meanings. (c) accuracy: it can capture various kinds of group evolution patterns preciously and the goodness of fit increase by 58% over baseline.

Within the constraints of this scenario, we ask two key questions: (a) which meme will prevail? and (b) can one influence the outcome of the propagations? Our model is underpinned by two key concepts, a structural graph model (composite network) and a viral propagation model (SI 1 I 2 S). Using this framework, we formulate a non-linear dynamic system and perform an eigenvalue analysis to identify the tipping point of the epidemic behavior. Based on insights gained from this analysis, we demonstrate an effective and accurate prediction method to determine viral dominance, which we call the EigenPredictor. Next, using a combination of synthetic and real composite networks, we evaluate the effectiveness of various viral suppression techniques by either a) concurrently suppressing both memes or b) unilaterally suppressing a single meme while leaving the other relatively unaffected.",1015,christos faloutsos,computer science

depend on user generated content discern fraudulent input by spammers from legitimate input? In this paper we focus on the social network Facebook and the problem of discerning ill-gotten Page Likes, made by spammers hoping to turn a profit, from legitimate Page Likes. Our method, which we refer to as CopyCatch, detects lockstep Page Like patterns on Facebook by analyzing only the social graph between users and Pages and the times at which the edges in the graph (the Likes) were created. We offer the following contributions: (1) We give a novel problem formulation, with a simple concrete definition of suspicious behavior in terms of graph structure and edge constraints. (2) We offer two algorithms to find such suspicious lockstep behavior - one provably-convergent iterative algorithm and one approximate, scalable MapReduce implementation. (3) We show that our method severely limits ""greedy attacks"" and analyze the bounds from the application of the Zarankiewicz problem to our setting. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of CopyCatch at Facebook and on synthetic data, as well as potential extensions to anomaly detection problems in other domains. CopyCatch is actively in use at Facebook, searching for attacks on Facebook's social graph of over a billion users, many millions of Pages, and billions of Page Likes.",1375,christos

What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we use them for algorithm design and applications? A k-core is the maximal subgraph where all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns that are related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from several diverse domains. Our discoveries are as follows: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness of vertices (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated to their degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy of a graph (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists in the graph) obeys a 3-to-1 power law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy-cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core-periphery and communities. Our algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully finds anomalies in real-world graphs complementing densest-subgraph based anomaly detection methods. (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates the degeneracy of billion-scale graphs up to 7× faster than a recent multipass algorithm.(3) Core-S, inspired by Structured Core Pattern, identifies influential spreaders up to 17× faster than top competitors with comparable accuracy.",1552,christos faloutsos,computer science

Can we detect it when data are too large to fit in memory or even on a disk? Past studies have shown that dense blocks in real-world tensors (e.g., social media, Wikipedia, TCP dumps, etc.) signal anomalous or fraudulent behavior such as retweet boosting, bot activities, and network attacks. Thus, various approaches, including tensor decomposition and search, have been used for rapid and accurate dense-block detection in tensors. However, all such methods have low accuracy, or assume that tensors are small enough to fit in main memory, which is not true in many real-world applications such as social media and web.   To overcome these limitations, we propose D-Cube, a disk-based dense-block detection method, which also can be run in a distributed manner across multiple machines. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, D-Cube is (1) Memory Efficient: requires up to 1,600 times less memory and handles 1,000 times larger data (2.6TB), (2) Fast: up to 5 times faster due to its near-linear scalability with all aspects of data, (3) Provably Accurate: gives a guarantee on the densities of the blocks it finds, and (4) Effective: successfully spotted network attacks from TCP dumps and synchronized behavior in rating data with the highest accuracy.",1354,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2586047314,msa_2586047314,-20.267,msa,msa_2586047314,01149,"[{u'AuId': 1524801041, u'AfN': u'university of michigan', u'DAfN': u'University of Michigan', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'danai koutra', u'AfId': 27837315, u'DAuN': u'Danai Koutra'}, {u'AuId': 2397954333, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'neil shah', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Neil Shah'}, {u'AuId': 1980017490, u'AfN': u'johns hopkins university', u'DAfN': u'Johns Hopkins University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'joshua t vogelstein', u'AfId': 145311948, u'DAuN': u'Joshua T.

How different is the wiring of Bob’s brain (a left-handed male) and Alice’s brain (a right-handed female), and how is it different? Graph similarity with given node correspondence, i.e., the detection of changes in the connectivity of graphs, arises in numerous settings. In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose D elta C on , a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g., employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). In conjunction, we propose D elta C on -A ttr , a related approach that enables attribution of change or dissimilarity to responsible nodes and edges. Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures. Finally, we employ D elta C on  and D elta C on -A ttr  on real applications: (a) we classify people to groups of high and low creativity based on their brain connectivity graphs, (b) do temporal anomaly detection in the who-emails-whom Enron graph and find the top culprits for the changes in the temporal corporate email graph, and (c) recover pairs of test-retest large brain scans ( ∼17M edges, up to 90M edges) for 21 subjects.",1426,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2339085491,msa_2339085491,-19.906,msa,msa_2339085491,01165,"[{u'AuId': 2121553341, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yang weng', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yang Weng'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2072284226, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'marija d ilic', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Marija D.

Instead of taking the traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a data-driven method, leading to an effective topology estimation approach for the smart grid. Specifically, we first introduce the data-driven topology estimation problem. Then, a novel Logistic Kernel Regression is proposed in a Bayesian framework based on Nearest Neighbors search. Notably, unlike many machine learning approaches that do not account for physical constraints, and distinctive from deterministic engineering modeling defined solely by physical laws, this paper for the first time combines the two into one single regression modeling for topology estimation.

In this work, we formally state the axioms and desired properties of the graph similarity functions, and evaluate when state-of-the-art methods fail to detect crucial connectivity changes in graphs. We propose DeltaCon, a principled, intuitive, and scalable algorithm that assesses the similarity between two graphs on the same nodes (e.g. employees of a company, customers of a mobile carrier). Experiments on various synthetic and real graphs showcase the advantages of our method over existing similarity measures.

Can we detect it in real time, with an accuracy guarantee? Past studies have shown that dense subtensors tend to indicate anomalous or even fraudulent behavior in many tensor data, including social media, Wikipedia, and TCP dumps. Thus, several algorithms have been proposed for detecting dense subtensors rapidly and accurately. However, existing algorithms assume that tensors are static, while many real-world tensors, including those mentioned above, evolve over time.   We propose DENSESTREAM, an incremental algorithm that maintains and updates a dense subtensor in a tensor stream (i.e., a sequence of changes in a tensor), and DENSESALERT, an incremental algorithm spotting the sudden appearances of dense subtensors. Our algorithms are: (1)  Fast and ""any time"" : updates by our algorithms are up to  a million times faster  than the fastest batch algorithms, (2)  Provably accurate : our algorithms guarantee a lower bound on the density of the subtensor they maintain, and (3)  Effective : our DENSESALERT successfully spots anomalies in real-world tensors, especially those overlooked by existing

Since ratings are not static but given at various points in time, a temporal analysis of rating data provides deeper insights into the evolution of a product's quality. In this work, we tackle the following question: Given the time stamped rating data for a product or service, how can we detect the general rating behavior of users as well as time intervals where the ratings behave anomalous? We propose a Bayesian model that represents the rating data as sequence of categorical mixture models. In contrast to existing methods, our method does not require any aggregation of the input but it operates on the original time stamped data. To capture the dynamic effects of the ratings, the categorical mixtures are temporally constrained: Anomalies can occur in specific time intervals only and the general rating behavior should evolve smoothly over time. Our method automatically determines the intervals where anomalies occur, and it captures the temporal effects of the general behavior by using a state space model on the natural parameters of the categorical distributions. For learning our model, we propose an efficient algorithm combining principles from variational inference and dynamic programming. In our experimental study we show the effectiveness of our method and we present interesting discoveries on multiple real world datasets.",1424,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2020214545,msa_2020214545,-19.721,msa,msa_2020214545,01279,"[{u'AuId': 1935278117, u'AfN': u'science applications international corporation', u'DAfN': u'Science Applications International Corporation', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ted e senator', u'AfId': 880747138, u'DAuN': u'Ted E.

project by a team consisting of SAIC and four universities to develop, integrate, and evaluate new approaches to detect the weak signals characteristic of insider threats on organizations' information systems. Our system combines structural and semantic information from a real corporate database of monitored activity on their users' computers to detect independently developed red team inserts of malicious insider activities. We have developed and applied multiple algorithms for anomaly detection based on suspected scenarios of malicious insider behavior, indicators of unusual activities, high-dimensional statistical patterns, temporal sequences, and normal graph evolution. Algorithms and representations for dynamic graph processing provide the ability to scale as needed for enterprise-level deployments on real-time data streams. We have also developed a visual language for specifying combinations of features, baselines, peer groups, time periods, and algorithms to detect anomalies suggestive of instances of insider threat behavior. We defined over 100 data features in seven categories based on approximately 5.5 million actions per day from approximately 5,500 users. We have achieved area under the ROC curve values of up to 0.979 and lift values of 65 on the top 50 user-days identified on two months of real data.",1398,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1995976200,msa_1995976200,-19.049,msa,msa_1995976200,01287,"[{u'AuId': 2115305989, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'meng jiang', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Meng Jiang'}, {u'AuId': 2113115369, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'peng cui', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Peng Cui'}, {u'AuId': 2045447989, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'alex beutel', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alex Beutel'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2127183023, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'shiqiang yang', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Shiqiang Yang'}]","{u'CN': u'www', u'CId': 1135342153}",13,"{u'CIId': 123220197, u'CIN': u'www 2014'}",2014-04-07,"{""DN"":""Detecting suspicious following behavior in multimillion-node social networks"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":116,""InvertedIndex"":{""In"":[0],""a"":[1,9,76,112],""multimillion-node"":[2],""network"":[3],""of"":[4,12,54],""who-follows-whom"":[5],""like"":[6],""Twitter,"":[7],""since"":[8],""high"":[10],""count"":[11],""followers"":[13,37,63],""leads"":[14],""to"":[15,22,96],""higher"":[16],""profits,"":[17],""users"":[18],""have"":[19,64],""the"":[20,29,43,55,61,89,102],""incentive"":[21],""boost"":[23],""their"":[24,82],""in-degree."":[25],""Can"":[26],""we"":[27,46,106],""spot"":[28],""suspicious"":[30,39,56,103],""following"":[31,67],""behavior,"":[32],""which"":[33,49],""may"":[34],""indicate"":[35],""zombie"":[36,62],""and"":[38,78,100],""followees?"":[40],""To"":[41],""answer"":[42],""above"":[44],""question,"":[45],""propose"":[47],""CatchSync,"":[48],""exploits"":[50],""two"":[51],""tell-tale"":[52],""signs"":[53],""behavior:"":[57,60,81],""(a)"":[58],""synchronized"":[59],""extremely"":[65],""similar"":[66],""behavior"":[68,83],""pattern,"":[69],""because,"":[70],""say,"":[71],""they"":[72],""are"":[73],""generated"":[74],""by"":[75],""script;"":[77],""(b)"":[79],""abnormal"":[80],""pattern"":[84],""is"":[85,109],""very"":[86],""different"":[87],""from"":[88],""majority."":[90],""Our"":[91],""CatchSync"":[92],""introduces"":[93],""novel"":[94],""measures"":[95],""quantify"":[97],""both"":[98],""concepts"":[99],""catches"":[101],""behavior."":[104],""Moreover,"":[105],""show"":[107],""it"":[108],""effective"":[110],""in"":[111],""real-world"":[113],""social"":[114],""network."":[115]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2567948.2577306""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/www2014c.html#JiangCBFY14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2567948.2577306""}],""VFN"":""International World Wide Web Conferences"",""VSN"":""WWW"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2567948.2577306"",""RP"":[{""Id"":146417747,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2005556331,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2098395374,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2133591726,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Meng"",""LN"":""Jiang"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Peng"",""LN"":""Cui"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Alex"",""LN"":""Beutel"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""Shiqiang"",""LN"":""Yang"",""S"":5}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web"",""BT"":""p""}",13,"[{u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}]",2118422001,,en,3,"[2101196063, 2138621811, 1981202432, 1996802155, 2135957668, 2098395374, 146417747, 1560607100, 2111639622]",detecting suspicious following behavior in multimillion node social networks,0,"[u'behavior', u'detecting', u'following', u'multimillion', u'networks', u'node', u'social', u'suspicious']",2014,"In a multimillion-node network of who-follows-whom like Twitter, since a high count of followers leads to higher profits, users have the incentive to boost their in-degree.

To answer the above question, we propose CatchSync, which exploits two tell-tale signs of the suspicious behavior: (a) synchronized behavior: the zombie followers have extremely similar following behavior pattern, because, say, they are generated by a script; and (b) abnormal behavior: their behavior pattern is very different from the majority. Our CatchSync introduces novel measures to quantify both concepts and catches the suspicious behavior.

We apply our method to real datasets, including a phone call network, a computer-traffic network and a flight information network. The phone call network consists of 4 million mobile users, with 51 million edges (phone calls), over 14 days, while the flights dataset consists of 7733 airports and 5995 airline companies flying 67,663 different routes. We show that Com $$^2$$2 spots intuitive patterns regarding edge labels that carry temporal or other discrete information.

rules? Are these keywords related? If so, are they competing against each other? Can we forecast the volume of user activity for the coming month? We conjecture that online activities compete for user attention in the same way that species in an ecosystem compete for food. We present EcoWeb, (i.e., Ecosystem on the Web), which is an intuitive model designed as a non-linear dynamical system for mining large-scale co-evolving online activities. Our second contribution is a novel, parameter-free, and scalable fitting algorithm, EcoWeb-Fit, that estimates the parameters of EcoWeb. Extensive experiments on real data show that EcoWeb is effective, in that it can capture long-range dynamics and meaningful patterns such as seasonalities, and practical, in that it can provide accurate long-range forecasts. EcoWeb consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed.",1059,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2341078199,msa_2341078199,-20.201,msa,msa_2341078199,01484,"[{u'AuId': 2191206652, u'AfN': u'university of maryland college park', u'DAfN': u'University of Maryland, College Park', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'srijan kumar', u'AfId': 66946132, u'DAuN': u'Srijan Kumar'}, {u'AuId': 2203751546, u'AfN': u'boise state university', u'DAfN': u'Boise State University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'francesca spezzano', u'AfId': 120156002, u'DAuN': u'Francesca Spezzano'}, {u'AuId': 2261167843, u'AfN': u'university of maryland college park', u'DAfN': u'University of Maryland, College Park', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'v s subrahmanian', u'AfId': 66946132, u'DAuN': u'V.

WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks. We propose two novel measures of node behavior: the goodness of a node intuitively captures how much this node is liked/trusted by other nodes, while the fairness of a node captures how fair the node is in rating other nodes' likeability or trust level. We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs. We provide a mutually recursive definition of these two concepts and prove that they converge to a unique solution in linear time. We use the two measures to predict the edge weight in WSNs. Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work.

In this paper, we aim to utilize exactly this information to discern suspicious from typical behavior in an unsupervised fashion, lending well to the traditional scarcity of ground-truth labels in practical anomaly detection scenarios. Our work has a number of notable contributions, including (a) formulation: while most other graph-based anomaly detection works use structural graph connectivity or node information, we focus on the new problem of leveraging edge information, (b) methodology: we introduce EdgeCentric, an intuitive and scalable compression-based approach for detecting edge-attributed graph anomalies, and (c) practicality: we show that EdgeCentric successfully spots numerous such anomalies in several large, edge-attributed real-world graphs, including the Flipkart e-commerce graph with over 3 million product reviews between 1.1 million users and 545 thousand products, where it achieved 0.87 precision over the top 100 results.",1140,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2134679251,msa_2134679251,-20.299,msa,msa_2134679251,01495,"[{u'AuId': 1755863881, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'bryan hooi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Bryan Hooi'}, {u'AuId': 2158947101, u'AfN': u'kaist', u'DAfN': u'KAIST', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'hyun ah song', u'AfId': 157485424, u'DAuN': u'Hyun Ah Song'}, {u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

A related, harder problem is: how can we assign a numerical score to each lesson plan (i.e. way of conveying information)?

Existing (G)CCA algorithms have serious scalability issues, since they involve square root factorization of the correlation matrices of the views. The memory and computational complexity associated with this step grow as a quadratic and cubic function of the problem dimension (the number of samples / features), respectively. To circumvent such difficulties, we propose a GCCA algorithm whose memory and computational costs scale linearly in the problem dimension and the number of nonzero data elements, respectively. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can easily handle very large sparse views whose sample and feature dimensions both exceed 100,000 – while the current approaches can only handle thousands of features / samples. Our second contribution is a distributed algorithm for GCCA, which computes the canonical components of different views in parallel and thus can further reduce the runtime significantly (by ≥ 30% in experiments) if multiple cores are available. Judiciously designed synthetic and real-data experiments using a multilingual dataset are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",1378,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2583191533,msa_2583191533,-20.314,msa,msa_2583191533,01551,"[{u'AuId': 2124002246, u'AfN': u'virginia tech', u'DAfN': u'Virginia Tech', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'b aditya prakash', u'AfId': 859038795, u'DAuN': u'B.

In other words, can we reliably tell who the culprits are? In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively and give an efficient method called NetSleuth for the well-known susceptible-infected virus propagation model. Essentially, we are after that set of seed nodes that best explain the given snapshot. We propose to employ the minimum description length principle to identify the best set of seed nodes and virus propagation ripple, as the one by which we can most succinctly describe the infected graph. We give an highly efficient algorithm to identify likely sets of seed nodes given a snapshot. Then, given these seed nodes, we show we can optimize the virus propagation ripple in a principled way by maximizing likelihood. With all three combined, NetSleuth can automatically identify the correct number of seed nodes, as well as which nodes are the culprits.

How can we optimize the underlying graph structure to affect the outcome of such dissemination processes in a desired way (e.g., stop a virus propagation, facilitate the propagation of a piece of good idea, etc)? Existing research suggests that the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph is the key metric in determining the so-called epidemic threshold for a variety of dissemination models. In this paper, we study the problem of how to optimally place a set of edges (e.g., edge deletion and edge addition) to optimize the leading eigenvalue of the underlying graph, so that we can guide the dissemination process in a desired way. We propose effective, scalable algorithms for edge deletion and edge addition, respectively. In addition, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between edge deletion and node deletion problems.

Broadly speaking, the property of robustness is crucial in real graphs, since it is related to the structural behavior of graphs to retain their connectivity properties after losing a portion of their edges/nodes. Can we estimate a robustness index for a graph quickly? Additionally, if the graph evolves over time, how this property changes? In this work, we are trying to answer the above questions studying the expansion properties of large social graphs. First, we present a measure that characterizes the robustness properties of a graph and also serves as global measure of the community structure (or lack thereof). We show how to compute this measure efficiently by exploiting the special spectral properties of real-world networks. We apply our method on several diverse real networks with millions of nodes, and we observe interesting properties for both static and time-evolving social graphs. As an application example, we show how to spot outliers and anomalies in graphs over time. Finally, we examine how graph generating models that mimic several properties of real-world graphs and behave in terms of robustness dynamics.",1204,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2054421005,msa_2054421005,-20.116,msa,msa_2054421005,01815,"[{u'AuId': 2106416586, u'AfN': u'kumamoto university', u'DAfN': u'Kumamoto University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yasuko matsubara', u'AfId': 96036126, u'DAuN': u'Yasuko Matsubara'}, {u'AuId': 2608982952, u'AfN': u'university of california berkeley', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Berkeley', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'lei li', u'AfId': 95457486, u'DAuN': u'Lei Li'}, {u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

How can we summarize the major trends, and how can we spot anomalies? The anal- ysis of trajectories has been an issue of considerable interest with many applications such as tracking trails of migrating animals and predicting the path of hurricanes. Several recent works propose methods on clus- tering and indexing trajectories data. However, these approaches are not especially well suited to pattern discovery with respect to the dynamics of social and economic behavior. To further analyze a huge collection of taxi trajectories, we develop a novel method, called F-Trail ,w hich al- lows us to find meaningful patterns and anomalies. Our approach has the following advantages: (a) it is fast, and scales linearly on the input size, (b) it is effective, leading to novel discoveries, and surprising outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, by performing exper- iments on real taxi trajectories. In fact, F-Trail does produce concise, informative and interesting patterns.",1111,christos faloutsos,computer science

Facebook wall? At a high level, this question captures the essence of our work. While most prior efforts focus on Twitter, the much fewer Facebook studies focus on the friendship graph or are limited by the amount of users or the duration of the study. In this work, we model Facebook user behavior: we analyze the wall activities of users focusing on identifying common patterns and surprising phenomena. We conduct an extensive study of roughly 7k users over 3 years during 4-month intervals each year. We propose PowerWall, a lesser known heavy-tailed distribution to fit our data. Our key results can be summarized in the following points. First, we find that many wall activities, including number of posts, number of likes, number of posts of type photo, can be described by the PowerWall distribution. What is more surprising is that most of these distributions have similar slope, with a value close to 1! Second, we show how our patterns and metrics can help us spot surprising behaviors and anomalies. For example, we find a user posting every two days, exactly the same count of posts; another user posting at midnight, with no other activity before or after. Our work provides a solid step toward a systematic and quantitative wall-centric profiling of Facebook user activity.",1322,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2588526961,msa_2588526961,-20.222,msa,msa_2588526961,01844,"[{u'AuId': 2169155435, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jay yoon lee', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jay Yoon Lee'}, {u'AuId': 2426051778, u'AfN': u'kaist', u'DAfN': u'KAIST', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'u kang', u'AfId': 157485424, u'DAuN': u'U.

Determining the quality of a given tensor decomposition is a task of utmost importance that spans all fields of application of tensors. This task by itself is hard in its nature, since even determining the rank of a tensor is an NP-hard problem. Fortunately, there exist heuristics in the literature that can be effectively used for this task; one of these heuristics is the so-called Core Consistency Diagnostic (CORCONDIA) which is very intuitive and simple. However simple, computation of this diagnostic proves to be a very daunting task even for data of medium scale, let alone big tensor data. With the increase of the size of the tensor data that need to be analyzed there grows the need for efficient and scalable algorithms to compute diagnostics such as CORCONDIA, in order to assess the modelling quality. In this work we derive a fast and exact algorithm for CORCONDIA which exploits data sparsity and scales very well as the tensor size increases.",1111,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1526991336,msa_1526991336,-19.792,msa,msa_1526991336,01861,"[{u'AuId': 2169155435, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jay yoon lee', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jay Yoon Lee'}, {u'AuId': 2426051778, u'AfN': u'kaist', u'DAfN': u'KAIST', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'u kang', u'AfId': 157485424, u'DAuN': u'U.

We propose to extract concepts that describe groups of objects and their common properties from the integrated data. The discovered concepts provide semantic information as well as an abstract view on the integrated data and thus improve the understanding of complex systems. Our proposed method has the following desirable properties: (a) it is parameter-free and therefore requires no user-defined parameters (b) it is fault-tolerant, allowing for the detection of missing links and (c) it is scalable, being linear on the input size.

Existing fraud detection methods (spectral, etc.) try to identify dense subgraphs of nodes that are sparsely connected to the remaining graph. Fraudsters can evade these methods using camouflage, by adding reviews or follows with honest targets so that they look ""normal"". Even worse, some fraudsters use hijacked accounts from honest users, and then the camouflage is indeed organic. Our focus is to spot fraudsters in the presence of camouflage or hijacked accounts. We propose FRAUDAR, an algorithm that (a) is camouflage-resistant, (b) provides upper bounds on the effectiveness of fraudsters, and (c) is effective in real-world data. Experimental results under various attacks show that FRAUDAR outperforms the top competitor in accuracy of detecting both camouflaged and non-camouflaged fraud. Additionally, in real-world experiments with a Twitter follower-followee graph of 1.47 billion edges, FRAUDAR successfully detected a subgraph of more than 4000 detected accounts, of which a majority

epidemiological data consisting of the count of d contagious diseases for l locations of duration n, how can we find patterns, rules and outliers? For example, the Project Tycho provides open access to the count infections for U.S. states from 1888 to 2013, for 56 contagious diseases (e.g., measles, influenza), which include missing values, possible recording errors, sudden spikes (or dives) of infections, etc. So how can we find a combined model, for all these diseases, locations, and time-ticks? In this paper, we present FUNNEL, a unifying analytical model for large scale epidemiological data, as well as a novel fitting algorithm, FUNNELFIT, which solves the above problem. Our method has the following properties: (a) Sense-making: it detects important patterns of epidemics, such as periodicities, the appearance of vaccines, external shock events, and more; (b) Parameter-free: our modeling framework frees the user from providing parameter values; (c) Scalable: FUNNELFIT is carefully designed to be linear on the input size; (d) General: our model is general and practical, which can be applied to various types of epidemics, including computer-virus propagation, as well as human diseases. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that FUNNELFIT does indeed discover important properties of epidemics: (P1) disease seasonality, e.g., influenza spikes in January, Lyme disease spikes in July and the absence of yearly periodicity for gonorrhea; (P2) disease reduction effect, e.g., the appearance of vaccines; (P3) local/state-level sensitivity, e.g., many measles cases in NY; (P4) external shock events, e.g., historical flu pandemics; (P5) detect incongruous values, i.e., data reporting errors.",1747,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1985164990,msa_1985164990,-19.484,msa,msa_1985164990,02050,"[{u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

More specifically, given the stimulus, what are the interactions between (groups of) neurons (also known as functional connectivity) and how can we automatically infer those interactions, given measurements of the brain activity? Furthermore, how does this connectivity differ across different human subjects?   In this work we present a simple, novel good-enough brain model, or GeBM in short, and a novel algorithm Sparse-SysId, which are able to effectively model the dynamics of the neuron interactions and infer the functional connectivity. Moreover, GeBM is able to simulate basic psychological phenomena such as habituation and priming (whose definition we provide in the main text).   We evaluate GeBM by using both synthetic and real brain data. Using the real data, GeBM produces brain activity patterns that are strikingly similar to the real ones, and the inferred functional connectivity is able to provide neuroscientific insights towards a better understanding of the way that neurons interact with each other, as well as detect regularities and outliers in multi-subject brain activity measurements.",1242,christos faloutsos,computer

users and the products that they review, or followers and followees, how can we detect fake reviews or follows? Existing fraud detection methods (spectral, etc.) try to identify dense subgraphs of nodes that are sparsely connected to the remaining graph. Fraudsters can evade these methods using  camouflage , by adding reviews or follows with honest targets so that they look “normal.” Even worse, some fraudsters use  hijacked accounts  from honest users, and then the camouflage is indeed organic.   Our focus is to spot fraudsters in the presence of camouflage or hijacked accounts. We propose FRAUDAR, an algorithm that (a) is camouflage resistant, (b) provides upper bounds on the effectiveness of fraudsters, and (c) is effective in real-world data. Experimental results under various attacks show that FRAUDAR outperforms the top competitor in accuracy of detecting both camouflaged and non-camouflaged fraud. Additionally, in real-world experiments with a Twitter follower--followee graph of 1.47 billion edges, FRAUDAR successfully detected a subgraph of more than 4, 000 detected accounts, of which a majority had tweets showing that they used follower-buying services.",1207,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2730363704,msa_2730363704,-20.379,msa,msa_2730363704,02086,"[{u'AuId': 2621934521, u'S': 1, u'DAuN': u'Zongge Liu', u'AuN': u'zongge liu'}, {u'AuId': 2158947101, u'AfN': u'kaist', u'DAfN': u'KAIST', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'hyun ah song', u'AfId': 157485424, u'DAuN': u'Hyun Ah Song'}, {u'AuId': 179379646, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'vladimir zadorozhny', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Vladimir Zadorozhny'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2268379917, u'AfN': u'university of minnesota', u'DAfN': u'University of Minnesota', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'nicholas d sidiropoulos', u'AfId': 130238516, u'DAuN': u'Nicholas D.

For example, given a mixture of the monthly and weekly sums, how can we find the daily counts of people infected with flu? In general, what is the best way to recover historical counts from aggregated, possibly overlapping historical reports, in the presence of missing values? Equally importantly, how much should we trust this reconstruction? We propose H-FUSE, a novel method that solves above problems by allowing injection of domain knowl- edge in a principled way, and turning the task into a well- defined optimization problem. H-FUSE has the following desirable properties: (a) Effectiveness, recovering histori- cal data from aggregated reports with high accuracy; (b) Self-awareness, providing an assessment of when the re- covery is not reliable; (c) Scalability, computationally lin- ear on the size of the input data. Experiments on the real data (epidemiology counts from the Tycho project [13]) demonstrates that H-FUSE reconstructs the original data 30 − 81% better than the least squares method.",1125,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2623244766,msa_2623244766,-20.335,msa,msa_2623244766,02087,"[{u'AuId': 2165171050, u'AfN': u'university of sao paulo', u'DAfN': u'University of S\xe3o Paulo', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'robson l f cordeiro', u'AfId': 17974374, u'DAuN': u'Robson Leonardo Ferreira Cordeiro'}, {u'AuId': 2017812127, u'AfN': u'university of sao paulo', u'DAfN': u'University of S\xe3o Paulo', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'agma j m traina', u'AfId': 17974374, u'DAuN': u'Agma J.

Existing methods are typically superlinear in space or execution time. Halite's strengths are that it is fast and scalable, while still giving highly accurate results. Specifically the main contributions of Halite are: 1) Scalability: it is linear or quasi linear in time and space regarding the data size and dimensionality, and the dimensionality of the clusters' subspaces; 2) Usability: it is deterministic, robust to noise, doesn't take the number of clusters as an input parameter, and detects clusters in subspaces generated by original axes or by their linear combinations, including space rotation; 3) Effectiveness: it is accurate, providing results with equal or better quality compared to top related works; and 4) Generality: it includes a soft clustering approach. Experiments on synthetic data ranging from five to 30 axes and up to 1 \rm million points were performed. Halite was in average at least 12 times faster than seven representative works, and always presented highly accurate results.

For example, network intrusion logs, with (source-ip, target-ip, port-number, timestamp)? Tensors are suitable for modeling these multi-dimensional data, and widely used for the analysis of social networks, web data, network traffic, and in many other settings. However, current tensor decomposition methods do not scale for tensors with millions and billions of rows, columns and ‘fibers’, that often appear in real datasets. In this paper, we propose HaTen2, a scalable distributed suite of tensor decomposition algorithms running on the MapReduce platform. By carefully reordering the operations, and exploiting the sparsity of real world tensors, HaTen2 dramatically reduces the intermediate data, and the number of jobs. As a result, using HaTen2, we analyze big real-world tensors that can not be handled by the current state of the art, and discover hidden concepts.",976,christos faloutsos,computer science

Reducing the risks associated with an AHE requires effective and efficient mining of data generated from multiple physiological time series.

HeartCast combines a non-linear support vector machine with best-feature extraction via analysis of the baseline threshold, quartile parameters, and window size of the physiological signals. Our approach has the following benefits: (a) it extracts the most relevant features; (b) it provides the best results for identification of an AHE event; (c) it is fast and scales with linear complexity over the length of the window; and (d) it can manage missing values and noise/outliers by using a best-feature extraction method.

Are there nodes that participate in too many or too few triangles? Are there close-knit near-cliques? These questions are expensive to answer unless we have the first several eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrix. However, eigensolvers suffer from subtle problems (e.g., convergence) for large sparse matrices, let alone for billion-scale ones. We address this problem with the proposed HEIGEN algorithm, which we carefully design to be accurate, efficient, and able to run on the highly scalable MAPREDUCE (HADOOP) environment. This enables HEIGEN to handle matrices more than 1;000 × larger than those which can be analyzed by existing algorithms. We implement HEIGEN and run it on the M45 cluster, one of the top 50 supercomputers in the world. We report important discoveries about nearcliques and triangles on several real-world graphs, including a snapshot of the Twitter social network (56 Gb, 2 billion edges) and the “YahooWeb” data set, one of the largest publicly available graphs (120 Gb, 1.4 billion nodes, 6.6 billion edges).",1148,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2129898896,msa_2129898896,-19.341,msa,msa_2129898896,02153,"[{u'AuId': 2613422379, u'S': 1, u'DAuN': u'Shenghua Liu', u'AuN': u'shenghua liu'}, {u'AuId': 1755863881, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'bryan hooi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Bryan Hooi'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]",,0,,2017-05-06,"{""DN"":""HoloScope: Topology-and-Spike Aware Fraud Detection"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":196,""InvertedIndex"":{""As"":[0],""online"":[1],""fraudsters"":[2,135,157],""invest"":[3],""more"":[4,41,69,93,158],""resources,"":[5],""including"":[6,40],""purchasing"":[7],""large"":[8],""pools"":[9],""of"":[10,39,73,78,103,115,144,150],""fake"":[11],""user"":[12],""accounts"":[13],""and"":[14,22,49,65,113,166,174,187],""dedicated"":[15],""IPs,"":[16],""fraudulent"":[17,74,96],""attacks"":[18],""become"":[19],""less"":[20],""obvious"":[21],""their"":[23],""detection"":[24,194],""becomes"":[25],""increasingly"":[26],""challenging."":[27],""Existing"":[28],""approaches"":[29],""such"":[30],""as"":[31],""average"":[32],""degree"":[33],""maximization"":[34],""suffer"":[35],""from"":[36,62,141],""the"":[37,110,130,142,148,171],""bias"":[38],""nodes"":[42],""than"":[43],""necessary,"":[44],""resulting"":[45],""in"":[46,153],""lower"":[47],""accuracy"":[48,183],""increased"":[50],""need"":[51],""for"":[52,125,134],""manual"":[53],""verification."":[54],""Hence,"":[55],""we"":[56,81,121],""propose"":[57],""HoloScope,"":[58],""which"":[59,89],""uses"":[60],""information"":[61],""graph"":[63,79],""topology"":[64],""temporal"":[66,104],""spikes"":[67],""to"":[68,92,136,155],""accurately"":[70,94],""detect"":[71,95],""groups"":[72],""users."":[75],""In"":[76,101,119],""terms"":[77,102],""topology,"":[80],""introduce"":[82],""\""contrast"":[83],""suspiciousness,\"""":[84],""a"":[85,163],""dynamic"":[86],""weighting"":[87],""approach,"":[88],""allows"":[90],""us"":[91],""blocks,"":[97],""particularly"":[98],""low-density"":[99],""blocks."":[100],""spikes,"":[105],""HoloScope"":[106,146,161,180],""takes"":[107],""into"":[108],""account"":[109],""sudden"":[111],""bursts"":[112],""drops"":[114],""fraudsters'"":[116],""attacking"":[117],""patterns."":[118],""addition,"":[120],""provide"":[122],""theoretical"":[123],""bounds"":[124],""how"":[126],""much"":[127],""this"":[128],""increases"":[129],""time"":[131,168],""cost"":[132],""needed"":[133],""conduct"":[137],""adversarial"":[138],""attacks."":[139],""Additionally,"":[140],""perspective"":[143],""ratings,"":[145],""incorporates"":[147],""deviation"":[149],""rating"":[151],""scores"":[152],""order"":[154],""catch"":[156],""accurately."":[159],""Moreover,"":[160],""has"":[162],""concise"":[164],""framework"":[165],""sub-quadratic"":[167],""complexity,"":[169],""making"":[170],""algorithm"":[172],""reproducible"":[173],""scalable."":[175],""Extensive"":[176],""experiments"":[177],""showed"":[178],""that"":[179],""achieved"":[181],""significant"":[182],""improvements"":[184],""on"":[185],""synthetic"":[186],""real"":[188],""data,"":[189],""compared"":[190],""with"":[191],""state-of-the-art"":[192],""fraud"":[193],""methods."":[195]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1705.html#LiuHF17""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02505""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://128.84.21.199/abs/1705.02505""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1705.02505""}],""VFN"":""arXiv: Social and Information Networks"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Shenghua"",""LN"":""Liu"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Bryan"",""LN"":""Hooi"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.02505"",""BT"":""a""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'world wide web', u'FId': 136764020}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2613993493,"{u'JN': u'arxiv cs si', u'JId': 2595804992}",en,0,,holoscope topology and spike aware fraud detection,0,"[u'aware', u'detection', u'fraud', u'holoscope', u'spike', u'topology']",2017,"As online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, fraudulent attacks become less obvious and their detection becomes increasingly challenging. Existing approaches such as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which uses information from graph topology and temporal spikes to more accurately detect groups of fraudulent users. In terms of graph topology, we introduce ""contrast suspiciousness,"" a dynamic weighting approach, which allows us to more accurately detect fraudulent blocks, particularly low-density blocks. In terms of temporal spikes, HoloScope takes into account the sudden bursts and drops of fraudsters' attacking patterns. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Additionally, from the perspective of ratings, HoloScope incorporates the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately. Moreover, HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, making the algorithm reproducible and scalable. Extensive experiments showed that HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on synthetic and real data, compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.",1442,christos

At a high level, this question captures the essence of our work. While most prior efforts focus on Twitter, the much fewer Facebook studies focus on the friendship graph or are limited by the amount of users or the duration of the study. In this work, we model Facebook user behavior: we analyze the wall activities of users focusing on identifying common patterns and surprising phenomena. We conduct an extensive study of roughly 7K users over three years during four month intervals each year. We propose PowerWall, a lesser known heavy-tailed distribution to fit our data. Our key results can be summarized in the following points. First, we find that many wall activities, including number of posts, number of likes, number of posts of type photo, etc., can be described by the PowerWall distribution. What is more surprising is that most of these distributions have similar slope, with a value close to 1! Second, we show how our patterns and metrics can help us spot surprising behaviors and anomalies. For example, we find a user posting every two days, exactly the same count of posts; another user posting at midnight, with no other activity before or after. Our work provides a solid step towards a systematic and quantitative wall-centric profiling of Facebook user activity.",1336,christos faloutsos,computer science

Yet there has been relatively little work in modeling the behaviors and temporal properties of websites, as most research focuses on detecting whether a website distributes malware. In this paper we ask: How does web-based malware spread? We conduct an extensive study and follow a website-centric and user-centric point of view. We collect data from four online databases, including Symantec's WINE Project, for a total of more than 600K malicious URLs and over 500K users. First, we find that legitimate but compromised websites constitute 33.1% of the malicious websites in our dataset. In order to conduct this study, we develop a classifier to distinguish between compromised vs. malicious websites with an accuracy of 95.3%, which could be of interest to studies on website profiling. Second, we find that malicious URLs can be surprisingly long-lived, with 10% of malicious sites staying active for three months or more. Third, we observe that a significant number of URLs exhibit the same temporal pattern that suggests a flush-crowd behavior, inflicting most of their damage during the first few days of appearance. Finally, the distribution of the visits to malicious sites per user is skewed, with 1.4% of users visiting more than 10 malicious sites in 8 months. Our study is a first step towards modeling web-based malware propagation as a network-wide phenomenon and enabling researchers to develop realistic assumptions and models.",1578,christos

When companies operate on the graphs with monetary incentives to sell Twitter ""Followers"" and Facebook page ""Likes"", the graphs show strange connectivity patterns. In this paper, we study a complete graph from a large Twitter-style social network, spanning up to 3.33 billion edges. We report strange deviations from typical patterns like smooth degree distributions. We find that such deviations are often due to ""lockstep behavior"" that large groups of followers connect to the same groups of followees. Our first contribution is that we study strange patterns on the adjacency matrix and in the spectral subspaces with respect to several flavors of lockstep. We discover that (a) the lockstep behaviors on the graph shape dense ""block"" in its adjacency matrix and creates ""rays"" in spectral subspaces, and (b) partially overlapping of the behaviors shape ""staircase"" in its adjacency matrix and creates ""pearls"" in spectral subspaces. The second contribution is that we provide a fast algorithm, using the discovery as a guide for practitioners, to detect users who offer the lockstep behaviors in undirected/directed/bipartite graphs. We carry out extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, as well as public datasets from IMDb and US Patent.

behavior? In this paper we study a complete graph from a large who-follows-whom network and spot lockstep behavior that large groups of followers connect to the same groups of followees. Our first contribution is that we study strange patterns on the adjacency matrix and in the spectral subspaces with respect to several flavors of lockstep. We discover that (a) the lockstep behavior on the graph shapes dense ""block"" in its adjacency matrix and creates ""ray"" in spectral subspaces, and (b) partially overlapping of the behavior shapes ""staircase"" in the matrix and creates ""pearl"" in the subspaces. The second contribution is that we provide a fast algorithm, using the discovery as a guide for practi- tioners, to detect users who offer the lockstep behavior. We demonstrate that our approach is effective on both synthetic and real data.",981,christos faloutsos,computer science

Here we answer these questions using data from the Polly telephone-based application, a large influence network of 72,000 people, with about 173,000 in- teractions, spanning 500MB of log data and 200 GB of audio data. We report surprising patterns, the most striking of which are: (a) the FIZZLE pattern, i.e., excitement about Polly shows a power-law decay over time with ex- ponent of -1.2; (b) the RENDEZVOUS pattern, that obeys a power law (we explain RENDEZVOUS in the text); (c) the DISPERSION pattern, we find that the more a person uses Polly, the fewer friends he will use it with, but in a reciprocal fashion.

It is a substantial challenge to be able to observe and understand such diffusion processes, which may be modeled as networks that are both large and dynamic. A key tool in this regard is data summarization. However, few existing studies aim to summarize graphs/networks for dynamics. Dynamic networks raise new challenges not found in static settings, including time sensitivity and the needs for online interestingness evaluation and summary traceability, which render existing techniques inapplicable. We study the topic of dynamic network summarization: how to summarize dynamic networks with millions of nodes by only capturing the few most interesting nodes or edges over time, and we address the problem by finding interestingness-driven diffusion processes. Based on the concepts of diffusion radius and scope, we define interestingness measures for dynamic networks, and we propose OSNet, an online summarization framework for dynamic networks. We report on extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-life data. The study offers insight into the effectiveness and design properties of OSNet.",1241,christos faloutsos,computer science

of nodes are marked. What can we say about these marked nodes? Are they all close-by in the graph, or are they segregated into multiple groups? How can we automatically determine how many, if any groups they form as well as find simple paths that connect the nodes in each group? We formalize the problem in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle: a set of paths is simple when we need few bits to describe each path from one node to another. For example, we want to avoid high-degree nodes, unless we need to visit many of its spokes. As such, the best partitioning requires the least number of bits to describe the paths that visit all marked nodes. We show that our formulation for finding simple paths between groups of nodes has connections to well-known other problems in graph theory, and is NP-hard. We propose fast effective solutions, and introduce DOT2DOT, an efficient algorithm for partitioning marked nodes as well as finding simple paths between nodes within parts.

These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment, where human expertise can guide the process.

To cope with these problems, we propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visual design.

For the second, we show how to handle time-evolving graphs as tensors, how to handle large tensors in map-reduce environments, as well as some discoveries such settings. For the third, we show that for virus propagation, a single number is enough to characterize the connectivity of graph, and thus we show how to do efficient immunization for almost any type of virus (SIS - no immunity; SIR - lifetime immunity; etc) We conclude with some open research questions for graph mining.",1126,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2051540014,msa_2051540014,-20.48,msa,msa_2051540014,02487,"[{u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'asonam', u'CId': 1194409624}",0,"{u'CIId': 124855822, u'CIN': u'asonam 2013'}",2013-08-01,"{""DN"":""Large graph mining - Patterns, explanations, and cascade analysis"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":66,""InvertedIndex"":{""Summary"":[0],""form"":[1],""only"":[2],""given."":[3],""What"":[4],""do"":[5,10],""graphs"":[6],""look"":[7],""like?"":[8],""How"":[9,15],""they"":[11],""evolve"":[12],""over"":[13,19],""time?"":[14,20],""does"":[16],""influence/news/viruses"":[17],""propagate,"":[18],""We"":[21,38],""present"":[22],""a"":[23,58],""long"":[24],""list"":[25],""of"":[26,47],""static"":[27],""and"":[28,31,42,51,57,64],""temporal"":[29],""laws,"":[30],""some"":[32],""recent"":[33],""observations"":[34],""on"":[35,61],""real"":[36],""graphs."":[37],""show"":[39],""that"":[40],""fractals"":[41],""self-similarity"":[43],""can"":[44],""explain"":[45],""several"":[46],""the"":[48],""observed"":[49],""patterns,"":[50],""we"":[52],""conclude"":[53],""with"":[54],""cascade"":[55],""analysis"":[56],""surprising"":[59],""result"":[60],""virus"":[62],""propagation"":[63],""immunization."":[65]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6785674""}],""VFN"":""Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining"",""VSN"":""ASONAM"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ASONAM.2013.6785674"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":1}],""BV"":""2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013)"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'fractal', u'FId': 40636538}, {u'FN': u'graph theory', u'FId': 88230418}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'discrete mathematics', u'FId': 118615104}, {u'FN': u'combinatorics', u'FId': 114614502}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",1543266768,,en,3,,large graph mining patterns explanations and cascade analysis,0,"[u'cascade', u'explanations', u'graph', u'large', u'mining', u'patterns']",2013,"Summary form only given.

And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal, conservative or centrist users? Often, we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily (""birds of a feather flock together"") or heterophily (""opposites attract""). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP, however, is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops.This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP), a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and, thus, comes with exact convergence guarantees. It handles homophily, heterophily, and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings. Plus, it allows a compact implementation in SQL. The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP), a localized (or ""myopic"") version of LinBP that propagates information across every edge at most once and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors. In addition, SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks. Our runtime experiments show that LinBP and SBP are orders of magnitude faster than standard BP, while leading to almost identical node labels.",1522,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2162150749,msa_2162150749,-19.162,msa,msa_2162150749,02669,"[{u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

of online social network has gained popularity during the last few years, the so called Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs). In such networks, users voluntarily share their location with their friends via a “check-in”. In exchange they get recommendations tailored to their particular location as well as special deals that businesses offer when users check-in frequently. LBSNs started as specialized platforms such as Gowalla and Foursquare, however their immense popularity has led online social networking giants like Facebook to adopt this functionality. The spatial aspect of LBSNs directly ties the physical with the online world, creating a very rich ecosystem where users interact with their friends both online as well as declare their physical (co-)presence in various locations. Such a rich environment calls for novel analytic tools that can model the aforementioned types of interactions. In this work, we propose to model and analyze LBSNs using Tensors and Tensor Decompositions, powerful analytical tools that have enjoyed great growth and success in fields like Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Signal Processing alike. By doing so, we identify tightly knit, hidden communities of users and locations which they frequent. In addition to Tensor Decompositions, we use Signal Processing tools that have been previously used in Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimations, in order to study the temporal dynamics of hidden

What are the temporal patterns for an individual increasing its social connectivity? What are the basic mechanisms governing the formation of these temporal patterns? No matter cyber or physical social systems, their structure and dynamics are mainly driven by the connectivity dynamics of each individual. However, due to the lack of empirical data, little is known about the empirical dynamic patterns of social connectivity at microscopic level, let alone the regularities or models governing these microscopic dynamics.   We examine the detailed growth process of ""WeChat"", the largest online social network in China, with 300 million users and 4.75 billion links spanning two years. We uncover a wide range of long-term power law growth and short-term bursty growth for the social connectivity of different users. We propose three key ingredients, namely average-effect, multiscale-effect and correlation-effect, which govern the observed growth patterns at microscopic level. As a result, we propose the long short memory process incorporating these ingredients, demonstrating that it successfully reproduces the complex growth patterns observed in the empirical data. By analyzing modeling parameters, we discover statistical regularities underlying the empirical growth dynamics. Our model and discoveries provide a foundation for the microscopic mechanisms of network growth dynamics, potentially leading to implications for prediction, clustering and outlier detection on human dynamics.",1556,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2745013327,msa_2745013327,-20.215,msa,msa_2745013327,02693,"[{u'AuId': 2226806500, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'kijung shin', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kijung Shin'}, {u'AuId': 1755863881, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'bryan hooi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Bryan Hooi'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'pkdd', u'CId': 1141769385}",4,,2016-09-19,"{""DN"":""M-Zoom: Fast Dense-Block Detection in Tensors with Quality Guarantees"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":186,""InvertedIndex"":{""Given"":[0],""a"":[1,23,75,87,124,167],""large-scale"":[2],""and"":[3,108,141,157,162,176],""high-order"":[4],""tensor,"":[5],""how"":[6],""can"":[7],""we"":[8,15,72],""find"":[9,16],""dense"":[10,32,57,80],""blocks"":[11,33,58,81,132],""in"":[12,18,34,48,62,82,160],""it?"":[13],""Can"":[14],""them"":[17],""near-linear"":[19],""time"":[20],""but"":[21],""with"":[22,86,103,116,170],""quality"":[24],""guarantee?"":[25],""Extensive"":[26],""previous"":[27],""work"":[28],""has"":[29,94],""shown"":[30],""that"":[31],""tensors"":[35,107],""as"":[36,38,144,146],""well"":[37,145],""graphs"":[39],""indicate"":[40],""anomalous"":[41],""or"":[42,67],""fraudulent"":[43],""behavior"":[44,47],""e.g.,"":[45],""lockstep"":[46],""social"":[49],""networks."":[50],""However,"":[51],""available"":[52,183],""methods"":[53,115],""for"":[54,78],""detecting"":[55],""such"":[56],""are"":[59,182],""not"":[60],""satisfactory"":[61],""terms"":[63],""of"":[64,90,106,130],""speed,"":[65],""accuracy,"":[66],""flexibility."":[68],""In"":[69],""this"":[70,180],""work,"":[71],""propose"":[73],""M-Zoom,"":[74],""flexible"":[76],""framework"":[77],""finding"":[79],""tensors,"":[83],""which"":[84],""works"":[85],""broad"":[88],""class"":[89],""density"":[91,129,148],""measures."":[92,149],""M-Zoom"":[93,100,122,137,152],""the"":[95,127,131],""following"":[96],""properties:"":[97],""1"":[98],""Scalable:"":[99],""scales"":[101],""linearly"":[102],""all"":[104],""aspects"":[105],""is"":[109],""upi¾źto"":[110],""114$$\\times"":[111],""$$faster"":[112],""than"":[113],""state-of-the-art"":[114],""similar"":[117],""accuracy."":[118],""2"":[119],""Provably"":[120],""accurate:"":[121],""provides"":[123],""guarantee"":[125],""on"":[126],""lowest"":[128],""it"":[133],""finds."":[134],""3"":[135],""Flexible:"":[136],""supports"":[138],""multi-block"":[139],""detection"":[140],""size"":[142],""bounds"":[143],""diverse"":[147],""4"":[150],""Effective:"":[151],""successfully"":[153],""detected"":[154],""edit"":[155],""wars"":[156],""bot"":[158],""activities"":[159],""Wikipedia,"":[161],""spotted"":[163],""network"":[164],""attacks"":[165],""from"":[166],""TCP"":[168],""dump"":[169],""near-perfect"":[171],""accuracy"":[172],""AUCi¾ź=i¾ź0.98."":[173],""The"":[174],""data"":[175],""software"":[177],""related"":[178],""to"":[179],""paper"":[181],""at"":[184],""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kijungs/codes/mzoom/."":[185]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46128-1_17.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_17""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_17""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pkdd/pkdd2016-1.html#ShinHF16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_17""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3088582""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_17""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46128-1_17.pdf""}],""VFN"":""European Conference on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"",""VSN"":""PKDD"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-319-46128-1_17"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Kijung"",""LN"":""Shin"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Bryan"",""LN"":""Hooi"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""ECML PKDD 2016 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases -

However, available methods for detecting such dense blocks are not satisfactory in terms of speed, accuracy, or flexibility.

How to detect abnormal search behaviors, among Alice and other users? Is there any distinct pattern in Alice's (or other users') search behavior? We studied what is probably the largest, publicly available, query log that contains more than 30 million queries from 0.6 million users. In this paper, we present a novel, user-and group-level framework, M3A: Model, MetaModel and Anomaly detection. For each user, we discover and explain a surprising, bi-modal pattern of the inter-arrival time (IAT) of landed queries (queries with user click-through). Specifically, the model Camel-Log is proposed to describe such an IAT distribution; we then notice the correlations among its parameters at the group level. Thus, we further propose the metamodel Meta-Click, to capture and explain the two-dimensional, heavy-tail distribution of the parameters. Combining Camel-Log and Meta-Click, the proposed M3A has the following strong points: (1) the accurate modeling of marginal IAT distribution, (2) quantitative interpretations, and (3) anomaly detection.",1144,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2460919741,msa_2460919741,-20.453,msa,msa_2460919741,02735,"[{u'AuId': 2059206925, u'AfN': u'salk institute for biological studies', u'DAfN': u'Salk Institute for Biological Studies', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'saket navlakha', u'AfId': 1307098950, u'DAuN': u'Saket Navlakha'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 96358963, u'AfN': u'center for computational biology', u'DAfN': u'Center for Computational Biology', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'ziv barjoseph', u'AfId': 140471344, u'DAuN': u'Ziv Bar-Joseph'}]",,2,,2015-09-01,"{""DN"":""MassExodus: modeling evolving networks in harsh environments"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":117,""InvertedIndex"":{""Consider"":[0],""networks"":[1,102,112],""in"":[2,39],""harsh"":[3,42],""environments,"":[4],""where"":[5],""nodes"":[6],""may"":[7],""be"":[8],""lost"":[9],""due"":[10],""to"":[11,77,109],""failure,"":[12],""attack,"":[13],""or"":[14,87],""infection--how"":[15],""is"":[16],""the"":[17,28,48,97],""topology"":[18],""affected"":[19],""by"":[20],""such"":[21],""events?"":[22],""Can"":[23],""we"":[24,95],""mimic"":[25],""and"":[26,41,56,67,103],""measure"":[27,76],""effect?"":[29],""We"":[30,70],""propose"":[31,104],""a"":[32,73,105],""new"":[33,74,106],""generative"":[34],""model"":[35,45],""of"":[36,50,99],""network"":[37],""evolution"":[38],""dynamic"":[40],""environments."":[43,116],""Our"":[44],""can"":[46],""reproduce"":[47],""range"":[49],""topologies"":[51],""observed"":[52],""across"":[53],""known"":[54],""robust"":[55],""fragile"":[57],""biological"":[58],""networks,"":[59],""as"":[60,62],""well"":[61],""several"":[63,100],""additional"":[64],""transport,"":[65],""communication,"":[66],""social"":[68],""networks."":[69],""also"":[71],""develop"":[72],""optimization"":[75],""evaluate"":[78,96],""robustness"":[79,98],""based"":[80],""on"":[81],""preserving"":[82],""high"":[83],""connectivity"":[84],""following"":[85],""random"":[86],""adversarial"":[88],""bursty"":[89],""node"":[90],""loss."":[91],""Using"":[92],""this"":[93],""measure,"":[94],""real-world"":[101],""distributed"":[107],""algorithm"":[108],""construct"":[110],""secure"":[111],""operating"":[113],""within"":[114],""malicious"":[115]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10618-014-0399-1.pdf""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.snl.salk.edu/~navlakha/pubs/pkdd2015.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2817442""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/datamine/datamine29.html#NavlakhaFB15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1""}],""VFN"":""Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"",""V"":29,""I"":5,""FP"":1211,""LP"":1232,""DOI"":""10.1007/s10618-014-0399-1"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Saket"",""LN"":""Navlakha"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Ziv"",""LN"":""Bar-Joseph"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery"",""BT"":""a""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'distributed computing', u'FId': 120314980}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}]",1970906137,"{u'JN': u'datamine', u'JId': 121920818}",en,1,"[2008620264, 2103017472, 36489662, 2065769502, 2114581929, 1968164782, 19838944, 2142437744, 2111708605, 2003516452, 2083477206, 2175110005, 2134006599, 2037102228, 2296679604, 2129620481, 2151078464, 1993009001, 1983485726, 1968686485, 1557055049, 2170680261, 2076199148, 2098048378, 1903894141, 2045874447, 2027725119, 1644724366, 2022589976, 1989400610, 1562536132, 2099021783, 2146538795, 1807089695, 2112920805, 2084668512, 2152361742, 2131984349, 1914370899, 2107623255, 2129077768, 2140750082, 2088164510, 2164071427, 2026369636, 2081245596, 2033918735, 2171580484, 2406772186, 2120526231, 2106533374, 1908543963, 2023354494, 2159848460, 1583876435, 2040843639]",massexodus modeling evolving networks in harsh environments,0,"[u'environments', u'evolving', u'harsh', u'massexodus', u'modeling', u'networks']",2015,"Consider networks in harsh environments, where nodes may be lost due to failure, attack, or infection--how is the topology affected by such events?

Many real-world data (e.g., network traffic logs, web data, social networks, knowledge bases, and sensor streams) with multiple attributes are represented as multi-dimensional arrays, called tensors. For analyzing a tensor, tensor decompositions are widely used in many data mining applications: detecting malicious attackers in network traffic logs (with source IP, destination IP, port-number, timestamp), finding telemarketers in a phone call history (with sender, receiver, date), and identifying interesting concepts in a knowledge base (with subject, object, relation). However, current tensor decomposition methods do not scale to large and sparse real-world tensors with millions of rows and columns and `fibers.' In this paper, we propose HaTen2, a distributed method for large-scale tensor decompositions that runs on the MapReduce framework. Our careful design and implementation of HaTen2 dramatically reduce the size of intermediate data and the number of jobs leading to achieve high scalability compared with the state-of-the-art method.

We exploit the ideas of subspace clustering where the relevance of dimensions might be different for each cluster. Combining the relevance of the dimensions with the cluster membership degree of the objects, we propose a novel type of mixture model able to represent data containing mixed membership subspace clusters. For learning our model, we develop an efficient algorithm based on variational inference allowing easy parallelization. In our empirical study on synthetic and real data we show the strengths of our novel clustering technique.",917,christos faloutsos,computer science

However, due to this popularity, spam and the distribution of malicious content by computer-controlled users, known as bots, has become a widespread problem. At the same time, when users use social media, they generate valuable data that can be used to understand the patterns of human communication. In this article, we focus on the following important question: Can we identify and use patterns of human communication to decide whether a human or a bot controls a user? The first contribution of this article is showing that the distribution of inter-arrival times (IATs) between postings is characterized by following four patterns: (i) heavy-tails, (ii) periodic-spikes, (iii) correlation between consecutive values, and (iv) bimodallity. As our second contribution, we propose a mathematical model named Act-M (Activity Model). We show that Act-M can accurately fit the distribution of IATs from social media users. Finally, we use Act-M to develop a method that detects if users are bots based only on the timing of their postings. We validate Act-M using data from over 55 million postings from four social media services: Reddit, Twitter, Stack-Overflow, and Hacker-News. Our experiments show that Act-M provides a more accurate fit to the data than existing models for human dynamics. Additionally, when detecting bots, Act-M provided a precision higher than 93% and 77% with a sensitivity of 70% for the Twitter and Reddit datasets, respectively.",1534,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2734923642,msa_2734923642,-20.374,msa,msa_2734923642,02885,"[{u'AuId': 2249226172, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'bruno f ribeiro', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Bruno Ribeiro'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'wsdm', u'CId': 1120384002}",8,"{u'CIId': 587101974, u'CIN': u'wsdm 2015'}",2015-02-02,"{""DN"":""Modeling Website Popularity Competition in the Attention-Activity Marketplace"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":134,""InvertedIndex"":{""How"":[0],""does"":[1],""a"":[2,58],""new"":[3,59,66],""startup"":[4],""drive"":[5],""the"":[6,37,45,55,77,85,113,132],""popularity"":[7,46,60],""of"":[8,22,47,57,79,97,119],""competing"":[9],""websites"":[10],""into"":[11,68,131],""oblivion"":[12],""like"":[13],""Facebook"":[14,42,120],""famously"":[15],""did"":[16],""to"":[17,25,53],""MySpace?"":[18],""This"":[19],""question"":[20],""is"":[21,91],""great"":[23],""interest"":[24],""academics,"":[26],""technologists,"":[27],""and"":[28,51,104,121],""financial"":[29],""investors"":[30],""alike."":[31],""In"":[32],""this"":[33],""work"":[34],""we"":[35,82],""exploit"":[36],""singular"":[38],""way"":[39],""in"":[40],""which"":[41,81],""wiped"":[43],""out"":[44],""MySpace,"":[48],""Hi5,"":[49],""Friendster,"":[50],""Multiply"":[52],""guide"":[54],""design"":[56,90],""competition"":[61],""model."":[62],""Our"":[63,88],""model"":[64,89,108],""provides"":[65],""insights"":[67],""what"":[69],""Nobel"":[70],""Laure-"":[71],""ate"":[72],""Herbert"":[73],""A."":[74],""Simon"":[75],""called"":[76],""\""marketplace"":[78],""attention,\"""":[80],""recast"":[83],""as"":[84],""attention-activity"":[86],""marketplace."":[87],""further"":[92],""substantiated"":[93],""by"":[94],""user-level"":[95],""activity"":[96],""250,000"":[98],""MySpace"":[99],""users"":[100],""obtained"":[101],""between"":[102],""2004"":[103],""2009."":[105],""The"":[106],""resulting"":[107],""not"":[109],""only"":[110],""accurately"":[111],""fits"":[112],""observed"":[114],""Daily"":[115],""Active"":[116],""Users"":[117],""(DAU)"":[118],""its"":[122],""competitors"":[123],""but"":[124],""also"":[125],""predicts"":[126],""their"":[127],""fate"":[128],""four"":[129],""years"":[130],""future."":[133]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1403.html#RibeiroF14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0600""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2685312""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2684822.2685312""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://128.84.21.199/abs/1403.0600""}],""VFN"":""Web Search and Data Mining"",""VSN"":""WSDM"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2684822.2685312"",""CC"":{""1972178529"":[""rtia eect, a force that (at least initially) opposes concurrent adoptions.

In this article, we exploit the relations among different modalities in a multimedia database and present a framework for general multimodal data mining problem where image annotation and image retrieval are considered as the special cases. Specifically, the multimodal data mining problem can be formulated as a structured prediction problem where we learn the mapping from an input to the structured and interdependent output variables. In addition, in order to reduce the demanding computation, we propose a new max margin structure learning approach called Enhanced Max Margin Learning (EMML) framework, which is much more efficient with a much faster convergence rate than the existing max margin learning methods, as verified through empirical evaluations. Furthermore, we apply EMML framework to develop an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale. The EMML framework allows an efficient multimodal data mining query in a very large scale multimedia database, and excels many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all. The performance comparison with a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method is reported for the real-world image databases.",1498,christos faloutsos,computer science

We refer to the detection of such synchronized observations as the Syn- chonization Fraud problem, and we study a specific instance of it, Retweet Fraud Detection, manifested in Twitter. Here, we propose: (A) ND-Sync, an efficient method for detecting group fraud, and (B) a set of carefully designed features for characterizing retweet threads. ND-Sync is effec- tive in spotting retweet fraudsters, robust to different types of abnormal activity, and adaptable as it can easily incorporate additional features.

Analogously, are there a set of social theories which, when represented by a small number of descriptive, numerical features, effectively serve as a ""signature"" for the network? Having such signatures will enable a wealth of graph mining and social network analysis tasks, including clustering, outlier detection, visualization, etc. We propose a novel, effective, and scalable method, called NETSIMILE, for solving the above problem. Our approach has the following desirable properties: (a) It is supported by a set of social theories. (b) It gives similarity scores that are size-invariant. (c) It is scalable, being linear on the number of links for graph signature extraction. In extensive experiments on numerous synthetic and real networks from disparate domains, NETSIMILE outperforms baseline competitors. We also demonstrate how our approach enables several mining tasks such as clustering, visualization, discontinuity detection, network transfer learning, and re-identification across networks.",1150,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1980331354,msa_1980331354,-19.856,msa,msa_1980331354,03052,"[{u'AuId': 2234161630, u'AfN': u'rutgers university', u'DAfN': u'Rutgers University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'priya govindan', u'AfId': 102322142, u'DAuN': u'Priya Govindan'}, {u'AuId': 1846143951, u'AfN': u'syracuse university', u'DAfN': u'Syracuse University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'sucheta soundarajan', u'AfId': 70983195, u'DAuN': u'Sucheta Soundarajan'}, {u'AuId': 218538652, u'AfN': u'northeastern university', u'DAfN': u'Northeastern University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'tina eliassirad', u'AfId': 12912129, u'DAuN': u'Tina Eliassi-Rad'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'asonam', u'CId': 1194409624}",2,"{u'CIId': 2313558862, u'CIN': u'asonam 2016'}",2016-08-01,"{""DN"":""NimbleCore: A space-efficient external memory algorithm for estimating core numbers"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":178,""InvertedIndex"":{""We"":[0,97,135],""address"":[1],""the"":[2,28,33,65,80,92,95,120,129,133],""problem"":[3],""of"":[4,8,13,24,51,67,94,108,122],""estimating"":[5,168],""core"":[6,22,106,169],""numbers"":[7,37,107,170],""nodes"":[9,109,123],""by"":[10],""reading"":[11],""edges"":[12],""a"":[14,25,68],""large"":[15,152],""graph"":[16,42],""stored"":[17],""in"":[18,31,40,132],""external"":[19,72],""memory."":[20],""The"":[21],""number"":[23,121],""node"":[26,34],""is"":[27,119,128],""highest"":[29],""k-core"":[30],""which"":[32,104],""participates."":[35],""Core"":[36],""are"":[38],""useful"":[39],""many"":[41],""mining"":[43],""tasks,"":[44],""especially"":[45],""ones"":[46],""that"":[47,138,158],""involve"":[48],""finding"":[49],""communities"":[50],""nodes,"":[52],""influential"":[53],""spreaders"":[54],""and"":[55,124],""dense"":[56],""subgraphs."":[57],""Large"":[58],""graphs"":[59,144,153],""often"":[60],""do"":[61,75,88],""not"":[62,76,89],""fit"":[63],""on"":[64,79,150],""memory"":[66,73],""single"":[69],""machine."":[70],""Existing"":[71],""solutions"":[74,86],""give"":[77],""bounds"":[78],""required"":[81],""space."":[82],""In"":[83],""practice,"":[84],""existing"":[85],""also"":[87,136],""scale"":[90],""with"":[91,145,171],""size"":[93],""graph."":[96,134],""propose"":[98],""NimbleCore,"":[99],""an"":[100],""iterative"":[101],""external-memory"":[102],""algorithm,"":[103],""estimates"":[105],""using"":[110],""O(n"":[111],""log"":[112],""d"":[113,125],""max"":[114,126],"")"":[115],""space,"":[116],""where"":[117],""n"":[118],""maximum"":[130],""node-degree"":[131],""show"":[137],""NimbleCore"":[139,159],""requires"":[140],""O(n)"":[141],""space"":[142,161],""for"":[143],""power-law"":[146],""degree"":[147],""distributions."":[148],""Experiments"":[149],""forty-eight"":[151],""from"":[154],""various"":[155],""domains"":[156],""demonstrate"":[157],""gives"":[160],""savings"":[162],""up"":[163],""to"":[164],""60X,"":[165],""while"":[166],""accurately"":[167],""average"":[172],""relative"":[173],""error"":[174],""less"":[175],""than"":[176],""2.3%."":[177]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/asunam/asonam2016.html#GovindanSEF16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7752237/""}],""VFN"":""Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining"",""VSN"":""ASONAM"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752237"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Priya"",""LN"":""Govindan"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Sucheta"",""LN"":""Soundarajan"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Tina"",""LN"":""Eliassi-Rad"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)"",""BT"":""p""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'discrete mathematics', u'FId': 118615104}, {u'FN': u'combinatorics', u'FId': 114614502}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",2553055811,,en,3,"[2128438887, 1976969221, 2133131640, 2755088640, 131619556, 2142599626, 2147991930, 2086595847, 2152886806, 2148606255, 2071864549, 1971717360, 2134695286, 2094224753, 1587668035, 2072903423, 2065355661, 1889221628, 2291620117, 788200807]",nimblecore a space efficient external memory algorithm for estimating core numbers,0,"[u'algorithm', u'core', u'efficient', u'estimating', u'external', u'memory', u'nimblecore', u'numbers', u'space']",2016,"We address the problem of estimating core numbers of nodes by reading edges of a large graph stored in external memory. The core number of a node is the highest k-core in which the node participates. Core numbers are useful in many graph mining tasks, especially ones that involve finding communities of nodes, influential spreaders and dense subgraphs. Large graphs often do not fit on the memory of a single machine. Existing external memory solutions do not give bounds on the required space. In practice, existing solutions also do not scale with the size of the graph. We propose NimbleCore, an iterative external-memory algorithm, which estimates core numbers of nodes using O(n log d max ) space, where n is the number of nodes and d max  is the maximum node-degree in the graph. We also show that NimbleCore requires O(n) space for graphs with power-law degree distributions. Experiments on forty-eight large graphs from various domains demonstrate that NimbleCore gives space savings up to 60X, while accurately estimating core numbers with average relative error less than 2.3%.",1088,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2553055811,msa_2553055811,-20.272,msa,msa_2553055811,03055,"[{u'AuId': 2311808467, u'AfN': u'arizona state university', u'DAfN': u'Arizona State University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'chen chen', u'AfId': 55732556, u'DAuN': u'Chen Chen'}, {u'AuId': 2667261544, u'AfN': u'arizona state university', u'DAfN': u'Arizona State University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'hanghang tong', u'AfId': 55732556, u'DAuN': u'Hanghang Tong'}, {u'AuId': 2124002246, u'AfN': u'virginia tech', u'DAfN': u'Virginia Tech', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'b aditya prakash', u'AfId': 859038795, u'DAuN': u'B.

This problem, referred to as the node immunization problem, is the core building block in many high-impact applications, ranging from public health, cybersecurity to viral marketing. A central component in node immunization is to find the best   $k$       bridges of a given graph. In this setting, we typically want to determine the relative importance of a node (or a set of nodes) within the graph, for example, how valuable (as a bridge) a person or a group of persons is in a social network. First of all, we propose a novel ‘bridging’ score    $\Delta \lambda$      , inspired by immunology, and we show that its results agree with intuition for several realistic settings. Since the straightforward way to compute   $\Delta \lambda$       is computationally intractable, we then focus on the computational issues and propose a surprisingly efficient way (  $O(nk^2+m)$      ) to estimate it.

such as Google search queries, which consist of d keywords/activities for m locations of duration n, how can we analyze temporal patterns and relationships among all these activities and find location-specific trends? How do we go about capturing non-linear evolutions of local activities and forecasting future patterns? For example, assume that we have the online search volume for multiple keywords, e.g., ""Nokia/Nexus/Kindle"" or ""CNN/BBC"" for 236 countries/territories, from 2004 to 2015. Our goal is to analyze a large collection of multi-evolving activities, and specifically, to answer the following questions: (a) Is there any sign of interaction/competition between two different keywords? If so, who competes with whom? (b) In which country is the competition strong? (c) Are there any seasonal/annual activities? (d) How can we automatically detect important world-wide (or local) events? We present COMPCUBE, a unifying non-linear model, which provides a compact and powerful representation of co-evolving activities; and also a novel fitting algorithm, COMPCUBE-FIT, which is parameter-free and scalable. Our method captures the following important patterns: (B)asic trends, i.e., non-linear dynamics of co-evolving activities, signs of (C)ompetition and latent interaction, e.g., Nokia vs. Nexus, (S)easonality, e.g., a Christmas spike for iPod in the U.S. and Europe, and (D)eltas, e.g., unrepeated local events such as the U.S. election in 2008. Thanks to its concise but effective summarization, COMPCUBE can also forecast long-range future activities. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that COMPCUBE consistently outperforms the best state-of- the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed.",1795,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2340354238,msa_2340354238,-19.923,msa,msa_2340354238,03071,"[{u'AuId': 2106416586, u'AfN': u'kumamoto university', u'DAfN': u'Kumamoto University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yasuko matsubara', u'AfId': 96036126, u'DAuN': u'Yasuko Matsubara'}, {u'AuId': 1989929707, u'AfN': u'kumamoto university', u'DAfN': u'Kumamoto University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'yasushi sakurai', u'AfId': 96036126, u'DAuN': u'Yasushi Sakurai'}, {u'AuId': 2124002246, u'AfN': u'virginia tech', u'DAfN': u'Virginia Tech', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'b aditya prakash', u'AfId': 859038795, u'DAuN': u'B.

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this article, we propose S pike M, a concise yet flexible analytical model of the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion. Our model has the following advantages. First, unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off versus die-out conditions for S pike M and discuss the generality of our model by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology. Second, practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data. Third, parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters. Fourth, usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-time monitoring of information diffusion, namely S pike S tream , which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that S pike M accurately and succinctly describes all patterns of the rise and fall spikes in social networks.",1574,christos faloutsos,computer

what is a practitioner to do? Traditional classification can lead to poor generalization and high misclassification given few and possibly biased labels. We tackle this problem by analyzing fraudulent behavioral patterns, featurizing users to yield strong discriminative performance, and building algorithms to handle new and multimodal fraud types. First, we set up honeypots, or ""dummy"" social network accounts on which we solicit fake followers (after careful IRB approval). We report the signs of such behaviors, including oddities in local network connectivity, account attributes, and similarities and differences across fraud providers. We discover several types of fraud behaviors, with the possibility of even more. We discuss how to leverage these insights in practice, build strongly performing entropy-based features, and propose OEC (Open-ended Classification), an approach for ""future-proofing"" existing algorithms to account for the complexities of link fraud. Our contributions are (a) observations: we analyze our honeypot fraudster ecosystem and give insights regarding various fraud behaviors, (b) features: we engineer features which give exceptionally strong (>0.95 precision/recall) discriminative power on ground-truth data, and (c) algorithm: we motivate and discuss OEC, which reduces misclassification rate by >18% over baselines and routes practitioner attention to samples at high-risk of misclassification.",1488,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2606085668,msa_2606085668,-20.415,msa,msa_2606085668,03116,"[{u'AuId': 2150454284, u'AfN': u'university of tsukuba', u'DAfN': u'University of Tsukuba', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yuto yamaguchi', u'AfId': 146399215, u'DAuN': u'Yuto Yamaguchi'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2124997989, u'AfN': u'university of tsukuba', u'DAfN': u'University of Tsukuba', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'hiroyuki kitagawa', u'AfId': 146399215, u'DAuN': u'Hiroyuki Kitagawa'}]","{u'CN': u'aaai', u'CId': 1184914352}",0,"{u'CIId': 86878734, u'CIN': u'aaai 2015'}",2015-01-25,"{""DN"":""OMNI-prop: seamless node classification on arbitrary label correlation"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":141,""InvertedIndex"":{""If"":[0],""we"":[1,12,23],""know"":[2],""most"":[3,37],""of"":[4,17,35,74,101,109,131],""Smith's"":[5,18],""friends"":[6],""are"":[7],""from"":[8],""Boston,"":[9],""what"":[10],""can"":[11],""say"":[13],""about"":[14],""the"":[15,26,36,55,106,113,129,132,138],""rest"":[16],""friends?"":[19],""In"":[20],""this"":[21],""paper,"":[22],""focus"":[24],""on"":[25,30,65,85,122],""node"":[27],""classification"":[28],""problem"":[29],""networks,"":[31],""which"":[32,48],""is"":[33,49,79],""one"":[34,94],""important"":[38],""topics"":[39],""in"":[40],""AI"":[41],""and"":[42,60,72,81,118],""Web"":[43],""communities."":[44],""Our"":[45],""proposed"":[46,133],""algorithm"":[47,111],""referred"":[50],""to"":[51,83,112,119],""as"":[52],""OMNI-Prop"":[53,136],""has"":[54,92],""following"":[56],""properties:"":[57],""(a)"":[58],""seamless"":[59],""accurate;"":[61],""it"":[62,78,91],""works"":[63],""well"":[64],""any"":[66],""label"":[67],""correlations"":[68],""(i.e.,"":[69],""homophily,"":[70],""het-erophily,"":[71],""mixture"":[73],""them)"":[75],""(b)"":[76],""fast;"":[77],""efficient"":[80],""guaranteed"":[82],""converge"":[84],""arbitrary"":[86],""graphs"":[87],""(c)"":[88],""quasi-parameter"":[89],""free;"":[90],""just"":[93],""well-interpretable"":[95],""parameter"":[96],""with"":[97],""heuristic"":[98],""default"":[99],""value"":[100],""1."":[102],""We"":[103],""also"":[104],""prove"":[105],""theoretical"":[107],""connections"":[108],""our"":[110],""semi-supervised"":[114],""learning"":[115],""(SSL)"":[116],""algorithms"":[117],""random-walks."":[120],""Experiments"":[121],""four"":[123],""real,"":[124],""different"":[125],""network"":[126],""datasets"":[127],""demonstrate"":[128],""benefits"":[130],""algorithm,"":[134],""where"":[135],""outperforms"":[137],""top"":[139],""competitors."":[140]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/aaai2015.html#YamaguchiFK15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/view/9382""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2888151""}],""VFN"":""National Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""AAAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Yuto"",""LN"":""Yamaguchi"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Hiroyuki"",""LN"":""Kitagawa"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""AAAI'15 Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'world wide web', u'FId': 136764020}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",1828512457,,en,0,"[1854214752, 1976969221, 2154455818, 2139823104, 2148847267, 2069153192, 2152284345, 2155461593, 2136486572, 171648926, 2153959628, 2056021151, 2148123869, 2120797124, 2121250409, 50479354, 2166914830, 1573811011, 2070774497, 2181900708, 2156094048, 119705851, 1842616801, 1889628180, 2112670995, 2394559683]",omni prop seamless node classification on arbitrary label correlation,0,"[u'arbitrary', u'classification', u'correlation', u'label', u'node', u'omni', u'prop', u'seamless']",2015,"If we know most of Smith's friends are from Boston, what can we say about the rest of Smith's friends?

We propose a fast and effective framework, FRAUDEAGLE, for spotting fraudsters and fake reviews in online review datasets. Our method has several advantages: (1) it exploits the network effect among reviewers and products, unlike the vast majority of existing methods that focus on review text or behavioral analysis, (2) it consists of two complementary steps; scoring users and reviews for fraud detection, and grouping for visualization and sensemaking, (3) it operates in a completely unsupervised fashion requiring no labeled data, while still incorporating side information if available, and (4) it is scalable to large datasets as its run time grows linearly with network size.

Tensor decompositions have gained a steadily increasing popularity in data-mining applications; however, the current state-of-art decomposition algorithms operate on main memory and do not scale to truly large datasets. In this work, we propose P ar C ube , a new and highly parallelizable method for speeding up tensor decompositions that is well suited to produce sparse approximations. Experiments with even moderately large data indicate over 90p sparser outputs and 14 times faster execution, with approximation error close to the current state of the art irrespective of computation and memory requirements.

We introduce the crucial windows where the estimated parameters present patterns before seizure onset. The optimal parameters minimizes the error between the observed signal and the generated signal by the model. The proposed approach effectively discriminates between healthy signals and epileptic seizure signals. We evaluate the proposed method using an electroencephalogram dataset with normal and epileptic seizure sequences. The empirical results show that the patterns of parameters as a seizure approach and the method is efficient in analyzing nonlinear epilepsy electroencephalogram data.

What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we exploit them for applications? A k-core is the maximal subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from diverse domains. Our discoveries are: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated with degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists) obeys a 3-to-1 power-law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy–cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core–periphery and communities.

This tagging network is by nature different from the resource tagging networks (e.g., Flickr and Delicious) because users on this network can tag each other. We address the following research questions: (RQ1) What is the common patterns and the difference between the interactive tagging network and the resource tagging networks? (RQ2) Do users tag each other on the interactive tagging network? And if so, to what extent? (RQ3) What is the difference between the two types of relationships on Twitter: who-tags-whom and who-follows-whom?

propagate the trust and distrust? With the appearance of fraudsters in social network sites, the importance of trust prediction has increased. Most such methods use only explicit and implicit trust information (e.g., if Smith likes several of Johnson's reviews, then Smith implicitly trusts Johnson), but they do not consider distrust.   In this paper, we propose  PIN -TRUST, a novel method to handle all three types of interaction information:  explicit  trust,  implicit  trust, and explicit distrust. The novelties of our method are the following: (a) it is carefully designed, to take into account positive, implicit, and negative information, (b) it is  scalable  (i.e., linear on the input size), (c) most importantly, it is  effective  and accurate. Our extensive experiments with a real dataset,  Epinions.com  data, of 100K nodes and 1M edges, confirm that PIN-TRUST is scalable and outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy, achieving up to 50.4 percentage relative improvement.",1066,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2539413804,msa_2539413804,-20.258,msa,msa_2539413804,03332,"[{u'AuId': 1524801041, u'AfN': u'university of michigan', u'DAfN': u'University of Michigan', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'danai koutra', u'AfId': 27837315, u'DAuN': u'Danai Koutra'}, {u'AuId': 2552542215, u'AfN': u'university of michigan', u'DAfN': u'University of Michigan', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'abhilash dighe', u'AfId': 27837315, u'DAuN': u'Abhilash Dighe'}, {u'AuId': 2750997670, u'AfN': u'facebook', u'DAfN': u'Facebook', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'smriti bhagat', u'AfId': 2252078561, u'DAuN': u'Smriti Bhagat'}, {u'AuId': 2720178077, u'AfN': u'facebook', u'DAfN': u'Facebook', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'udi weinsberg', u'AfId': 2252078561, u'DAuN': u'Udi Weinsberg'}, {u'AuId': 2650840383, u'AfN': u'northeastern university', u'DAfN': u'Northeastern University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'stratis ioannidis', u'AfId': 12912129, u'DAuN': u'Stratis Ioannidis'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 6, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2021764424, u'AfN': u'technicolor', u'DAfN': u'Technicolor', u'S': 7, u'AuN': u'jean bolot', u'AfId': 2251387792, u'DAuN': u'Jean Bolot'}]","{u'CN': u'kdd', u'CId': 1130985203}",0,"{u'CIId': 2584280754, u'CIN': u'kdd 2017'}",2017-08-13,"{""DN"":""PNP: Fast Path Ensemble Method for Movie Design"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":176,""InvertedIndex"":{""How"":[0],""can"":[1,46],""we"":[2,40,45],""design"":[3,47,64],""a"":[4,56,93],""product"":[5],""or"":[6,18],""movie"":[7,29,63,163],""that"":[8,28,80,131,155],""will"":[9],""attract,"":[10],""for"":[11],""example,"":[12],""the"":[13,25,35,62,70,78,82,117],""interest"":[14],""of"":[15,27,72,77,84,97,127,169],""Pennsylvania"":[16],""adolescents"":[17],""liberal"":[19],""newspaper"":[20],""critics?"":[21],""What"":[22],""should"":[23,32],""be"":[24,33],""genre"":[26],""and"":[30,75,100,110,129,140,153,160,174],""who"":[31],""in"":[34],""cast?"":[36],""In"":[37],""this"":[38],""work,"":[39],""seek"":[41],""to"":[42,55,113],""identify"":[43],""how"":[44],""new"":[49],""movies"":[51,109],""with"":[52],""features"":[53,79,101,111],""tailored"":[54],""specific"":[57],""user"":[58,121],""population."":[59],""We"":[60,115,145],""formulate"":[61],""as"":[65],""an"":[66],""optimization"":[67],""problem"":[68],""over"":[69],""inference"":[71],""user-feature"":[73],""scores"":[74],""selection"":[76],""maximize"":[81],""number"":[83],""attracted"":[85],""users."":[86],""Our"":[87],""approach,"":[88],""PNP,"":[89],""is"":[90,157],""based"":[91],""on"":[92,148],""heterogeneous,"":[94],""tripartite"":[95],""graph"":[96],""users,"":[98,170],""movies,"":[99],""(e.g."":[102],""actors,"":[103],""directors,"":[104],""genres),"":[105],""where"":[106],""users"":[107],""rate"":[108],""contribute"":[112],""movies."":[114],""learn"":[116],""preferences"":[118],""by"":[119],""leveraging"":[120],""similarities"":[122],""defined"":[123],""through"":[124],""different"":[125,167],""types"":[126],""relations,"":[128],""show"":[130,154],""our"":[132],""method"":[133],""outperforms"":[134],""state-of-the-art"":[135],""approaches,"":[136],""including"":[137,171],""matrix"":[138],""factorization"":[139],""other"":[141],""heterogeneous"":[142],""graph-based"":[143],""analysis."":[144],""evaluate"":[146],""PNP"":[147],""publicly"":[149],""available"":[150],""real-world"":[151],""data"":[152],""it"":[156],""highly"":[158],""scalable"":[159],""effectively"":[161],""provides"":[162],""designs"":[164],""oriented"":[165],""towards"":[166],""groups"":[168],""men,"":[172],""women,"":[173],""adolescents."":[175]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1611.html#KoutraDBWIFB16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3098076&ftid=1899102&dwn=1""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02388""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1611.02388""}],""VFN"":""Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"",""VSN"":""KDD"",""DOI"":""10.1145/3097983.3098076"",""CC"":{""2162147932"":[""d distribution and it is being used as the userspeciﬁc threshold, then Fin Equation (4) can be replaced with the CDF of the logistic distribution, F S.

regularities obeyed by the r-hop neighborhood in real networks? We answer this question by identifying another power-law pattern that describes the relationship between the fractions of node pairs C(r) within r hops and the hop count r. This scale-free distribution is pervasive and describes a large variety of networks, ranging from social and urban to technological and biological networks. In particular, inspired by the definition of the fractal correlation dimension D2 on a point-set, we consider the hop-count r to be the underlying distance metric between two vertices of the network, and we examine the scaling of C(r) with r. We find that this relationship follows a power-law in real networks within the range 2 ≤ r ≤ d, where d is the effective diameter of the network, that is, the 90-th percentile distance. We term this relationship as power-hop and the corresponding power-law exponent as power-hop exponent h. We provide theoretical justification for this pattern under successful existing network models, while we analyze a large set of real and synthetic network datasets and we show the pervasiveness of the power-hop.",1302,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2414782537,msa_2414782537,-20.172,msa,msa_2414782537,03538,"[{u'AuId': 2514402881, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'chengxi zang', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Chengxi Zang'}, {u'AuId': 2113115369, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'peng cui', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Peng Cui'}, {u'AuId': 2668391791, u'AfN': u'university of miami', u'DAfN': u'University of Miami', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'chaoming song', u'AfId': 145608581, u'DAuN': u'Chaoming Song'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2111511002, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'wenwu zhu', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Wenwu Zhu'}]","{u'CN': u'www', u'CId': 1135342153}",0,"{u'CIId': 569948648, u'CIN': u'www 2017'}",2017-04-03,"{""DN"":""Quantifying Structural Patterns of Information Cascades"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":145,""InvertedIndex"":{""Information"":[0],""cascades"":[1,55,70,141],""are"":[2],""ubiquitous"":[3],""in"":[4,16,125,142],""both"":[5],""physical"":[6],""society"":[7],""and"":[8,19,31,85,127],""online"":[9],""social"":[10],""media,"":[11],""taking"":[12],""on"":[13,27],""large"":[14],""variations"":[15],""structures,"":[17],""dynamics"":[18,30],""semantics."":[20],""Although"":[21],""there"":[22],""has"":[23],""been"":[24],""much"":[25],""progress"":[26],""understanding"":[28],""the"":[29,65,74,91,102],""semantics"":[32],""of"":[33,59,68,94,96,104,113],""information"":[34,54,69,97,114,123,140],""cascades,"":[35,115],""little"":[36],""is"":[37,71],""known"":[38],""about"":[39],""their"":[40],""structural"":[41,66,92],""patterns."":[42],""In"":[43],""this"":[44],""paper,"":[45],""we"":[46,100],""explore"":[47],""a"":[48],""large-scale"":[49],""dataset"":[50],""including"":[51],""432"":[52],""million"":[53],""with"":[56],""explicit"":[57],""records"":[58],""spreading"":[60,86,124],""traces."":[61],""We"":[62,77],""find"":[63],""that"":[64],""complexity"":[67],""far"":[72],""beyond"":[73],""previous"":[75],""conjectures."":[76],""first"":[78],""propose"":[79],""seven-dimensional"":[80],""metrics,"":[81,106],""which"":[82],""reflect"":[83],""size"":[84],""orientation"":[87],""aspects,"":[88],""to"":[89,130,135],""quantify"":[90],""characteristics"":[93],""millions"":[95],""cascades."":[98],""Further,"":[99],""analyze"":[101],""correlations"":[103],""these"":[105],""finding"":[107],""some"":[108],""brand"":[109],""new"":[110,128],""structure"":[111],""patterns"":[112],""potentially"":[116],""providing"":[117],""insights"":[118],""into"":[119],""intrinsic"":[120],""mechanisms"":[121],""governing"":[122],""nature"":[126],""models"":[129],""forecast"":[131],""as"":[132,134],""well"":[133],""impose"":[136],""good"":[137],""control"":[138],""over"":[139],""real"":[143],""applications."":[144]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/www2017c.html#ZangCSF017""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3041021.3054214""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3054214""}],""VFN"":""International World Wide Web Conferences"",""VSN"":""WWW"",""DOI"":""10.1145/3041021.3054214"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Chengxi"",""LN"":""Zang"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Peng"",""LN"":""Cui"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Chaoming"",""LN"":""Song"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""Wenwu"",""LN"":""Zhu"",""S"":5}],""BV"":""WWW '17 Companion Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'information cascade', u'FId': 27286358}, {u'FN': u'structures', u'FId': 76728937}, {u'FN': u'social network', u'FId': 86256295}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2612538457,,en,0,"[2108858998, 2128893310, 2178843456, 2067344105, 1497522841, 2377801650, 2332939684]",quantifying structural patterns of information cascades,0,"[u'cascades', u'information', u'patterns', u'quantifying', u'structural']",2017,"Information cascades are ubiquitous in both physical society and online social media, taking on large variations in structures, dynamics and semantics. Although there has been much progress on understanding the dynamics and semantics of information cascades, little is known about their structural patterns. In this paper, we explore a large-scale dataset including 432 million information cascades with explicit records of spreading traces. We find that the structural complexity of information cascades is far beyond the previous conjectures. We first propose seven-dimensional metrics, which reflect size and spreading orientation aspects, to quantify the structural characteristics of millions of information cascades. Further, we analyze the correlations of these metrics, finding some brand new structure patterns of information cascades, potentially providing insights into intrinsic mechanisms governing information spreading in nature and new models to forecast as well as to impose good control over information cascades in real applications.",1052,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2612538457,msa_2612538457,-20.336,msa,msa_2612538457,03557,"[{u'AuId': 2165171050, u'AfN': u'university of sao paulo', u'DAfN': u'University of S\xe3o Paulo', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'robson l f cordeiro', u'AfId': 17974374, u'DAuN': u'Robson L.F.

guess labels for the remaining majority? How to spot images that need brand new labels different from the predefined ones? How to summarize these data to route the user's attention to what really matters? Here we answer all these questions. Specifically, we propose QuMinS, a fast, scalable solution to two problems: (i) Low-labor labeling (LLL) - given an image set, very few images have labels, find the most appropriate labels for the rest; and (ii) Mining and attention routing - in the same setting, find clusters, the top-N""O outlier images, and the N""R images that best represent the data. Experiments on satellite images spanning up to 2.25 GB show that, contrasting to the state-of-the-art labeling techniques, QuMinS scales linearly on the data size, being up to 40 times faster than top competitors (GCap), still achieving better or equal accuracy, it spots images that potentially require unpredicted labels, and it works even with tiny initial label sets, i.e., nearly five examples. We also report a case study of our method's practical usage to show that QuMinS is a viable tool for automatic coffee crop detection from remote sensing images.",1227,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2056284765,msa_2056284765,-20.379,msa,msa_2056284765,03676,"[{u'AuId': 1246077859, u'AfN': u'aristotle university of thessaloniki', u'DAfN': u'Aristotle University of Thessaloniki', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'maria giatsoglou', u'AfId': 21370196, u'DAuN': u'Maria Giatsoglou'}, {u'AuId': 1160284182, u'AfN': u'aristotle university of thessaloniki', u'DAfN': u'Aristotle University of Thessaloniki', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'despoina chatzakou', u'AfId': 21370196, u'DAuN': u'Despoina Chatzakou'}, {u'AuId': 2397954333, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'neil shah', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Neil Shah'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2045559396, u'AfN': u'aristotle university of thessaloniki', u'DAfN': u'Aristotle University of Thessaloniki', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'athena vakali', u'AfId': 21370196, u'DAuN': u'Athena Vakali'}]","{u'CN': u'pakdd', u'CId': 1178327129}",3,"{u'CIId': 31940654, u'CIN': u'pakdd 2015'}",2015-05-19,"{""DN"":""Retweeting Activity on Twitter: Signs of Deception"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":133,""InvertedIndex"":{""Given"":[0],""the"":[1,21,25,62,77,93,109],""re-broadcasts"":[2],""(i.e."":[3],""retweets)"":[4],""of"":[5,27,65,79,95,111,124],""posts"":[6],""in"":[7,97],""Twitter,"":[8],""how"":[9],""can"":[10,42],""we"":[11,60],""spot"":[12],""fake"":[13],""from"":[14,131],""genuine"":[15,68],""user"":[16],""reactions?"":[17],""What"":[18],""will"":[19],""be"":[20,43],""tell-tale"":[22],""sign"":[23],""—"":[24],""connectivity"":[26],""retweeters,"":[28],""their"":[29,56],""relative"":[30],""timing,"":[31],""or"":[32],""something"":[33],""else?"":[34],""High"":[35],""retweet"":[36,69],""activity"":[37,83],""indicates"":[38],""influential"":[39],""users,"":[40],""and"":[41,67,101,114],""monetized."":[44],""Hence,"":[45],""there"":[46],""are"":[47],""strong"":[48],""incentives"":[49],""for"":[50],""fraudulent"":[51,66,82],""users"":[52],""to"":[53,85],""artificially"":[54],""boost"":[55],""retweets'"":[57],""volume."":[58],""Here,"":[59],""explore"":[61],""identifi-"":[63],""cation"":[64],""threads."":[70],""Our"":[71],""main"":[72],""contribu-"":[73],""tions"":[74],""are:"":[75],""(a)"":[76],""discovery"":[78],""patterns"":[80],""that"":[81,107],""seems"":[84],""follow"":[86],""(the"":[87],""\""triangles"":[88],""\""a"":[89],""nd"":[90],""\""homogeneity\"""":[91],""patterns,"":[92],""formation"":[94],""micro-clusters"":[96],""appropriate"":[98],""feature"":[99],""spaces);"":[100],""(b)"":[102],""\""RTGen\"","":[103],""a"":[104,122],""realistic"":[105],""generator"":[106],""mimics"":[108],""behaviors"":[110],""both"":[112],""honest"":[113],""fraud-"":[115],""ulent"":[116],""users."":[117],""We"":[118],""present"":[119],""experiments"":[120],""on"":[121],""dataset"":[123],""more"":[125],""than"":[126],""6"":[127],""million"":[128],""retweets"":[129],""crawled"":[130],""Twitter."":[132]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-18038-0_10.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_10""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pakdd/pakdd2015-1.html#GiatsoglouCSFV15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_10""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD1015843""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_10""}],""VFN"":""Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"",""VSN"":""PAKDD"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-319-18038-0_10"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Maria"",""LN"":""Giatsoglou"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Despoina"",""LN"":""Chatzakou"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Neil"",""LN"":""Shah"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""Athena"",""LN"":""Vakali"",""S"":5}],""BV"":""Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"",""BT"":""p""}",3,"[{u'FN': u'internet privacy', u'FId': 108827166}, {u'FN': u'world wide web', u'FId': 136764020}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}]",746997338,,en,0,"[2101196063, 2061820396, 1983610133, 2112681514, 2098395374, 1969568357, 2148123869, 2163898372, 176212337, 2133591726, 1600782690, 81017276, 1996359281, 966149683, 1513521279, 2165745700, 2255111263]",retweeting activity on twitter signs of deception,0,"[u'activity', u'deception', u'retweeting', u'signs', u'twitter']",2015,"Given the re-broadcasts (i.e. retweets) of posts in Twitter, how can we spot fake from genuine user reactions?

Using four datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects (e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect of revisits in the popularity evolution of such objects. Secondly, we propose the Phoenix-R model which captures the popularity dynamics of individual objects.

To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven state estimation approach based on recent targeted investment on sensors, data storage, and computing devices. An architecture is proposed to use power system physics and pattern to systematically clean historical data and conduct supervised learning, where historical similar measurements and their states are used to learn the relationship between the current measurement and the state. In order to deal with nonlinearity, kernel trick is used to produce linear mapping in a carefully selected higher dimensional space. To speed up the data-driven approach for online services, we analyze power system data set and discover its clustering property due to the periodic pattern of power systems. This leads to significant dimension reduction and the idea of preorganizing data points in a tree structure for inquiry, leading to 1000 times speedup. Numerical results show that the proposed data-driven approach works well in a smart grid setting with increasing uncertainties and it produces an online state estimate excelling current industrial approach.",1221,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2342408507,msa_2342408507,-20.079,msa,msa_2342408507,03720,"[{u'AuId': 177157178, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'nikou gunnemann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Nikou G\xfcnnemann'}, {u'AuId': 316694267, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'stephan gunnemann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Stephan G\xfcnnemann'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'www', u'CId': 1135342153}",14,"{u'CIId': 123220197, u'CIN': u'www 2014'}",2014-04-07,"{""DN"":""Robust multivariate autoregression for anomaly detection in dynamic product ratings"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":157,""InvertedIndex"":{""User"":[0],""provided"":[1],""rating"":[2,35,51,85],""data"":[3],""about"":[4],""products"":[5],""and"":[6,147],""services"":[7],""is"":[8,126],""one"":[9],""key"":[10],""feature"":[11],""of"":[12,34,43,50,68,112],""websites"":[13],""such"":[14],""as"":[15,117],""Amazon,"":[16],""TripAdvisor,"":[17],""or"":[18,96],""Yelp."":[19],""Since"":[20],""these"":[21,105],""ratings"":[22],""are"":[23],""rather"":[24],""static"":[25],""but"":[26],""might"":[27],""change"":[28],""over"":[29,74],""time,"":[30],""a"":[31,44,48,71,115,118,129],""temporal"":[32],""analysis"":[33],""distributions"":[36],""provides"":[37],""deeper"":[38],""insights"":[39],""into"":[40],""the"":[41,58,65,84,100,109,136],""evolution"":[42],""products'"":[45],""quality."":[46],""Given"":[47],""time-series"":[49],""distributions,"":[52],""in"":[53,81,99],""this"":[54,89],""work,"":[55],""we"":[56,107,148],""answer"":[57],""following"":[59],""questions:"":[60],""(1)"":[61],""How"":[62,77],""to"":[63,78,94,135],""detect"":[64,79],""base"":[66,90,110],""behavior"":[67,111,125],""users"":[69,113],""regarding"":[70,114],""product's"":[72,101],""evaluation"":[73],""time?"":[75],""(2)"":[76],""points"":[80],""time"":[82],""where"":[83],""distribution"":[86],""differs"":[87],""from"":[88],""behavior,"":[91],""e.g.,"":[92],""due"":[93],""attacks"":[95],""spontaneous"":[97],""changes"":[98],""quality?"":[102],""To"":[103],""achieve"":[104],""goals,"":[106],""model"":[108],""product"":[116],""latent"":[119,124],""multivariate"":[120],""autoregressive"":[121],""process."":[122],""This"":[123],""mixed"":[127],""with"":[128],""sparse"":[130],""anomaly"":[131],""signal"":[132],""finally"":[133],""leading"":[134],""observed"":[137],""data."":[138],""We"":[139],""propose"":[140],""an"":[141],""efficient"":[142],""algorithm"":[143],""solving"":[144],""our"":[145],""objective"":[146],""present"":[149],""interesting"":[150],""findings"":[151],""on"":[152],""various"":[153],""real"":[154],""world"":[155],""datasets."":[156]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/www2014.html#GunnemannGF14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2568008&ftid=1444003&dwn=1""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2566486.2568008""}],""VFN"":""International World Wide Web Conferences"",""VSN"":""WWW"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2566486.2568008"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2020214545,""CoC"":9},{""Id"":1977290284,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":1995632843,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2029424893,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Nikou"",""LN"":""Günnemann"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Stephan"",""LN"":""Günnemann"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web"",""BT"":""p""}",14,"[{u'FN': u'sparsity of effects principle', u'FId': 195567710}, {u'FN': u'anomaly detection', u'FId': 739882}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2054526494,,en,3,"[1663973292, 2145962650, 2123649031, 2148694408, 2107861471, 2115177546, 2017288758, 2327683694, 2028781966, 2338990760, 2041022395, 2318032547, 2494268298, 1576242567, 1500063156, 2591651266, 2122951085, 2077242081, 129077257, 1574649625, 2129713756, 2034518400, 2159662257, 1511796008, 2126668712, 2038680758, 1501116416, 2299661106, 214581329]",robust multivariate autoregression for anomaly detection in dynamic product ratings,0,"[u'anomaly', u'autoregression', u'detection', u'dynamic', u'multivariate', u'product', u'ratings', u'robust']",2014,"User provided rating data about products and services is one key feature of websites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor, or Yelp. Since these ratings are rather static but might change over time, a temporal analysis of rating distributions provides deeper insights into the evolution of a products' quality. Given a time-series of rating distributions, in this work, we answer the following questions: (1) How to detect the base behavior of users regarding a product's evaluation over time? (2) How to detect points in time where the rating distribution differs from this base behavior, e.g., due to attacks or spontaneous changes in the product's quality? To achieve these goals, we model the base behavior of users regarding a product as a latent multivariate autoregressive process. This latent behavior is mixed with a sparse anomaly signal finally leading to the observed data.

Is it possible to model these patterns and tell if a user is a human or a bot based only on the timing of their postings? Social media services allow users to make postings, generating large datasets of human activity time-stamps. In this paper we analyze time-stamp data from social media services and find that the distribution of postings inter-arrival times (IAT) is characterized by four patterns: (i) positive correlation between consecutive IATs, (ii) heavy tails, (iii) periodic spikes and (iv) bimodal distribution. Based on our findings, we propose Rest-Sleep-and-Comment (RSC), a generative model that is able to match all four discovered patterns. We demonstrate the utility of RSC by showing that it can accurately fit real time-stamp data from Reddit and Twitter. We also show that RSC can be used to spot outliers and detect users with non-human behavior, such as bots. We validate RSC using real data consisting of over 35 million postings from Twitter and Reddit. RSC consistently provides a better fit to real data and clearly outperform existing models for human dynamics. RSC was also able to detect bots with a precision higher than 94%.",1254,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2078701302,msa_2078701302,-19.729,msa,msa_2078701302,03744,"[{u'AuId': 2164587646, u'AfN': u'pohang university of science and technology', u'DAfN': u'Pohang University of Science and Technology', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jinoh oh', u'AfId': 123900574, u'DAuN': u'Jinoh Oh'}, {u'AuId': 2226806500, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'kijung shin', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kijung Shin'}, {u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'university of california riverside', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Riverside', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 103635307, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos E.

For example, product reviews are quadruplets of (user, product, keyword, timestamp). How can we analyze such web-scale multi-aspect data? Can we analyze them on an off-the-shelf workstation with limited amount of memory?   Tucker decomposition has been widely used for discovering patterns in relationships among entities in multi-aspect data, naturally expressed as high-order tensors. However, existing algorithms for Tucker decomposition have limited scalability, and especially, fail to decompose high-order tensors since they explicitly materialize intermediate data, whose size rapidly grows as the order increases (≥ 4). We call this problem M-Bottleneck (""Materialization Bottleneck"").   To avoid M-Bottleneck, we propose S-HOT, a scalable high-order tucker decomposition method that employs the on-the-fly computation to minimize the materialized intermediate data. Moreover, S-HOT is designed for handling disk-resident tensors, too large to fit in memory, without loading them all in memory at once. We provide theoretical analysis on the amount of memory space and the number of scans of data required by S-HOT. In our experiments, S-HOT showed better scalability not only with the order but also with the dimensionality and the rank than baseline methods. In particular, S-HOT decomposed tensors 1000× larger than baseline methods in terms dimensionality. S- HOT also successfully analyzed real-world tensors that are both large-scale and high-order on an off-the-shelf workstation with limited amount of memory, while baseline methods failed.

In short, we want to find latent variables, that explain both the brain activity, as well as the behavioral responses.

We propose Scoup-SMT, a novel, fast, and parallel algorithm that solves the CMTF problem and produces a sparse latent low-rank subspace of the data. In our experiments, we find that Scoup-SMT is 50-100 times faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm for CMTF, along with a 5 fold increase in sparsity. Moreover, we extend Scoup-SMT to handle missing data without degradation of performance. We apply Scoup-SMT to BrainQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension. Scoup-SMT is able to find meaningful latent variables, as well as to predict brain activity with competitive accuracy.

Does it form spikes over time? Does it resemble the propagation pattern of benign files, such as software patches? Does it spread uniformly over countries? How long does it take for a URL that distributes malware to be detected and shut down? In this work, we answer these questions by analyzing patterns from 22 million malicious (and benign) files, found on 1.6 million hosts worldwide during the month of June 2011. We conduct this study using the WINE database available at Symantec Research Labs. Additionally, we explore the research questions raised by sampling on such large databases of executables; the importance of studying the implications of sampling is twofold: First, sampling is a means of reducing the size of the database hence making it more accessible to researchers; second, because every such data collection can be perceived as a sample of the real world. We discover the SharkFin temporal propagation pattern of executable files, the GeoSplit pattern in the geographical spread of machines that report executables to Symantec’s servers, the Periodic Power Law (Ppl) distribution of the lifetime of URLs, and we show how to efficiently extrapolate crucial properties of the data from a small sample. We further investigate the propagation pattern of benign and malicious executables, unveiling latent structures in the way these files spread. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the largest study of propagation patterns of executables.",1502,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_1975452715,msa_1975452715,-20.558,msa,msa_1975452715,03936,"[{u'AuId': 2133170407, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'angen zheng', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Angen Zheng'}, {u'AuId': 119288298, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'alexandros labrinidis', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Alexandros Labrinidis'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'icde', u'CId': 1163988186}",0,"{u'CIId': 2586032276, u'CIN': u'icde 2017'}",2017-04-01,"{""DN"":""Skew-Resistant Graph Partitioning"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":130,""InvertedIndex"":{""Large"":[0],""graph"":[1,8,13,21,36,49,87,109,126],""datasets"":[2],""have"":[3],""caused"":[4],""renewed"":[5],""interest"":[6],""for"":[7,34],""partitioning."":[9],""However,"":[10],""existing"":[11,54],""well-studied"":[12],""partitioners"":[14],""often"":[15],""assume"":[16],""that"":[17,98],""vertices"":[18,60,69],""of"":[19,47,85,119],""the"":[20,26,48,83,90,117,121,125],""are"":[22],""always"":[23],""active"":[24],""during"":[25],""computation,"":[27],""which"":[28],""may"":[29,70],""lead"":[30],""to"":[31,93,112],""time-varying"":[32],""skewness"":[33,114],""traversal-style"":[35],""workloads,"":[37],""like"":[38],""Breadth"":[39],""First"":[40],""Search,"":[41],""since"":[42],""they"":[43],""only"":[44],""explore"":[45],""part"":[46],""in"":[50],""each"":[51,61],""superstep."":[52],""Additionally,"":[53],""solutions"":[55],""do"":[56],""not"":[57],""consider"":[58],""what"":[59],""partition"":[62],""will"":[63,99],""have,"":[64],""as"":[65],""a"":[66,74],""result,"":[67],""high-degree"":[68],""be"":[71],""concentrated"":[72],""into"":[73,128],""few"":[75],""partitions,"":[76],""causing"":[77],""imbalance."":[78],""Towards"":[79],""this,"":[80],""we"":[81],""introduce"":[82],""idea"":[84],""skew-resistant"":[86],""partitioning,"":[88],""where"":[89],""objective"":[91],""is"":[92],""create"":[94],""an"":[95],""initial"":[96],""partitioning"":[97,110],""\""hold"":[100],""well\"""":[101],""over"":[102],""time"":[103],""without"":[104],""suffering"":[105],""from"":[106],""skewness."":[107],""Skewresistant"":[108],""tries"":[111],""mitigate"":[113],""by"":[115],""taking"":[116],""characteristics"":[118],""both"":[120],""target"":[122],""workload"":[123],""and"":[124],""structure"":[127],""consideration."":[129]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icde/icde2017.html#ZhengLF17""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Data Engineering"",""VSN"":""ICDE"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ICDE.2017.62"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Angen"",""LN"":""Zheng"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Alexandros"",""LN"":""Labrinidis"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'strength of a graph', u'FId': 19332903}, {u'FN': u'graph bandwidth', u'FId': 134727501}, {u'FN': u'level structure', u'FId': 181888306}, {u'FN': u'graph', u'FId': 136134403}, {u'FN': u'multi core processor', u'FId': 78766204}, {u'FN': u'graph partition', u'FId': 48903430}, {u'FN': u'network interface', u'FId': 103987645}, {u'FN': u'computational model', u'FId': 66024118}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'distributed computing', u'FId': 120314980}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2616221141,,,3,"[1976969221, 2170616854, 1971630691, 2006023152, 2064635301, 2065309575, 2133352850, 2139783166, 2111925081, 1997737152, 2189016707, 2164274587, 2414782537, 1980556808, 2422860174, 2583447318]",skew resistant graph partitioning,0,"[u'graph', u'partitioning', u'resistant', u'skew']",2017,"Large graph datasets have caused renewed interest for graph partitioning. However, existing well-studied graph partitioners often assume that vertices of the graph are always active during the computation, which may lead to time-varying skewness for traversal-style graph workloads, like Breadth First Search, since they only explore part of the graph in each superstep. Additionally, existing solutions do not consider what vertices each partition will have, as a result, high-degree vertices may be concentrated into a few partitions, causing imbalance. Towards this, we introduce the idea of skew-resistant graph partitioning, where the objective is to create an initial partitioning that will ""hold well"" over time without suffering from skewness. Skewresistant graph partitioning tries to mitigate skewness by taking the characteristics of both the target workload and the graph structure into consideration.",913,christos faloutsos,computer

real world graph, how should we lay-out its edges? How can we compress it? These questions are closely related, and the typical approach so far is to find clique-like communities, like the ‘cavemen graph’, and compress them. We show that the block-diagonal mental image of the ‘cavemen graph’ is the wrong paradigm, in full agreement with earlier results that real world graphs have no good cuts. Instead, we propose to envision graphs as a collection of hubs connecting spokes, with super-hubs connecting the hubs, and so on, recursively. Based on the idea, we propose the SlashBurn method to recursively split a graph into hubs and spokes connected only by the hubs. We also propose techniques to select the hubs and give an ordering to the spokes, in addition to the basic SlashBurn. We give theoretical analysis of the proposed hub selection methods. Our view point has several advantages: (a) it avoids the ‘no good cuts’ problem, (b) it gives better compression, and (c) it leads to faster execution times for matrix-vector operations, which are the back-bone of most graph processing tools. Through experiments, we show that SlashBurn consistently outperforms other methods for all data sets, resulting in better compression and faster running time. Moreover, we show that SlashBurn with the appropriate spokes ordering can further improve compression while hardly sacrificing the running time.",1409,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2060778826,msa_2060778826,-19.183,msa,msa_2060778826,03955,"[{u'AuId': 2103441981, u'AfN': u'university of california riverside', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Riverside', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xuetao wei', u'AfId': 103635307, u'DAuN': u'Xuetao Wei'}, {u'AuId': 1975627327, u'AfN': u'university of california riverside', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Riverside', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'nicholas c valler', u'AfId': 103635307, u'DAuN': u'Nicholas C.

Does it form spikes over time? Does it resemble the propagation pattern of benign files, such as software patches? Does it spread uniformly over countries? How long does it take for a URL that distributes malware to be detected and shut down?   In this work, we answer these questions by analyzing patterns from 22 million malicious (and benign) files, found on 1.6 million hosts worldwide during the month of June 2011. We conduct this study using the WINE database available at Symantec Research Labs. Additionally, we explore the research questions raised by sampling on such large databases of executables; the importance of studying the implications of sampling is twofold: First, sampling is a means of reducing the size of the database hence making it more accessible to researchers; second, because every such data collection can be perceived as a sample of the real world.   Finally, we discover the SharkFin temporal propagation pattern of executable files, the GeoSplit pattern in the geographical spread of machines that report executables to Symantec's servers, the Periodic Power Law (Ppl) distribution of the life-time of URLs, and we show how to efficiently extrapolate crucial properties of the data from a small sample.

u'data', u'driven', u'estimation', u'indexing', u'low', u'speed', u'state']",2014,"Traditional power system state estimation methods lack the ability to track and manage increasing uncertainties inherent in the new technologies, such as recent and ongoing massive penetration of renewable energy, distribution intelligence, and plug-in electric vehicles. To deal with the inability, a recent work proposes to utilize the unused historical data for power system state estimation. Although able to achieve much higher accuracy, the new approach is slow due to the burden by sequential similarity check over large volumes of high dimensional historical measurements, making it unsuitable for online services. This calls for a general approach to preprocess the historical data. In this paper, we propose to achieve such a goal with three steps. First, because the power systems are with periodic patterns, which create clustered measurement data, dimension reduction is proposed to remove redundancy, but still able to retrieve similar measurements. To further reduce the computational time, the k-dimensional tree indexing approach is employed in step two to group the clustered power system data into a tree structure, resulting in a log-reduction over searching time. Finally, we verify the obtained historical power system states via AC power system model and the current measurements to filter out bad historical data. Simulation results show that the new method can dramatically reduce the necessary computational time for online data-driven state estimation, while producing a highly accurate state estimate.",1529,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2068046847,msa_2068046847,-20.606,msa,msa_2068046847,04053,"[{u'AuId': 155875377, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'konstantinos pelechrinis', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Konstantinos Pelechrinis'}, {u'AuId': 1418764031, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'evangelos e papalexakis', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Evangelos Papalexakis'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]",,2,,2016-01-01,"{""DN"":""SportsNetRank: Network- based Sports Team Ranking"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":215,""InvertedIndex"":{""Which"":[0],""team"":[1,11],""is"":[2,28,49,109],""the"":[3,6,16,19,32,44,53,77,81,118,121,132,137,159,178,181,185,192,195,201],""best"":[4],""in"":[5,30,40,163,194],""league?"":[7,20],""How"":[8],""does"":[9],""my"":[10],""fare"":[12],""with"":[13,200],""respect"":[14],""to"":[15,46],""rest"":[17],""of"":[18,55,80,101,120,166,180],""These"":[21],""are"":[22,197],""questions"":[23,48],""that"":[24,124,144,157,191],""every"":[25,70],""sports"":[26,62,103],""fan"":[27],""interested"":[29],""knowing"":[31,43],""answers"":[33],""to."":[34],""In"":[35,59,89,105],""other"":[36],""cases,"":[37],""such"":[38],""as"":[39,169],""college"":[41],""sports,"":[42,61],""answer"":[45],""these"":[47],""crucial"":[50],""for"":[51],""shaping"":[52],""picture"":[54],""spe-"":[56],""cific"":[57],""contests."":[58],""professional"":[60],""networks"":[63],""provide"":[64,154],""power"":[65],""rankings"":[66],""regularly"":[67],""-"":[68,83],""typically"":[69],""week"":[71],""or"":[72],""month"":[73],""de-"":[74],""pending"":[75],""on"":[76,85,111,184,212],""season"":[78],""length"":[79],""league"":[82],""based"":[84,110,211],""their"":[86,126],""experts"":[87],""opinion."":[88],""this"":[90],""work"":[91],""we"":[92,142,189],""propose"":[93,205],""an"":[94,206],""alternative,"":[95],""ob-"":[96],""jective"":[97],""and"":[98,136,188],""network-based"":[99],""way"":[100],""ranking"":[102,156,209],""teams."":[104],""brief,"":[106],""our"":[107],""method"":[108],""analyzing"":[112],""a"":[113,155],""directed"":[114],""network"":[115,147,182,196],""formed"":[116],""between"":[117],""teams"":[119],""corresponding"":[122],""leagues"":[123],""captures"":[125],""win-lose"":[127],""relationships."":[128],""Using"":[129],""data"":[130],""from"":[131],""National"":[133,138],""Football"":[134],""League"":[135],""Basketball"":[139],""As-"":[140],""sociation,"":[141],""show"":[143,190],""even"":[145],""simple"":[146],""theory"":[148],""metrics"":[149],""(e.g.,"":[150,173],""Page"":[151],""Rank)"":[152],""can"":[153],""has"":[158],""same"":[160],""ac-"":[161],""curacy"":[162],""predicting"":[164],""winners"":[165],""upcoming"":[167],""match-ups"":[168],""more"":[170],""complicated"":[171],""systems"":[172],""Cortana)."":[174],""We"":[175,203],""further"":[176],""explore"":[177],""impact"":[179],""structure"":[183],""prediction"":[186],""accuracy"":[187],""cycles"":[193],""significantly"":[198],""correlated"":[199],""performance."":[202],""finally"":[204],""ad-"":[207],""vanced"":[208],""technique"":[210],""tensor"":[213],""decomposition."":[214]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/28337/""}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Konstantinos"",""LN"":""Pelechrinis"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Evangelos"",""LN"":""Papalexakis"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":3}],""BV"":"""",""BT"":""a""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'advertising', u'FId': 112698675}, {u'FN': u'operations management', u'FId': 21547014}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'engineering', u'FId': 127413603}]",2524410802,,en,0,,sportsnetrank network based sports team ranking,0,"[u'network', u'ranking', u'sports', u'sportsnetrank', u'team']",2016,"Which team is the best in the league?

In professional sports, sports networks provide power rankings regularly - typically every week or month de- pending on the season length of the league - based on their experts opinion. In this work we propose an alternative, ob- jective and network-based way of ranking sports teams. In brief, our method is based on analyzing a directed network formed between the teams of the corresponding leagues that captures their win-lose relationships. Using data from the National Football League and the National Basketball As- sociation, we show that even simple network theory metrics (e.g., Page Rank) can provide a ranking that has the same ac- curacy in predicting winners of upcoming match-ups as more complicated systems (e.g., Cortana). We further explore the impact of the network structure on the prediction accuracy and we show that the cycles in the network are significantly correlated with the performance.

detection of attacks of many sorts—from retweet boosting, hashtag hijacking to link advertising. Traditional approaches focus on detecting dense blocks in the adjacency matrix of graph data, and recently, the tensors of multimodal data. No method gives a principled way to score the suspiciousness of dense blocks with different numbers of modes and rank them to draw human attention accordingly. In this paper, we first give a list of axioms that any metric of suspiciousness should satisfy; we propose an intuitive, principled metric that satisfies the axioms, and is fast to compute; moreover, we propose  CrossSpot , an algorithm to spot dense blocks that are worth inspecting, typically indicating fraud or some other noteworthy deviation from the usual, and sort them in the order of importance (“suspiciousness”). Finally, we apply  CrossSpot  to the real data, where it improves the F1 score over previous techniques by  68 percent  and finds suspicious behavioral patterns in social datasets spanning  0.3 billion  posts.",1149,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2337240321,msa_2337240321,-20.186,msa,msa_2337240321,04057,"[{u'AuId': 2397954333, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'neil shah', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Neil Shah'}, {u'AuId': 2045447989, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'alex beutel', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alex Beutel'}, {u'AuId': 2188853992, u'AfN': u'lawrence livermore national laboratory', u'DAfN': u'Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'brian gallagher', u'AfId': 1282311441, u'DAuN': u'Brian Gallagher'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]","{u'CN': u'icdm', u'CId': 1183478919}",16,"{u'CIId': 199844461, u'CIN': u'icdm 2014'}",2014-12-01,"{""DN"":""Spotting Suspicious Link Behavior with fBox: An Adversarial Perspective"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":208,""InvertedIndex"":{""How"":[0],""can"":[1,21],""we"":[2,104],""detect"":[3],""suspicious"":[4,66,197],""users"":[5],""in"":[6,99,189],""large"":[7,73],""online"":[8],""networks?"":[9],""Online"":[10],""popularity"":[11,42],""of"":[12,27,49,63,75,94,117],""a"":[13,46,58,175],""user"":[14],""or"":[15,32],""product"":[16],""(via"":[17],""follows,"":[18],""page-likes,"":[19],""etc.)"":[20],""be"":[22,155],""monetized"":[23],""on"":[24,158,167,174],""the"":[25,92,115,136,141,168],""premise"":[26],""higher"":[28],""ad"":[29],""click-through"":[30],""rates"":[31],""increased"":[33],""sales."":[34],""Web"":[35],""services"":[36],""and"":[37,111,122,161,191],""social"":[38,185],""networks"":[39],""which"":[40,199],""incentivize"":[41],""thus"":[43],""suffer"":[44],""from"":[45,52,187],""major"":[47],""problem"":[48],""fake"":[50],""connections"":[51],""link"":[53],""fraudsters"":[54],""looking"":[55],""to"":[56,71,91,109,128,154,205],""make"":[57],""quick"":[59],""buck."":[60],""Typical"":[61],""methods"":[62,121],""catching"":[64],""this"":[65,102,206],""behavior"":[67],""use"":[68],""spectral"":[69,120],""techniques"":[70],""spot"":[72],""groups"":[74],""often"":[76],""blatantly"":[77],""fraudulent"":[78],""(but"":[79],""sometimes"":[80],""honest)"":[81],""users."":[82],""However,"":[83],""small-scale,"":[84,130],""stealthy"":[85],""attacks"":[86,132],""may"":[87],""go"":[88],""unnoticed"":[89],""due"":[90],""nature"":[93],""low-rank"":[95],""Eigen"":[96],""analysis"":[97],""used"":[98],""practice."":[100],""In"":[101],""work,"":[103],""take"":[105],""an"":[106,125],""adversarial"":[107],""approach"":[108],""find"":[110],""prove"":[112],""claims"":[113],""about"":[114],""weaknesses"":[116],""modern,"":[118],""state-of-the-art"":[119],""propose"":[123],""fBox,"":[124],""algorithm"":[126,139],""designed"":[127],""catch"":[129],""stealth"":[131],""that"":[133],""slip"":[134],""below"":[135],""radar."":[137],""Our"":[138],""has"":[140,147],""following"":[142],""desirable"":[143],""properties:"":[144],""(a)"":[145],""it"":[146,151,163],""theoretical"":[148],""underpinnings,"":[149],""(b)"":[150],""is"":[152,164],""shown"":[153],""highly"":[156],""effective"":[157],""real"":[159],""data"":[160],""(c)"":[162],""scalable"":[165],""(linear"":[166],""input"":[169],""size)."":[170],""We"":[171],""evaluate"":[172],""fBox"":[173],""large,"":[176],""public"":[177],""41.7"":[178],""million"":[179],""node,"":[180],""1.5"":[181],""billion"":[182],""edge"":[183],""who-follows-whom"":[184],""graph"":[186],""Twitter"":[188],""2010"":[190],""with"":[192],""high"":[193],""precision"":[194],""identify"":[195],""many"":[196],""accounts"":[198],""have"":[200],""persisted"":[201],""without"":[202],""suspension"":[203],""even"":[204],""day."":[207]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1410.html#ShahBGF14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://128.84.21.199/abs/1410.3915""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7023430/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2760638""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1171339""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1410.3915""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Data Mining"",""VSN"":""ICDM"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ICDM.2014.36"",""CC"":{""2129898896"":[""on rank kused in a given implementation.

Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales.

Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users. However, small-scale, stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank Eigen analysis used in practice.

online social media, taking on large variations in structures, dynamics and semantics. Although the dynamics and semantics of information cascades have been studied, the structural patterns and their correlations with dynamics and semantics are largely unknown. Here we explore a large-scale dataset including $432$ million information cascades with explicit records of spreading traces, spreading behaviors, information content as well as user profiles. We find that the structural complexity of information cascades is far beyond the previous conjectures. We first propose a ten-dimensional metric to quantify the structural characteristics of information cascades, reflecting cascade size, silhouette, direction and activity aspects. We find that bimodal law governs majority of the metrics, information flows in cascades have four directions, and the self-loop number and average activity of cascades follows power law. We then analyze the high-order structural patterns of information cascades. Finally, we evaluate to what extent the structural features of information cascades can explain its dynamic patterns and semantics, and finally uncover some notable implications of structural patterns in information cascades. Our discoveries also provide a foundation for the microscopic mechanisms for information spreading, potentially leading to implications for cascade prediction and outlier detection.",1472,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2742909326,msa_2742909326,-20.415,msa,msa_2742909326,04133,"[{u'AuId': 1524801041, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'danai koutra', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Danai Koutra'}, {u'AuId': 2426051778, u'AfN': u'kaist', u'DAfN': u'KAIST', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'u kang', u'AfId': 157485424, u'DAuN': u'U Kang'}, {u'AuId': 1971070670, u'AfN': u'max planck society', u'DAfN': u'Max Planck Society', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'jilles vreeken', u'AfId': 149899117, u'DAuN': u'Jilles Vreeken'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}]",,7,,2015-06-01,"{""DN"":""Summarizing and understanding large graphs"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":137,""InvertedIndex"":{""How"":[0,35],""can"":[1,18,28,36],""we"":[2,19,27,37,87,100],""succinctly"":[3,132],""describe"":[4,133],""a"":[5,9,14,42,48,78],""million-node"":[6],""graph"":[7,79,96],""with"":[8,52],""few"":[10],""simple"":[11],""sentences?"":[12],""Given"":[13],""large"":[15,49],""graph,"":[16],""how"":[17],""find"":[20,72],""its"":[21,134],""most"":[22,74,131],""\""important\"""":[23],""structures,"":[24],""so"":[25],""that"":[26,55,119,130],""summarize"":[29],""it"":[30],""and"":[31,65],""easily"":[32],""visualize"":[33],""it?"":[34],""measure"":[38],""the"":[39,53,73,102,106,117,122,127],""\""importance\"""":[40],""of"":[41,44,60,77,126],""set"":[43],""discovered"":[45],""subgraphs"":[46,91,115],""in"":[47,80],""graph?"":[50],""Starting"":[51],""observation"":[54],""real"":[56],""graphs"":[57],""often"":[58],""consist"":[59],""stars,"":[61],""bipartite"":[62],""cores,"":[63],""cliques,"":[64],""chains,"":[66],""our"":[67],""main"":[68],""idea"":[69],""is"":[70],""to"":[71],""succinct"":[75],""description"":[76,108],""these"":[81],""\""vocabulary\"""":[82],""terms."":[83],""To"":[84],""this"":[85],""end,"":[86],""first"":[88],""mine"":[89],""candidate"":[90],""using"":[92,105],""one"":[93],""or"":[94],""more"":[95],""partitioning"":[97],""algorithms."":[98],""Next,"":[99],""identify"":[101],""optimal"":[103],""summarization"":[104],""minimum"":[107],""length"":[109],""MDL"":[110],""principle,"":[111],""picking"":[112],""only"":[113],""those"":[114],""from"":[116],""candidates"":[118],""together"":[120],""yield"":[121],""best"":[123],""lossless"":[124],""compression"":[125],""graph-or,"":[128],""equivalently,"":[129],""adjacency"":[135],""matrix."":[136]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2076212/component/escidoc:2076211/arXiv:1406.3411.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3411""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.11267/abstract""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1406.html#KoutraKVF14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://experts.umich.edu/en/publications/summarizing-and-understanding-large-graphs""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2076212:3""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2913434.2913439""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sam.11267""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1406.3411""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/sam.11267""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://qa-pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2156208""}],""VFN"":""Statistical Analysis and Data Mining"",""V"":8,""I"":3,""FP"":183,""LP"":202,""DOI"":""10.1002/sam.11267"",""CC"":{""2165971212"":[""t mining [33]).

Could we have a generative model to create communication events with realistic inter-event time distributions (IEDs)? Which properties should we strive to match? Current literature has seemingly contradictory results for IED: some studies claim good fits with power laws; others with non-homogeneous Poisson processes. Given these two approaches, we ask: which is the correct one? Can we reconcile them all? We show here that, surprisingly, both approaches are correct, being corner cases of the proposed Self-Feeding Process (SFP). We show that the SFP (a) exhibits a unifying power, which generates power law tails (including the so-called ""top-concavity"" that real data exhibits), as well as short-term Poisson behavior; (b) avoids the ""i.i.d. fallacy"", which none of the prevailing models have studied before; and (c) is extremely parsimonious, requiring usually only  one , and in general,  at most two  parameters. Experiments conducted on eight large, diverse real datasets (e.g., Youtube and blog comments, e-mails, SMSs, etc) reveal that the SFP mimics their properties very well.",1208,christos

Are these keywords related? If so, are they competing against each other? Can we forecast the volume of user activity for the coming month? We conjecture that online activities compete for user attention in the same way that species in an ecosystem compete for food. We present ECOWEB, (i.e., Ecosystem on the Web), which is an intuitive model designed as a non-linear dynamical system for mining large-scale co-evolving online activities. Our second contribution is a novel, parameter-free, and scalable fitting algorithm, ECOWEB-FIT, that estimates the parameters of ECOWEB. Extensive experiments on real data show that ECOWEB is effective, in that it can capture long-range dynamics and meaningful patterns such as seasonalities, and practical, in that it can provide accurate long-range forecasts. ECOWEB consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed.",1059,christos faloutsos,computer science

Is it random? If not, what are the most apparent deviations from randomness -- a dense block of actors that persists over time, or perhaps a star with many satellite nodes that appears with some fixed periodicity? In practice, these deviations indicate patterns -- for example, botnet attackers forming a bipartite core with their victims over the duration of an attack, family members bonding in a clique-like fashion over a difficult period of time, or research collaborations forming and fading away over the years. Which patterns exist in real-world dynamic graphs, and how can we find and rank them in terms of importance? These are exactly the problems we focus on in this work. Our main contributions are (a)  formulation : we show how to formalize this problem as minimizing the encoding cost in a data compression paradigm, (b)  algorithm : we propose TIMECRUNCH, an effective, scalable and parameter-free method for finding coherent, temporal patterns in dynamic graphs and (c)  practicality : we apply our method to several large, diverse real-world datasets with up to  36 million  edges and  6.3 million  nodes.

Moreover, what users are doing now may be unrelated to what they will be doing in an hour from now. Mindful of these challenges we propose TribeFlow, a method designed to cope with the complex challenges of learning personalized predictive models of non-stationary, transient, and time-heterogeneous user trajectories. TribeFlow is a general method that can perform next product recommendation, next song recommendation, next location prediction, and general arbitrary-length user trajectory prediction without domain-specific knowledge.

We introduce TURBO-SMT, a meta-method capable of doing exactly that: it boosts the performance of any CMTF algorithm, by up to 200×, along with an up to 65 fold increase in sparsity, with comparable accuracy to the baseline.We apply TURBO-SMT to BRAINQ, a dataset consisting of a (nouns, brain voxels, human subjects) tensor and a (nouns, properties) matrix, with coupling along the nouns dimension.

Today, millions of people carrying smartphones or tablets are able to communicate practically any time and anywhere they want. They can access their e-mails, comment on weblogs, watch and post videos and photos (as well as comment on them), and make phone calls or text messages almost ubiquitously. Given this scenario, in this article, we tackle a fundamental aspect of this new era of communication: How the time intervals between communication events behave for different technologies and means of communications. Are there universal patterns for the Inter-Event Time Distribution (IED)q How do inter-event times behave differently among particular technologiesq To answer these questions, we analyzed eight different datasets from real and modern communication data and found four well-defined patterns seen in all the eight datasets. Moreover, we propose the use of the Self-Feeding Process (SFP) to generate inter-event times between communications. The SFP is an extremely parsimonious point process that requires at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the universal properties we observed in the data. We also show three potential applications of the SFP: as a framework to generate a synthetic dataset containing realistic communication events of any one of the analyzed means of communications, as a technique to detect anomalies, and as a building block for more specific models that aim to encompass the particularities seen in each of the analyzed systems.",1624,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2074522330,msa_2074522330,-20.318,msa,msa_2074522330,04809,"[{u'AuId': 236420169, u'AfN': u'university of toronto', u'DAfN': u'University of Toronto', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'christina christodoulakis', u'AfId': 185261750, u'DAuN': u'Christina Christodoulakis'}, {u'AuId': 2198983026, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'christos faloutsos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christos Faloutsos'}, {u'AuId': 2123327822, u'AfN': u'university of toronto', u'DAfN': u'University of Toronto', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'renee j miller', u'AfId': 185261750, u'DAuN': u'Renee J Miller'}]","{u'CN': u'icde', u'CId': 1163988186}",2,"{u'CIId': 146771650, u'CIN': u'icde 2014'}",2014-03-01,"{""DN"":""VoidWiz: Resolving incompleteness using network effects"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":112,""InvertedIndex"":{""If"":[0],""Lisa"":[1],""visits"":[2],""Dr."":[3],""Brown,"":[4],""and"":[5,83,99],""there"":[6],""is"":[7,57],""no"":[8],""record"":[9],""of"":[10,64,105],""the"":[11,36,108],""drug"":[12],""he"":[13],""prescribed"":[14],""her,"":[15],""can"":[16],""we"":[17],""find"":[18],""it?"":[19],""Data"":[20,39],""sources,"":[21],""much"":[22],""to"":[23,51,74],""analysts'"":[24],""dismay,"":[25],""are"":[26,44],""too"":[27],""often"":[28],""plagued"":[29],""with"":[30,41],""incompleteness,"":[31],""making"":[32,46],""business"":[33],""analytics"":[34],""over"":[35],""data"":[37,94],""difficult."":[38],""entries"":[40],""incomplete"":[42],""values"":[43,82],""ignored,"":[45],""some"":[47],""analytic"":[48],""queries"":[49],""fail"":[50],""accurately"":[52],""describe"":[53],""how"":[54],""an"":[55],""organization"":[56],""performing."":[58],""We"":[59,88],""introduce"":[60],""a"":[61,72,76,96],""principled"":[62],""way"":[63],""performing"":[65,100],""value"":[66,78],""imputation"":[67],""on"":[68,103],""missing"":[69],""values,"":[70],""allowing"":[71],""user"":[73],""choose"":[75],""correct"":[77],""after"":[79],""viewing"":[80],""possible"":[81],""why"":[84],""they"":[85],""were"":[86],""inferred."":[87],""achieve"":[89],""this"":[90],""by"":[91],""turning"":[92],""our"":[93],""into"":[95],""graph"":[97],""network"":[98],""link"":[101],""prediction"":[102],""nodes"":[104],""interest"":[106],""using"":[107],""belief"":[109],""propagation"":[110],""algorithm."":[111]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816748""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icde/icde2014.html#ChristodoulakisFM14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6816748/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.computer.org/web/csdl/index/-/csdl/proceedings/icde/2014/2555/00/06816748-abs.html""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816748""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Data Engineering"",""VSN"":""ICDE"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ICDE.2014.6816748"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Christina"",""LN"":""Christodoulakis"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Christos"",""LN"":""Faloutsos"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Renee J"",""LN"":""Miller"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""2014 IEEE 30th International Conference on Data Engineering"",""BT"":""p""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'belief propagation', u'FId': 152948882}, {u'FN': u'prediction', u'FId': 127011070}, {u'FN': u'algorithm design', u'FId': 106516650}, {u'FN': u'data visualization', u'FId': 172367668}, {u'FN': u'data science', u'FId': 2522767166}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'database', u'FId': 77088390}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",1987764636,,en,3,"[2135415614, 2138199375, 2019599312, 2017102965, 2107569009, 2124168655, 1539585011, 2047205327, 1975414584, 2092912084, 1997952460, 2101852873, 1529421386, 2113097177]",voidwiz resolving incompleteness using network effects,0,"[u'effects', u'incompleteness', u'network', u'resolving', u'voidwiz']",2014,"If Lisa visits Dr. Brown, and there is no record of the drug he prescribed her, can we find it?

We analyzed over 20,000 submissions corresponding to more than 100 million user interactions from three social voting Web sites: Reddit, Imgur and Digg. Our first contribution is two discoveries: (i) the number of comments grows as a power-law on the number of votes and (ii) the time between a submission creation and a user's reaction obeys a log-logistic distribution. Based on these patterns, we propose VnC (Vote-and-Comment), a parsimonious but accurate and scalable model that models the coevolution of user activities.

How do we automatically summarize millions of user reviews and make sense out of them? Unfortunately, beyond simple summaries such as histograms of user ratings, there are few analytic tools that can provide insights into user reviews. In this paper, we propose Wiscom, a system that can analyze tens of millions user ratings and comments in mobile app markets at three different levels of detail. Our system is able to (a) discover inconsistencies in reviews; (b) identify reasons why users like or dislike a given app, and provide an interactive, zoomable view of how users' reviews evolve over time; and (c) provide valuable insights into the entire app market, identifying users' major concerns and preferences of different types of apps. Results using our techniques are reported on a 32GB dataset consisting of over 13 million user reviews of 171,493 Android apps in the Google Play Store. We discuss how the techniques presented herein can be deployed to help a mobile app market operator such as Google as well as individual app developers and end-users.",1155,christos faloutsos,computer

users and sellers from an online recommendation site like Amazon - and labels for a few nodes ('honest', 'suspicious', etc), can we find a closed formula for Belief Propagation (BP), exact or approximate? Can we say whether it will converge?BP, traditionally an inference algorithm for graphical models, exploits so-called ""network effects"" to perform graph classification tasks when labels for a subset of nodes are provided; and it has been successful in numerous settings like fraudulent entity detection in online retailers and classification in social networks. However, it does not have a closed-form nor does it provide convergence guarantees in general. We propose ZooBP, a method to perform fast BP on undirected heterogeneous graphs with provable convergence guarantees. ZooBP has the following advantages: (1) Generality: It works on heterogeneous graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges; (2) Closed-form solution: ZooBP gives a closed-form solution as well as convergence guarantees; (3) Scalability: ZooBP is linear on the graph size and is up to 600× faster than BP, running on graphs with 3.3 million edges in a few seconds. (4) Effectiveness: Applied on real data (a Flipkart e-commerce network with users, products and sellers), ZooBP identifies fraudulent users with a near-perfect precision of 92.3 % over the top 300 results.",1434,christos faloutsos,computer science department,,,,msa_2584187726,msa_2584187726,-20.155,msa,msa_2584187726,01610,"[{u'AuId': 2224081511, u'AfN': u'singapore management university', u'DAfN': u'Singapore Management University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xuanbach d le', u'AfId': 79891267, u'DAuN': u'Xuan-Bach D.

a challenging process of detecting bugs, localizing buggy code, generating fix candidates and validating the fixes. Effectiveness of program repair methods relies on the generated fix candidates, and the methods used to traverse the space of generated candidates to search for the best ones. Existing approaches generate fix candidates based on either syntactic searches over source code or semantic analysis of specification, e.g., test cases. In this paper, we propose to combine both syntactic and semantic fix candidates to enhance the search space of APR, and provide a function to effectively traverse the search space. We present an automated repair method based on structured specifications, deductive verification and genetic programming. Given a function with its specification, we utilize a modular verifier to detect bugs and localize both program statements and sub-formulas in the specification that relate to those bugs. While the former are identified as buggy code, the latter are transformed as semantic fix candidates. We additionally generate syntactic fix candidates via various mutation operators. Best candidates, which receives fewer warnings via a static verification, are selected for evolution though genetic programming until we find one satisfying the specification.

A major complaint is that programmers often write minimal and low quality handlers. We used the Boa tool to examine a large number of Java projects on GitHub to provide empirical evidence about how programmers currently deal with exceptions. We found that programmers handle exceptions locally in catch blocks much of the time, rather than propagating by throwing an Exception. Programmers make heavy use of actions like Log, Print, Return, or Throw in catch blocks, and also frequently copy code between handlers. We found bad practices like empty catch blocks or catching Exception are indeed widespread. We discuss evidence that programmers may misjudge risk when catching Exception, and face a tension between handlers that directly address local program statement failure and handlers that consider the program-wide implications of an exception.

Many types of infrastructure are primarily comprised of arbitrarily-shaped thin structures (e.g., Truss bridges, steel frame buildings under construction, and transmission towers), which existing automatic modeling methods are incapable of handling. To address this issue, this paper presents an approach to automatically recognize and model beams, planes, and joints from a 3D point cloud containing a complex network of thin structures, and to recover their topology. In our approach, each beam is evolved from a seed by matching and aligning the cross section images. This growing algorithm can model beams with arbitrary cross sections. By performing the algorithm on a point connectivity graph, we distinguish beams from joints and improve the algorithm's robustness to closely spaced objects. In parallel, planes and joints are also extracted and modeled. The connectivity graph of these primitives allows for a compact, object-level understanding of the entire structure.

Specifically, we show that general energy minimization, even in the 2-label pairwise case, and planar energy minimization with three or more labels are exp-APX-complete. This finding rules out the existence of any approximation algorithm with a sub-exponential approximation ratio in the input size for these two problems, including constant factor approximations. Moreover, we collect and review the computational complexity of several subclass problems and arrange them on a complexity scale consisting of three major complexity classes -- PO, APX, and exp-APX, corresponding to problems that are solvable, approximable, and inapproximable in polynomial time. Problems in the first two complexity classes can serve as alternative tractable formulations to the inapproximable ones.

Domain adaptation methods attempt to address this problem, but usually assume that the source domain is specified a priori. We propose a two-step approach for situations where more than one source domain is available. The first step uses a small number of labeled examples to choose the source domain most similar to the target domain, while the second step uses traditional domain adaptation methods to further adapt the chosen source domain to the target data. We demonstrate this two-step domain adaptation algorithm in the context of style-independent building component recognition, which suffers from the problem of inter-domain performance degradation. In this case, different building styles represent the domains, and the task is to reverse engineer a new building of unknown style. We evaluate several variants of the two-step method, and experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing single-step methods on a dataset of nine building styles. We demonstrate the generality of the approach on a large, multi-domain dataset with 22 product review categories (i.e., Styles) from the natural language processing field.",1287,daniel huber,robotics institute,59dcb96b2bdc9e7b0a6ff321,wos_cs_504,,,msa_2180218354,-21.61,wos_pm,wos_cs_504,0541,"[{u'AuId': 56229955, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ivan ruchkin', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ivan Ruchkin'}, {u'AuId': 713569583, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'bradley r schmerl', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Bradley R.

Software component frameworks do not provide an explicit way to represent or reason about these processes. Meanwhile, hybrid program models have been successful in proving critical properties of discrete-continuous systems. These programs deal with diverse aspects of a cyber-physical system such as controller decisions, component communication protocols, and mechanical dynamics, requiring several programs to address the variation. However, currently these aspects are often intertwined in mostly monolithic hybrid programs, which are difficult to understand, change, and organize. These issues can be addressed by component-based engineering, making hybrid modeling more practical. This paper lays the foundation for using architectural models to provide component-based benefits to developing hybrid programs. We build formal architectural abstractions of hybrid programs and formulas, enabling analysis of hybrid programs at the component level, reusing parts of hybrid programs, and automatic transformation from views into hybrid programs and formulas.

Over the next two decades Pascal built 40 of these machines, of which nine survive today. Several good web resources describe the Pascaline, but to properly appreciate the sautoir, Pascal's kinetic energy solution to jam-free ripple carry, building a working replica is invaluable.   Thanks to the growing availability of rapid prototyping tools, it has become relatively easy for CS educators to fabricate physical artifacts to help students explore computational ideas. I've created a Pascaline kit using laser-cut acrylic and standard fasteners that can be assembled with just a screwdriver, pliers, and Loctite. High school or college students with minimal skills can put it together in a few hours and have a functioning calculator. Exploring the Pascaline's design is an engaging way to connect a milestone in the early history of computing with more modern theoretical concepts. Students can investigate questions such as: What makes a device ""digital""? (Slide rules have numeric scales but are analog devices.) How does nonlinearity produce discrete states in a continuous world? How are nonlinearities induced in the Pascaline vs. in digital electronics? How do the logic design concepts ""half adder"" and ""full adder"" map onto the components of the Pascaline? Is the Pascaline really adding, or merely counting? How does the Pascaline use nines complement arithmetic to perform subtraction, and why isn't it tens complement?

machine-reading biocuration systems typically use sentence-by-sentence information extraction to construct meaning representations for use by curators. This does not directly reflect the typical discourse structure used by scientists to construct an argument from the experimental data available within a article, and is therefore less likely to correspond to representations typically used in biomedical informatics systems (let alone to the mental models that scientists have). In this study, we develop Natural Language Processing methods to locate, extract, and classify the individual passages of text from articles’ Results sections that refer to experimental data. In our domain of interest (molecular biology studies of cancer signal transduction pathways), individual articles may contain as many as 30 small-scale individual experiments describing a variety of findings, upon which authors base their overall research conclusions. Our system automatically classifies discourse segments in these texts into seven categories (fact, hypothesis, problem, goal, method, result, implication) with an F-score of 0.68. These segments describe the essential building blocks of scientific discourse to (i) provide context for each experiment, (ii) report experimental details and (iii) explain the data’s meaning in context. We evaluate our system on text passages from articles that were curated in molecular biology databases (the Pathway Logic Datum repository, the Molecular Interaction MINT and INTACT databases) linking individual experiments in articles to the type of assay used (coprecipitation, phosphorylation, translocation etc.). We use supervised machine learning techniques on text passages containing unambiguous references to experiments to obtain baseline F1 scores of 0.59 for MINT, 0.71 for INTACT and 0.63 for Pathway Logic. Although preliminary, these results support the notion that targeting information extraction methods to experimental results could provide accurate, automated methods for biocuration.

We attempt to understand the effect of biased sampling on the accuracy of population structure analysis and individual ancestry recovery. We examined two commonly used methods for analyses of such datasets, ADMIXTURE and EIGENSOFT, and found that the accuracy of recovery of population structure is affected to a large extent by the sample used for analysis and how representative it is of the underlying populations. Using simulated data and real genotype data from cattle, we show that sample selection bias can affect the results of population structure analyses.

studies have used cluster analysis to identify phenotypic clusters of asthma with differences in clinical traits, as well as differences in response to therapy with anti-inflammatory medications. However, the correspondence between different phenotypic clusters and differences in the underlying molecular mechanisms of asthma pathogenesis remains unclear.  Objective  We sought to determine whether clinical differences among children with asthma in different phenotypic clusters corresponded to differences in levels of gene expression.  Methods  We explored differences in gene expression profiles of CD4 +  lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of 299 young adult participants in the Childhood Asthma Management Program study. We obtained gene expression profiles from study subjects between 9 and 14 years of age after they participated in a randomized, controlled longitudinal study examining the effects of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications over a 48-month study period, and we evaluated the correspondence between our earlier phenotypic cluster analysis and subsequent follow-up clinical and molecular profiles.  Results  We found that differences in clinical characteristics observed between subjects assigned to different phenotypic clusters persisted into young adulthood and that these clinical differences were associated with differences in gene expression patterns between subjects in different clusters. We identified a subset of genes associated with atopic status, validated the presence of an atopic signature among these genes in an independent cohort of asthmatic subjects, and identified the presence of common transcription factor binding sites corresponding to glucocorticoid receptor binding.  Conclusion  These findings suggest that phenotypic clusters are associated with differences in the underlying pathobiology of asthma. Further experiments are necessary to confirm these findings.",1945,eric xing,machine learning department,59dc76242bdc9e77bc6bb725,pubmed_126,,,msa_2239931343,-20.448,wos_pm,pubmed_126,02131,"[{u'AuId': 2637841383, u'AfN': u'tsinghua university', u'DAfN': u'Tsinghua University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'bin zhao', u'AfId': 99065089, u'DAuN': u'Bin Zhao'}, {u'AuId': 351197510, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'eric p xing', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Eric P.

The parameter server provides an easy-to-use shared interface for read/write access to an ML model's values (parameters and variables), and the SSP model allows distributed workers to read older, stale versions of these values from a local cache, instead of waiting to get them from a central storage. This significantly increases the proportion of time workers spend computing, as opposed to waiting. Furthermore, the SSP model ensures ML algorithm correctness by limiting the maximum age of the stale values. We provide a proof of correctness under SSP, as well as empirical results demonstrating that the SSP model achieves faster algorithm convergence on several different ML problems, compared to fully-synchronous and asynchronous schemes.",1006,eric xing,machine learning department,59dc78652bdc9e77bc6c1d83,pubmed_262,,,msa_2132737349,-18.306,wos_pm,pubmed_262,01012,"[{u'AuId': 2139376321, u'AfN': u'beihang university', u'DAfN': u'Beihang University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jiabei zeng', u'AfId': 82880672, u'DAuN': u'Jiabei Zeng'}, {u'AuId': 2155389266, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'wensheng chu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Wen-Sheng Chu'}, {u'AuId': 2101970311, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'fernando de la torre', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Fernando De la Torre'}, {u'AuId': 2125199914, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'jeffrey f cohn', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Jeffrey F.

Previous approaches address specific and known sources. However, many sources are unknown. To address the ubiquity of error, we propose a Confident Preserving Machine (CPM) that follows an easy-to-hard classification strategy. During training, CPM learns two confident classifiers. A confident positive classifier separates easily identified positive samples from all else, a confident negative classifier does same for negative samples. During testing, CPM then learns a person-specific classifier using ""virtual labels"" provided by confident classifiers. This step is achieved using a quasi-semi-supervised (QSS) approach. Hard samples are typically close to the decision boundary, and the QSS approach disambiguates them using spatio-temporal constraints. To evaluate CPM, we compared it with a baseline single-margin classifier and state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and boosting methods in three datasets of spontaneous facial behavior.

investigate a notion of behavioral genericity in the context of session type disciplines. To this end, we develop a logically motivated theory of parametric polymorphism, reminiscent of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic λ-calculus, but casted in the setting of concurrent processes. In our theory, polymorphism accounts for the exchange of abstract communication protocols and dynamic instantiation of heterogeneous interfaces, as opposed to the exchange of data types and dynamic instantiation of individual message types. Our polymorphic session-typed process language satisfies strong forms of type preservation and global progress, is strongly normalizing, and enjoys a relational parametricity principle. Combined, our results confer strong correctness guarantees for communicating systems. In particular, parametricity is key to derive non-trivial results about internal protocol independence, a concurrent analogous of representation independence, and non-interference properties of modular, distributed systems.",1020,frank pfenning,computer science department,,,,msa_1509279433,msa_1509279433,-19.945,msa,msa_1509279433,01247,"[{u'AuId': 2575659659, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'max willsey', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Max Willsey'}, {u'AuId': 2576204627, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'rokhini prabhu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Rokhini Prabhu'}, {u'AuId': 114048148, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'frank pfenning', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Frank Pfenning'}]",,1,,2017-01-17,"{""DN"":""Design and Implementation of Concurrent C0"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":61,""InvertedIndex"":{""We"":[0,46],""describe"":[1],""Concurrent"":[2,15],""C0,"":[3],""a"":[4,29,48],""type-safe"":[5],""C-like"":[6],""language"":[7,52],""with"":[8,51],""contracts"":[9],""and"":[10,42],""session-typed"":[11],""communication"":[12],""over"":[13],""channels."":[14],""C0"":[16],""supports"":[17],""an"":[18],""operation"":[19],""called"":[20],""forwarding"":[21],""which"":[22],""allows"":[23],""channels"":[24],""to"":[25],""be"":[26],""combined"":[27],""in"":[28],""well-defined"":[30],""way."":[31],""The"":[32],""language's"":[33],""type"":[34],""system"":[35],""enables"":[36],""elegant"":[37],""expression"":[38],""of"":[39],""session"":[40],""types"":[41],""message-passing"":[43],""concurrent"":[44],""programs."":[45],""provide"":[47],""Go-based"":[49],""implementation"":[50],""based"":[53],""optimizations"":[54],""that"":[55],""outperforms"":[56],""traditional"":[57],""message"":[58],""passing"":[59],""techniques."":[60]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04929""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/series/eptcs/eptcs238.html#WillseyPP17""}],""VFN"":""Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science"",""V"":238,""FP"":73,""LP"":82,""DOI"":""10.4204/EPTCS.238.8"",""CC"":{""882172233"":[""nlanguages,itprovidesconcurrentprocessesthatcommunicate overchannels.

These interrelated issues underpin advanced correctness analysis in models of structured communications. The starting point for our study is an interpretation of linear logic propositions as session types for communicating processes, proposed in prior work. Strong normalization and confluence are established by developing a theory of logical relations. Defined upon a linear type structure, our logical relations remain remarkably similar to those for functional languages. We also introduce a natural notion of observational equivalence for session-typed processes. Strong normalization and confluence come in handy in the associated coinductive reasoning: as applications, we prove that all proof conversions induced by the logic interpretation actually express observational equivalences, and explain how type isomorphisms resulting from linear logic equivalences are realized by coercions between interface types of session-based concurrent systems.",1071,frank pfenning,computer science department,,,,msa_2054150540,msa_2054150540,-20.42,msa,msa_2054150540,02904,"[{u'AuId': 2284275790, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'limin jia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Limin Jia'}, {u'AuId': 2179756142, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'hannah gommerstadt', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Hannah Gommerstadt'}, {u'AuId': 114048148, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'frank pfenning', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Frank Pfenning'}]","{u'CN': u'popl', u'CId': 1160032607}",8,"{u'CIId': 616154068, u'CIN': u'popl 2016'}",2016-01-11,"{""DN"":""Monitors and blame assignment for higher-order session types"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":138,""InvertedIndex"":{""Session"":[0],""types"":[1,79],""provide"":[2],""a"":[3,16,39,50,58,81,86],""means"":[4],""to"":[5,70,74,77],""prescribe"":[6],""the"":[7,45,92,95],""communication"":[8,54,73],""behavior"":[9,115],""between"":[10,55],""concurrent"":[11],""message-passing"":[12],""processes."":[13],""However,"":[14],""in"":[15,24,80,91,133],""distributed"":[17],""setting,"":[18,51],""some"":[19],""processes"":[20,56],""may"":[21,35],""be"":[22,36],""written"":[23],""languages"":[25],""that"":[26,108,120],""do"":[27],""not"":[28,112],""support"":[29],""static"":[30],""typing"":[31],""of"":[32,44,88,122,126,135],""sessions"":[33],""or"":[34],""compromised"":[37,132],""by"":[38],""malicious"":[40],""intruder,"":[41],""violating"":[42],""invariants"":[43],""session"":[46,78],""types."":[47],""In"":[48,64],""such"":[49],""dynamically"":[52,71],""monitoring"":[53,110],""becomes"":[57],""necessity"":[59],""for"":[60,116],""identifying"":[61],""undesirable"":[62,99],""actions."":[63],""this"":[65],""paper,"":[66],""we"":[67],""show"":[68],""how"":[69],""monitor"":[72,96],""enforce"":[75],""adherence"":[76],""higher-order"":[82],""setting."":[83],""We"":[84,106],""present"":[85],""system"":[87,114],""blame"":[89],""assignment"":[90],""case"":[93,134],""when"":[94],""detects"":[97],""an"":[98,102,123,136],""action"":[100],""and"":[101,119],""alarm"":[103],""is"":[104],""raised."":[105],""prove"":[107],""dynamic"":[109],""does"":[111],""change"":[113],""welltyped"":[117],""processes,"":[118],""one"":[121],""indicated"":[124],""set"":[125],""possible"":[127],""culprits"":[128],""must"":[129],""have"":[130],""been"":[131],""alarm."":[137]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2837614.2837662""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2837614.2837662""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/popl/popl2016.html#JiaGP16""}],""VFN"":""Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages"",""VSN"":""POPL"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2837614.2837662"",""RP"":[{""Id"":59370666,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2040105559,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Limin"",""LN"":""Jia"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Hannah"",""LN"":""Gommerstadt"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Frank"",""LN"":""Pfenning"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 43rd Annual ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages"",""BT"":""p""}",8,"[{u'FN': u'distributed computing', u'FId': 120314980}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'real time computing', u'FId': 79403827}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2264604278,,en,3,"[1784055113, 1607623316, 2128303158, 2150998213, 2154005761, 2153557668, 59370666, 2107399697, 2160241785, 1941373452, 776882319, 1537467263, 2040615980, 147632993, 2128496924, 2218092420, 2509692420, 2088295995, 1999161312, 2025260761, 1543368493, 1579463431, 1886109164, 2054150540, 2082415475, 2086165437, 102259843, 2044710350, 1563538580, 1526782485, 185648089, 158940444, 1934896223, 1458664253]",monitors and blame assignment for higher order session types,0,"[u'assignment', u'blame', u'higher', u'monitors', u'order', u'session', u'types']",2016,"Session types provide a means to prescribe the communication behavior between concurrent message-passing processes. However, in a distributed setting, some processes may be written in languages that do not support static typing of sessions or may be compromised by a malicious intruder, violating invariants of the session types. In such a setting, dynamically monitoring communication between processes becomes a necessity for identifying undesirable actions. In this paper, we show how to dynamically monitor communication to enforce adherence to session types in a higher-order setting. We present a system of blame assignment in the case when the monitor detects an undesirable action and an alarm is raised. We prove that dynamic monitoring does not change system behavior for welltyped processes, and that one of an indicated set of possible culprits must have been compromised in case of an alarm.",904,frank pfenning,computer science department,,,,msa_2264604278,msa_2264604278,-20.467,msa,msa_2264604278,03061,"[{u'AuId': 2675916422, u'S': 1, u'DAuN': u'Miguel Silva', u'AuN': u'miguel silva'}, {u'AuId': 2145228308, u'AfN': u'university of porto', u'DAfN': u'University of Porto', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'mario florido', u'AfId': 182534213, u'DAuN': u'M\xe1rio Florido'}, {u'AuId': 114048148, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'frank pfenning', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Frank Pfenning'}]",,0,,2017-01-17,"{""DN"":""Non-Blocking Concurrent Imperative Programming with Session Types"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":103,""InvertedIndex"":{""Concurrent"":[0],""C0"":[1],""is"":[2,33],""an"":[3],""imperative"":[4],""programming"":[5],""language"":[6,63],""in"":[7],""the"":[8,79,83,97],""C"":[9],""family"":[10],""with"":[11,27,73],""session-typed"":[12],""message-passing"":[13],""concurrency."":[14],""The"":[15],""previously"":[16],""proposed"":[17],""semantics"":[18],""implements"":[19],""asynchronous"":[20],""(non-blocking)"":[21],""output;"":[22],""we"":[23,69],""extend"":[24],""it"":[25],""here"":[26],""non-blocking"":[28,66],""input."":[29],""A"":[30],""key"":[31],""idea"":[32],""to"":[34,64],""postpone"":[35],""message"":[36],""reception"":[37],""as"":[38,40,46,56],""much"":[39],""possible"":[41],""by"":[42],""interpreting"":[43],""receive"":[44],""commands"":[45],""a"":[47,50,57,60,65,94,100],""request"":[48],""for"":[49],""message."":[51],""We"":[52],""implemented"":[53],""our"":[54,71],""ideas"":[55],""translation"":[58],""from"":[59],""blocking"":[61],""intermediate"":[62],""language."":[67],""Finally,"":[68],""evaluated"":[70],""techniques"":[72],""several"":[74],""benchmark"":[75],""programs"":[76],""and"":[77],""show"":[78],""results"":[80],""obtained."":[81],""While"":[82],""abstract"":[84],""measure"":[85],""of"":[86,96],""span"":[87],""always"":[88],""decreases"":[89],""(or"":[90],""remains"":[91],""unchanged),"":[92],""only"":[93],""few"":[95],""examples"":[98],""reap"":[99],""practical"":[101],""benefit."":[102]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1701.04920""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/series/eptcs/eptcs238.html#SilvaFP17""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04920""}],""VFN"":""Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science"",""V"":238,""FP"":64,""LP"":72,""DOI"":""10.4204/EPTCS.238.7"",""CC"":{""2129295475"":[""oit these improvements in practice.

This perspective suggests a model of computation that is inherently concurrent (to facilitate simultaneous message exchange) and that accounts for the effect of message exchange on an object's state (to express valid sequences of state transitions). In this paper we show that such a model of computation arises naturally from session-based communication. We introduce an object-oriented programming language that has processes as its only objects and employs linear session types to express the protocols of message exchange and to reason about concurrency and state. Based on various examples we show that our language supports the typical patterns of object-oriented programming (e.g., encapsulation, dynamic dispatch, and subtyping) while guaranteeing session fidelity in a concurrent setting. In addition, we show that our language facilitates new forms of expression (e.g., type-directed reuse, internal choice), which are not available in current object-oriented languages.

We also provide an approximate Delaunay graph on the output points. Our algorithm runs in expected time O(2 O(d) (n log n + m)), where n is the input size, m is the output point set size, and d is the ambient dimension. The constants only depend on the desired element quality bounds.   To gain this new efficiency, the algorithm approximately maintains the Voronoi diagram of the current set of points by storing a superset of the Delaunay neighbors of each point. By retaining quality of the Voronoi diagram and avoiding the storage of the full Voronoi diagram, a simple exponential dependence on d is obtained in the running time. Thus, if one only wants the approximate neighbors structure of a refined Delaunay mesh conforming to a set of input points, the algorithm will return a size 2 O(d) m graph in 2 O(d) (n log n + m) expected time.

Then, the extra points are removed in a straightforward way that allows the total work to be bounded in terms of the output complexity, yielding the output sensitive bound. The removal only involves local flips and is inspired by kinetic data structures.",874,gary miller,computer science department,,,,msa_1996532644,msa_1996532644,-21.181,msa,msa_1996532644,0438,"[{u'AuId': 2098010426, u'AfN': u'university of california santa barbara', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Santa Barbara', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'kevin deweese', u'AfId': 154570441, u'DAuN': u'Kevin Deweese'}, {u'AuId': 2125747468, u'AfN': u'university of california santa barbara', u'DAfN': u'University of California, Santa Barbara', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'john r gilbert', u'AfId': 154570441, u'DAuN': u'John R.

interest and progress recently in algorithms that solve regression problems involving tall and thin matrices in input sparsity time. Given a n * d matrix where n g d, these algorithms find an approximation with fewer rows, allowing one to solve a poly(d) sized problem instead. In practice, the best performances are often obtained by invoking these routines in an iterative fashion. We show these iterative methods can be adapted to give theoretical guarantees comparable to and better than the current state of the art. Our approaches are based on computing the importances of the rows, known as leverage scores, in an iterative manner. We show that alternating between computing a short matrix estimate and finding more accurate approximate leverage scores leads to a series of geometrically smaller instances. This gives an algorithm whose runtime is input sparsity plus an overhead comparable to the cost of solving a regression problem on the smaller approximation. Our results build upon the close connection between randomized matrix algorithms, iterative methods, and graph sparsification.",1125,gary miller,computer science department,,,,msa_2096908304,msa_2096908304,-19.428,msa,msa_2096908304,03019,"[{u'AuId': 149058271, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'guy e blelloch', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Guy E.

systems. On input an SDD n-by-n matrix A with m nonzero entries and a vector b, our algorithm computes a vector $\tilde{x}$ such that $\|\tilde{x} - A^{+}b\|_{A} \leq\varepsilon\cdot\|{A^{+}b}\|_{A}$ in $O(m\log^{O(1)}{n}\log {\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ work and $O(m^{1/3+\theta}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ depth for any ?>0, where A + denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of A.The algorithm relies on a parallel algorithm for generating low-stretch spanning trees or spanning subgraphs. To this end, we first develop a parallel decomposition algorithm that in O(mlog O(1) n) work and polylogarithmic depth, partitions a graph with n nodes and m edges into components with polylogarithmic diameter such that only a small fraction of the original edges are between the components. This can be used to generate low-stretch spanning trees with average stretch O(n ? ) in O(mlog O(1) n) work and O(n ? ) depth for any ?>0.

directed graphs: a weighted directed graph is α-balanced if for every cut  S  ⊆  V , the total weight of edges going from  S  to  V ∖  S  is within factor α of the total weight of edges going from  V ∖  S  to  S . Several important families of graphs are nearly balanced, in particular, Eulerian graphs (with α = 1) and residual graphs of (1+є)-approximate undirected maximum flows (with α= O (1/є)).   We use the notion of balance to give a more fine-grained understanding of several well-studied routing questions that are considerably harder in directed graphs. We first revisit oblivious routings in directed graphs. Our main algorithmic result is an oblivious routing scheme for  single-source  instances that achieve an  O (α · log 3   n  / loglog n ) competitive ratio. In the process, we make several technical contributions which may be of independent interest. In particular, we give an efficient algorithm for computing  low-radius decompositions  of directed graphs parameterized by balance. We also define and construct  low-stretch arborescences , a generalization of low-stretch spanning trees to directed graphs.   On the negative side, we present new lower bounds for oblivious routing problems on directed graphs. We show that the competitive ratio of oblivious routing algorithms for directed graphs is Ω( n ) in general; this result improves upon the long-standing best known lower bound of Ω(√ n ) by Hajiaghayi et al. We also show that our restriction to single-source instances is necessary by showing an Ω(√ n ) lower bound for multiple-source oblivious routing in Eulerian graphs.   We also study the maximum flow problem in balanced directed graphs with arbitrary capacities. We develop an efficient algorithm that finds an (1+є)-approximate maximum flows in α-balanced graphs in time  O ( m  α 2  / є 2 ).

Our work shows a close connection between these problems and core questions in algorithmic graph theory. While this connection demonstrates the difficulties of obtaining runtime guarantees, it also suggests an approach of using techniques originally developed for graph algorithms.   We then show that most of these problems can be formulated as a grouped least squares problem, and give efficient algorithms for this formulation.

Our approach follows the recursive preconditioning framework, which aims to reduce graphs to trees using iterative methods. We improve two key components of this framework: random sampling and tree embeddings. Both of these components are used in a variety of other algorithms, and our approach also extends to the dual problem of computing electrical flows.   We show that preconditioners constructed by random sampling can perform well without meeting the standard requirements of iterative methods. In the graph setting, this leads to ultra-sparsifiers that have optimal behavior in expectation.   The improved running time makes previous low stretch embedding algorithms the running time bottleneck in this framework. In our analysis, we relax the requirement of these embeddings to snowflake spaces. We then obtain a two-pass approach algorithm for constructing optimal embeddings in snowflake spaces that runs in  O ( m  log log  n ) time.

These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff between computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporate prior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we present a new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, thereby allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as L1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new framework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does; the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis.",1046,geoffrey gordon,machine learning

substantially to generating locomotion behaviours in humans and other legged animals. However, the neural circuitry involved in this spinal control remains unclear. We here propose a specific circuitry that emphasizes feedback integration over central pattern generation. The circuitry is based on neurophysiologically plausible muscle-reflex pathways that are organized in 10 spinal modules realizing limb functions essential to legged systems in stance and swing. These modules are combined with a supraspinal control layer that adjusts the desired foot placements and selects the leg that is to transition into swing control during double support. Using physics-based simulation, we test the proposed circuitry in a neuromuscular human model that includes neural transmission delays, musculotendon dynamics and compliant foot–ground contacts. We find that the control network is sufficient to compose steady and transitional 3-D locomotion behaviours including walking and running, acceleration and deceleration, slope and stair negotiation, turning, and deliberate obstacle avoidance. The results suggest feedback integration to be functionally more important than central pattern generation in human locomotion across behaviours. In addition, the proposed control architecture may serve as a guide in the search for the neurophysiological origin and circuitry of spinal control in humans.",1442,hartmut geyer,robotics institute,59dc76c12bdc9e77bc6bd342,pubmed_166,,,msa_1972148528,-19.803,wos_pm,pubmed_166,02505,"[{u'AuId': 2719138522, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'michal perdoch', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Michal Perdoch'}, {u'AuId': 2153374919, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'david m bradley', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'David M.

We consider a walking logistics support robot, which is designed to carry heavy loads to locations that are too difficult to reach with a wheeled or tracked vehicle. In this application the robot is carrying equipment and supplies for a group of pedestrians, and the primary task for the user interface is to keep the robot traveling with the overall group in the right formation. This paper presents a marker tracking system that uses near infrared cameras, retro-reflective markers, and LIDAR to allow a particular user to designate himself as the robot's leader, and guide the robot along a desired path.

computer science such as complexity analysis, compiler optimizations, security and privacy. Techniques based on program analysis, type systems and abstract interpretation are well-studied, but methods for analyzing how the execution costs of  two programs  compare to each other have not received attention. Naively combining the worst and best case execution costs of the two programs does not work well in many cases because such analysis forgets the similarities between the programs or the inputs.   In this work, we propose a  relational  cost analysis technique that is capable of establishing precise bounds on the difference in the execution cost of two programs by making use of relational properties of programs and inputs. We develop , a refinement type and effect system for a higher-order functional language with recursion and subtyping. The key novelty of our technique is the combination of relational refinements with two modes of typingâ  relational typing for reasoning about similar computations/inputs and unary typing for reasoning about unrelated computations/inputs. This combination allows us to analyze the execution cost difference of two programs more precisely than a naive non-relational approach.   We prove our type system sound using a semantic model based on step-indexed unary and binary logical relations accounting for non-relational and relational reasoning principles with their respective costs. We demonstrate the precision and generality of our technique through examples.",1611,jan hoffmann,computer science

presents a resource analysis system for OCaml programs. The system automatically derives worst-case resource bounds for higher-order polymorphic programs with user-defined inductive types. The technique is parametric in the resource and can derive bounds for time, memory allocations and energy usage. The derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials which are functions of different size parameters that depend on the standard OCaml types. Bound inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear optimization problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver. Technically, the analysis system is based on a novel multivariate automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA). It builds on existing work on linear AARA for higher-order programs with user-defined inductive types and on multivariate AARA for first-order programs with built-in lists and binary trees. This is the first amortized analysis, that automatically derives polynomial bounds for higher-order functions and polynomial bounds that depend on user-defined inductive types. Moreover, the analysis handles a limited form of side effects and even outperforms the linear bound inference of previous systems. At the same time, it preserves the expressivity and efficiency of existing AARA techniques. The practicality of the analysis system is demonstrated with an implementation and integration with Inria's OCaml compiler. The implementation is used to automatically derive resource bounds for 411 functions and 6018 lines of code derived from OCaml libraries, the CompCert compiler, and implementations of textbook algorithms. In a case study, the system infers bounds on the number of queries that are sent by OCaml programs to DynamoDB, a commercial NoSQL cloud database service.",1773,jan hoffmann,computer science department,59dc78d82bdc9e77bc6c322e,wos_cs_11,,,msa_2547267640,-19.912,wos_pm,wos_cs_11,04395,"[{u'AuId': 2169143086, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'sauvik das', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Sauvik Das'}, {u'AuId': 2139015025, u'AfN': u'facebook', u'DAfN': u'Facebook', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'adam d i kramer', u'AfId': 2252078561, u'DAuN': u'Adam D.I.

Here, we analyzed how three Facebook security features' Login Approvals, Login Notifications, and Trusted Contacts-diffused through the social networks of 1.5 million people. Our results suggest that social influence affects one's likelihood to adopt a security feature, but its effect varies based on the observability of the feature, the current feature adoption rate among a potential adopter's friends, and the number of distinct social circles from which those feature-adopting friends originate. Curiously, there may be a threshold higher than which having more security feature adopting friends predicts for higher adoption likelihood, but below which having more feature-adopting friends predicts for lower adoption likelihood. Furthermore, the magnitude of this threshold is modulated by the attributes of a feature-features that are more noticeable (Login Approvals, Trusted Contacts) have lower thresholds.",1038,jason hong,human-computer interaction institute,,,,,msa_2084885239,-20.483,none,,04716,"[{u'AuId': 2147689402, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'haoyu wang', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Haoyu Wang'}, {u'AuId': 2141131632, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jason i hong', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jason Hong'}, {u'AuId': 2258616044, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'yao guo', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Yao Guo'}]","{u'CN': u'ubicomp', u'CId': 1171345118}",8,"{u'CIId': 587012104, u'CIN': u'ubicomp 2015'}",2015-09-07,"{""DN"":""Using text mining to infer the purpose of permission use in mobile apps"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":115,""InvertedIndex"":{""Understanding"":[0],""the"":[1,32,39,78],""purpose"":[2,33],""of"":[3,19,34,41,49,80,92],""why"":[4],""sensitive"":[5,35,82],""data"":[6,36],""is"":[7],""used"":[8,65],""could"":[9],""help"":[10],""improve"":[11],""privacy"":[12],""as"":[13,15],""well"":[14],""enable"":[16],""new"":[17,28],""kinds"":[18,48],""access"":[20],""control."":[21],""In"":[22],""this"":[23],""paper,"":[24],""we"":[25],""introduce"":[26],""a"":[27,68],""technique"":[29],""for"":[30],""inferring"":[31,99,113],""usage"":[37],""in"":[38,77,98,112],""context"":[40,79],""Android"":[42],""smartphone"":[43],""apps."":[44],""We"":[45,72,101],""extract"":[46],""multiple"":[47],""features"":[50,57,62,107],""from"":[51],""decompiled"":[52],""code,"":[53],""focusing"":[54],""on"":[55],""app-specific"":[56],""and"":[58,86,88,95],""text-based"":[59,106],""features."":[60],""These"":[61],""are"":[63,109],""then"":[64],""to"":[66],""train"":[67],""machine"":[69],""learning"":[70],""classifier."":[71],""have"":[73,102],""evaluated"":[74],""our"":[75],""approach"":[76],""two"":[81],""permissions,"":[83],""namely"":[84],""ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"":[85],""READ_CONTACT_LIST,"":[87],""achieved"":[89],""an"":[90],""accuracy"":[91],""about"":[93],""85%"":[94],""94%"":[96],""respectively"":[97],""purposes."":[100,114],""also"":[103],""found"":[104],""that"":[105],""alone"":[108],""highly"":[110],""effective"":[111]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~wanghy11/papers/Wang-Ubicomp-15.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2805833""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/huc/ubicomp2015.html#WangHG15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2750858.2805833""}],""VFN"":""Ubiquitous Computing"",""VSN"":""UbiComp"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2750858.2805833"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2136649349,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":79696261,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":799327109,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":1963971515,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Haoyu"",""LN"":""Wang"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Jason"",""LN"":""Hong"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Yao"",""LN"":""Guo"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing"",""BT"":""p""}",8,"[{u'FN': u'android', u'FId': 557433098}, {u'FN': u'privacy', u'FId': 77804896}, {u'FN': u'internet privacy', u'FId': 108827166}, {u'FN': u'world wide web', u'FId': 136764020}, {u'FN': u'operating system', u'FId': 111919701}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'data mining', u'FId': 124101348}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",1998862130,,en,3,"[2101234009, 81879861, 2114275288, 2033811191, 2140095007, 2136649349, 2021124779, 2085577046, 86203326, 2168649891, 79696261, 2007784529, 2061603028, 2031573294, 2010395842, 799327109, 2123307077, 2019798206, 1968592516, 2170711609, 2098482696, 2038214200, 2144981153, 2102197271, 2026117671, 2065540202, 2098806750, 808035584, 2086069243, 2024722495]",using text mining to infer the purpose of permission use in mobile apps,0,"[u'apps', u'infer', u'mining', u'mobile', u'permission', u'purpose', u'text']",2015,"Understanding the purpose of why sensitive data is used could help improve privacy as well as enable new kinds of access control.

Previous work has emphasized face tracking and registration and the choice of features classifiers. Relatively neglected is the effect of imbalanced data for action unit detection. While the machine learning community has become aware of the problem of skewed data for training classifiers, little attention has been paid to how skew may bias performance metrics. To address this question, we conducted experiments using both simulated classifiers and three major databases that differ in size, type of FACS coding, and degree of skew. We evaluated influence of skew on both threshold metrics (Accuracy, F-score, Cohen's kappa, and Krippendorf's alpha) and rank metrics (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall curve). With exception of area under the ROC curve, all were attenuated by skewed distributions, in many cases, dramatically so. While ROC was unaffected by skew, precision-recall curves suggest that ROC may mask poor performance. Our findings suggest that skew is a critical factor in evaluating performance metrics. To avoid or minimize skew-biased estimates of performance, we recommend reporting skew-normalized scores along with the obtained ones.",1311,jeff cohn,robotics institute,59dc78602bdc9e77bc6c1c99,pubmed_261,,,msa_2068258779,-19.327,wos_pm,pubmed_261,0225,"[{u'AuId': 2013861978, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'luz rello', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Luz Rello'}, {u'AuId': 2159534029, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'miguel ballesteros', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Miguel Ballesteros'}, {u'AuId': 2112106364, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'jeffrey p bigham', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jeffrey P.

In this paper, we introduce a system called Real Check that uses a probabilistic language model, a statistical dependency parser and Google n-grams to detect real-world errors. We evaluated Real Check on text written by people with dyslexia, and showed that it detects more of these errors than widely used spellcheckers. In an experiment with 34 people (17 with dyslexia), people with dyslexia corrected sentences more accurately and in less time with Real Check.",935,jeffrey bigham,human-computer interaction institute,59dc800a2bdc9e77bc6d76e9,wos_cs_446,,,msa_1998834343,-21.946,wos_pm,wos_cs_446,0901,"[{u'AuId': 2344869853, u'AfN': u'university of michigan', u'DAfN': u'University of Michigan', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jinyeong yim', u'AfId': 27837315, u'DAuN': u'Jinyeong Yim'}, {u'AuId': 2344284465, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jeel jasani', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jeel Jasani'}, {u'AuId': 2344469144, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'aubrey henderson', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Aubrey Henderson'}, {u'AuId': 1524801041, u'AfN': u'university of michigan', u'DAfN': u'University of Michigan', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'danai koutra', u'AfId': 27837315, u'DAuN': u'Danai Koutra'}, {u'AuId': 2150089872, u'AfN': u'university of california san diego', u'DAfN': u'University of California, San Diego', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'steven p dow', u'AfId': 36258959, u'DAuN': u'Steven P.

These behavioral events may be instantaneous changes, continuous actions that span unbounded periods of time, or behaviors that would be best described by severity or other scalar ratings. The complexity of these judgments, coupled with the time and ei� ort required to meticulously assess video, results in a training and evaluation process that can take days or weeks. Computational analysis of video data is still limited due to the challenges introduced by objective interpretation and varied contexts. Glance [4] introduced a means of leveraging human intelligence by recruiting crowds of paid online workers to accurately analyze hours of video data in a matter of minutes. This approach has been shown to expedite work in human-centered i� elds, as well as generate training data for automated recognition systems. In this paper, we describe an interactive demonstration of an improved, more expressive version of Glance that expands the initial set of supported annotation formats (e.g. time range, classii� cation, etc.) from one to nine.

This conversion of speech to text is still done manually by humans, despite high cost, because the quality of automated speech recognition (ASR) is still too low in real-world settings. Manual conversion can require more than 5 times the original audio time, which also introduces significant latency. Giving transcriptionists ASR output as a starting point seems like a reasonable approach to making humans more efficient and thereby reducing this cost, but the effectiveness of this approach is clearly related to the quality of the speech recognition output. At high error rates, fixing inaccurate speech recognition output may take longer than producing the transcription from scratch, and transcriptionists may not realize when transcription output is too inaccurate to be useful. In this paper, we empirically explore how the latency of transcriptions created by participants recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk vary based on the accuracy of speech recognition output.

The key idea of our approach is an  online learning  algorithm that automatically constructs a series of local mixtures of autoregressive models (MAR) to capture the complex relationships between styles of motion. We construct local MAR models on the fly by searching for the closest examples of each input pose in the database. Once the model parameters are estimated from the training data, the model adapts the current pose with simple linear transformations. In addition, we introduce an efficient local regression model to predict the timings of synthesized poses in the output style. We demonstrate the power of our approach by transferring stylistic human motion for a wide variety of actions, including walking, running, punching, kicking, jumping and transitions between those behaviors. Our method achieves superior performance in a comparison against alternative methods. We have also performed experiments to evaluate the generalization ability of our data-driven model as well as the key components of our system.",1197,jessica hodgins,robotics

becoming increasingly prevalent as their price, form, and ease of use improves. Though these systems offer great potential value to users, many systems are hampered by issues that limit their ability to foster engagement, and people often abandon use of these systems without garnering meaningful outcomes. While continued use of these systems is not necessary for all people, there is an opportunity to better support people working towards achievement-based goals.   In this paper, we draw from the literature and our own prior work to identify a number of problems that hinder engagement with achievement-based personal informatics systems -- problems related to inadequate support for goal-setting, misalignment of user and system goals, and the burden of system maintenance. We then propose seven strategies for the design community to explore for mitigating these problems and discuss how these strategies could be used to foster engagement with PI systems.",996,jodi forlizzi,human-computer interaction institute,59dc7b512bdc9e77bc6ca2bd,wos_cs_162,,,msa_2412436369,-20.129,wos_pm,wos_cs_162,03329,"[{u'AuId': 2534004968, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'judeth oden choi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Judeth Oden Choi'}, {u'AuId': 2068668851, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jodi forlizzi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jodi Forlizzi'}, {u'AuId': 89134272, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'michael g christel', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Michael Christel'}, {u'AuId': 2623363114, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'rachel moeller', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Rachel Moeller'}, {u'AuId': 2539283755, u'S': 5, u'DAuN': u'MacKenzie Bates', u'AuN': u'mackenzie bates'}, {u'AuId': 2097339919, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 6, u'AuN': u'jessica hammer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jessica Hammer'}]","{u'CN': u'chi play', u'CId': 2626333002}",1,,2016-10-16,"{""DN"":""Playtesting with a Purpose"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":140,""InvertedIndex"":{""Playtesting,"":[0],""or"":[1],""using"":[2],""play"":[3],""to"":[4,69],""guide"":[5],""game"":[6,14,41,102],""design,"":[7,86],""gives"":[8],""designers"":[9,50,103],""feedback"":[10],""about"":[11],""whether"":[12],""their"":[13,17,117],""is"":[15],""meeting"":[16],""goals"":[18],""and"":[19,31,51,89,107,111,119,132],""the"":[20,56,76],""player's"":[21],""expectations."":[22],""We"":[23,43,71,91,127],""report"":[24],""a"":[25,34],""case"":[26],""study"":[27],""of"":[28,36,58,78],""designing,"":[29],""deploying,"":[30],""iterating"":[32],""on"":[33,138],""series"":[35],""playtesting"":[37,64,110],""workshops"":[38,74],""for"":[39,116],""novice"":[40,49,101],""designers."":[42],""identify"":[44],""common"":[45],""missteps"":[46,54],""made"":[47],""by"":[48,94],""address"":[52],""these"":[53],""through"":[55],""concept"":[57],""purposefulness,"":[59],""understanding"":[60],""why"":[61],""you"":[62],""are"":[63],""as"":[65,67],""well"":[66],""how"":[68],""playtest."":[70],""ground"":[72],""our"":[73,99,136],""in"":[75,98,124,135],""development"":[77],""rich"":[79],""player"":[80],""experience"":[81],""goals,"":[82,118],""which"":[83],""inform"":[84],""playtest"":[85,105,122],""data"":[87,112,123],""collection"":[88,113],""iteration."":[90],""show"":[92],""that"":[93],""applying"":[95],""methods"":[96,106,114],""taught"":[97],""workshops,"":[100],""leveraged"":[104],""tools,"":[108],""employed"":[109],""appropriate"":[115],""effectively"":[120],""applied"":[121],""iterative"":[125],""design."":[126],""conclude"":[128],""with"":[129],""lessons"":[130],""learned"":[131],""next"":[133],""steps"":[134],""research"":[137],""playtesting."":[139]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chiplay/chiplay2016.html#ChoiFCMBH16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2967934.2968103""}],""VFN"":""Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play"",""VSN"":""CHI PLAY"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2967934.2968103"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Judeth Oden"",""LN"":""Choi"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Jodi"",""LN"":""Forlizzi"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Michael"",""LN"":""Christel"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Rachel"",""LN"":""Moeller"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""MacKenzie"",""LN"":""Bates"",""S"":5},{""FN"":""Jessica"",""LN"":""Hammer"",""S"":6}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 2016 Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play"",""BT"":""p""}",1,"[{u'FN': u'game design', u'FId': 503285160}, {u'FN': u'human computer interaction', u'FId': 107457646}, {u'FN': u'multimedia', u'FId': 49774154}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2530983154,,en,3,"[132028353, 2079476777, 2003215225, 2223017844, 1531563883, 2078058017, 2033669857, 2112118808, 1506534339, 2045948237, 2339837478, 2397620706, 2093167252, 1982396023, 637373485]",playtesting with a purpose,0,"[u'playtesting', u'purpose']",2016,"Playtesting, or using play to guide game design, gives designers feedback about whether their game is meeting their goals and the player's expectations.

In this paper, an intention-integrated Prediction- and Cost function-Based algorithm (iPCB) framework is proposed to enable an autonomous vehicle to perform cooperative social behavior. An intention estimator is developed to extract the probability of surrounding agents' intentions in real time. Then for each candidate strategy, a prediction engine considering the interaction between host and surrounding agents is used to predict future scenarios.

The algorithm was tested in simulation on an autonomous vehicle cooperating with vehicles merging from freeway entrance ramps with 10,000 randomly generated scenarios.

Interestingly, envisioning apps with adaptive interfaces that reduce navigation and selection effort is not standard UX practice. When implementing an adaptive UI for our mobile transit app, we encountered a number of problems. Our original design did not log necessary information nor did it induce users to provide good labels. On reflection, we realized UX designers should identify and refine UI adaptions when sketching wireframes. To advance on this insight, we reviewed the interfaces of popular apps and extracted six design patterns where UI adaptation can improve in-app navigation. Next, we designed an exemplar set of wireframes, illustrating how UX designers might annotate their interaction flows to communicate planned adaptation and note the information (logs and labels) needed to make the desired inferences.",876,john zimmerman,human-computer interaction institute,59dc7b582bdc9e77bc6ca40b,wos_cs_164,,,msa_2417717420,-20.958,wos_pm,wos_cs_164,02800,"[{u'AuId': 2565024679, u'AfN': u'birla institute of technology and science', u'DAfN': u'Birla Institute of Technology and Science', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'aman ahuja', u'AfId': 74796645, u'DAuN': u'Aman Ahuja'}, {u'AuId': 2235903388, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'wei wei', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Wei Wei'}, {u'AuId': 2098520675, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'kathleen m carley', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kathleen M.

In contrast to other forms of media, such as newspaper, the text in these social media posts usually contains fewer words, and is concentrated on a much narrower selection of topics. For these reasons, traditional LDA-based sentiment and topic modeling techniques generally do not work well in case of social media data. Another characteristic feature of this data is the use of special meta tokens, such as hashtags, which contain unique semantic meanings that are not captured by other ordinary words. In the recent years, many topic modeling techniques have been proposed for social media data, but the majority of this work does not take into account the specialty of tokens, such as hashtags, and treats them as ordinary words. In this paper, we propose probabilistic graphical models to address the problem of discovering latent topics and their sentiment from social media data, mainly microblogs like Twitter. We first propose MTM (Microblog Topic Model), a generative model that assumes each social media post generates from a single topic, and models both words and hashtags separately. We then propose MSTM (Microblog Sentiment Topic Model), an extension of MTM, which also embodies the sentiment associated with the topics. We evaluated our models using Twitter dataset, and experimental results show that our models outperform the existing techniques.",1507,kathleen carley,institute for software research,59dc79b62bdc9e77bc6c5a61,wos_cs_59,,,msa_2585104877,-21.105,wos_pm,wos_cs_59,03755,"[{u'AuId': 1115070940, u'AfN': u'indraprastha institute of information technology', u'DAfN': u'Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'venkata m v gunturi', u'AfId': 119939252, u'DAuN': u'Venkata M.

A collection of all such social interactions among a group of individuals (or agents) observed over an interval of time is referred to as a temporally-detailed (TD) social network. A TD social network opens up the opportunity to explore TD questions on the underlying social system, e.g., “How is the betweenness centrality of an individual changing with time?” To this end, related work has proposed temporal extensions of centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness and closeness). However, scalable computation of these metrics for long time-intervals is challenging. This is due to the non-stationary ranking of shortest paths (the underlying structure of betweenness and closeness) between a pair of nodes which violates the assumptions of classical dynamic programming based techniques. To this end, we propose a novel computational paradigm called epoch-point based techniques for addressing the non-stationarity challenge of TD social networks. Using the concept of epoch-points, we develop a novel algorithm for computing shortest path based centrality metric such as betweenness on a TD social network. We prove the correctness and completeness of our algorithm. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed algorithm out performs the alternatives by a wide margin.",1455,kathleen carley,institute for software research,59dc78ac2bdc9e77bc6c2a12,wos_cs_2,,,msa_2514062356,-20.573,wos_pm,wos_cs_2,04392,"[{u'AuId': 2516030799, u'AfN': u'royal swedish academy of sciences', u'DAfN': u'Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'tracy van holt', u'AfId': 1341284090, u'DAuN': u'Tracy Van Holt'}, {u'AuId': 2331250248, u'AfN': u'university of florida', u'DAfN': u'University of Florida', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jeffery c johnson', u'AfId': 33213144, u'DAuN': u'Jeffery C.

on scientific influence within conflict research,0,"[u'conflict', u'datasets', u'influence', u'research', u'role', u'scientific']",2016,"We inductively tested if a coherent field of inquiry in human conflict research emerged in an analysis of published research involving “conflict” in the Web of Science (WoS) over a 66-year period (1945–2011). We created a citation network that linked the 62,504 WoS records and their cited literature. We performed a critical path analysis (CPA), a specialized social network analysis on this citation network (~1.5 million works), to highlight the main contributions in conflict research and to test if research on conflict has in fact evolved to represent a coherent field of inquiry. Out of this vast dataset, 49 academic works were highlighted by the CPA suggesting a coherent field of inquiry; which means that researchers in the field acknowledge seminal contributions and share a common knowledge base. Other conflict concepts that were also analyzed—such as interpersonal conflict or conflict among pharmaceuticals, for example, did not form their own CP. A single path formed, meaning that there was a cohesive set of ideas that built upon previous research. This is in contrast to a main path analysis of conflict from 1957–1971 where ideas didn’t persist in that multiple paths existed and died or emerged reflecting lack of scientific coherence (Carley, Hummon, and Harty, 1993). The critical path consisted of a number of key features: 1) Concepts that built throughout include the notion that resource availability drives conflict, which emerged in the 1960s-1990s and continued on until 2011. More recent intrastate studies that focused on inequalities emerged from interstate studies on the democracy of peace earlier on the path. 2) Recent research on the path focused on forecasting conflict, which depends on well-developed metrics and theories to model. 3) We used keyword analysis to independently show how the CP was topically linked (i.e., through democracy, modeling, resources, and geography). Publically available conflict datasets developed early on helped shape the operationalization of conflict. In fact, 94% of the works on the CP that analyzed data either relied on publically available datasets, or they generated a dataset and made it public.

behaviors, such as flocking. In many practical applications, human operators may need to change the current behavior of a swarm from the goal that the swarm was going towards into a new goal due to dynamic changes in mission objectives. There are two related but distinct capabilities needed to supervise a robotic swarm. The first is comprehension of the swarm's state and the second is prediction of the effects of human inputs on the swarm's behavior. Both of them are very challenging. Prior work in the literature has shown that inserting the human input as soon as possible to divert the swarm from its original goal towards the new goal does not always result in optimal performance (measured by some criterion such as the total time required by the swarm to reach the second goal). This phenomenon has been called Neglect Benevolence, conveying the idea that in many cases it is preferable to neglect the swarm for some time before inserting human input. In this paper, we study how humans can develop an understanding of swarm dynamics so they can predict the effects of the timing of their input on the state and performance of the swarm. We developed the swarm configuration shape-changing Neglect Benevolence Task as a Human Swarm Interaction (HSI) reference task allowing comparison between human and optimal input timing performance in control of swarms. Our results show that humans can learn to approximate optimal timing and that displays which make consensus variables perceptually accessible can enhance performance.",1644,katia sycara,robotics institute,59dcba392bdc9e7b0a701a47,wos_cs_560,,,msa_2062932390,-20.102,wos_pm,wos_cs_560,01218,"[{u'AuId': 2146531451, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ronghuo zheng', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ronghuo Zheng'}, {u'AuId': 2676851426, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ying xu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ying Xu'}, {u'AuId': 2620808666, u'AfN': u'stony brook university', u'DAfN': u'Stony Brook University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'nilanjan chakraborty', u'AfId': 59553526, u'DAuN': u'Nilanjan Chakraborty'}, {u'AuId': 2298025854, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'michael lewis', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Michael Lewis'}, {u'AuId': 2068240882, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'katia p sycara', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Katia P.

widely studied motivated by applications like spread of ideas or innovations in a network and viral marketing of products. Current studies focus almost exclusively on unsigned social networks containing only positive relationships (e.g. friend or trust) between users. Influence maximization in signed social networks containing both positive relationships and negative relationships (e.g. foe or distrust) between users is still a challenging problem that has not been studied. Thus, in this paper, we propose the polarity-related influence maximization (PRIM) problem which aims to find the seed node set with maximum positive influence or maximum negative influence in signed social networks. To address the PRIM problem, we first extend the standard Independent Cascade (IC) model to the signed social networks and propose a Polarity-related Independent Cascade (named IC-P) diffusion model. We prove that the influence function of the PRIM problem under the IC-P model is monotonic and submodular Thus, a greedy algorithm can be used to achieve an approximation ratio of 1-1/e for solving the PRIM problem in signed social networks. Experimental results on two signed social network datasets, Epinions and Slashdot, validate that our approximation algorithm for solving the PRIM problem outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",1380,katia sycara,robotics institute,59dc777f2bdc9e77bc6bf4f8,pubmed_208,,,msa_2112936255,-20.139,wos_pm,pubmed_208,04683,"[{u'AuId': 1965282487, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'steven nunnally', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Steven Nunnally'}, {u'AuId': 2106418249, u'AfN': u'university of pittsburgh', u'DAfN': u'University of Pittsburgh', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'phillip m walker', u'AfId': 170201317, u'DAuN': u'Phillip M.

These behaviors are not well built for accomplishing complex tasks, however, because of the changing assumptions required in various applications and environments. A new movement in the research field is to add human input to influence the swarm in order to help make the robots goal directed and overcome these problems. This research in Human Swarm Interaction (HSI) focuses on different control laws and ways to integrate the human intent with local control laws of the robots. Previous studies have all used visual feedback through a computer interface to give the user the swarm state information. This study adapted swarm control algorithms to give the operator hap tic feedback as well as visual feedback. The study shows the benefits of the additional feedback in a target searching class. Researchers in multi-robot systems have shown benefits of hap tic feedback in obstacle navigation before, but this study is a novel method because of the decentralized formation of the robotic swarm. In most environments, operators were able to cover significantly more area, increasing the chance of finding more targets. The other environment found no significant difference, showing that the hap tic feedback does not degrade performance in any of the tested environments. This supports our hypothesis that hap tic feedback is useful in HSI and requires further research to maximize its potential.",1553,katia sycara,robotics institute,59dcbf502bdc9e7b0a70db1f,wos_cs_829,,,msa_1979919698,-20.655,wos_pm,wos_cs_829,04243,"[{u'AuId': 311794911, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'kenneth r koedinger', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kenneth R.

Historically multimodal analyses of learning have been extremely laborious and time intensive. However, researchers have recently been exploring ways to use multimodal computational analysis in the service of studying how people learn in complex learning environments. In an effort to advance this research agenda, we present a comparative analysis of four different data segmentation techniques. In particular, we propose affect- and pose-based data segmentation, as alternatives to human-based segmentation, and fixed-window segmentation. In a study of ten dyads working on an open-ended engineering design task, we find that affect- and pose-based segmentation are more effective, than traditional approaches, for drawing correlations between learning-relevant constructs, and multimodal behaviors. We also find that pose-based segmentation outperforms the two more traditional segmentation strategies for predicting student success on the hands-on task. In this paper we discuss the algorithms used, our results, and the implications that this work may have in non-education-related contexts.",1169,louis-philippe morency,language technologies institute,59dc7f9e2bdc9e77bc6d63bc,wos_cs_420,,,msa_2294667110,-20.96,wos_pm,wos_cs_420,04665,"[{u'AuId': 2230208907, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'william melicher', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'William Melicher'}, {u'AuId': 272844514, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'darya kurilova', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Darya Kurilova'}, {u'AuId': 1662527006, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'sean m segreti', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Sean M.

However, this research has generally been in the context of desktops and laptops, while users are increasingly creating and entering passwords on mobile devices. In this paper we study whether recent password guidance carries over to the mobile setting. We compare the strength and usability of passwords created and used on mobile devices with those created and used on desktops and laptops, while varying password policy requirements and input methods. We find that creating passwords on mobile devices takes significantly longer and is more error prone and frustrating. Passwords created on mobile devices are also weaker, but only against attackers who can make more than 10^13 guesses. We find that the effects of password policies differ between the desktop and mobile environments, and suggest ways to ease password entry for mobile users.",944,lujo bauer,institute for software

images on smartphones that is sensitive to bandwidth and energy constraints. Our approach is inspired by the long-established practice of photographers using contact sheets to rapidly visualize a new collection of photographs, and then selecting a subset on which to focus attention. On behalf of each smartphone, the cloud maintains a virtual contact sheet of images that have been captured but not yet uploaded. The virtual contact sheet consists of a set of low-fidelity images as well as full or partial meta-data associated with each image. If search processing on the cloud indicates that a particular low-fidelity object is relevant, then its full-fidelity image can be obtained just-in-time from the corresponding smartphone for further search processing or presentation to the user. Our approach is not limited to images, but they provide a convenient query space to test search optimizations.",988,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_1975621741,msa_1975621741,-20.506,msa,msa_1975621741,0206,"[{u'AuId': 2516154956, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'junjue wang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Junjue Wang'}, {u'AuId': 2110147466, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'brandon amos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Brandon Amos'}, {u'AuId': 2153498352, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'anupam das', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Anupam Das'}, {u'AuId': 2193940368, u'AfN': u'intel', u'DAfN': u'Intel', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'padmanabhan pillai', u'AfId': 1343180700, u'DAuN': u'Padmanabhan Pillai'}, {u'AuId': 100648250, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'norman m sadeh', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Norman M.

It has low virtual I/O overhead, low latency for emitting file updates, and a scalable design.

These are located at the edge of the Internet, just one wireless hop away from associated mobile devices. By leveraging lowlatency offload, cloudlets enable a new class of real-time cognitive assistive applications on wearable devices. By processing high data rate sensor inputs such as video close to the point of capture, cloudlets can reduce ingress bandwidth demand into the cloud. By serving as proxies for distant cloud services that are unavailable due to failures or cyberattacks, cloudlets can improve robustness and availability. We caution that proprietary software ecosytems surrounding cloudlets will lead to a fragmented marketplace that fails to realize the full business potential of mobile-cloud convergence. Instead, we urge that the software ecosystem surrounding cloudlets be based on the same principles of openness and end-to-end design that have made the Internet so successful.",1100,mahadev

This use is not limited to the rapid adoption of facial recognition technology but extends to facial expression recognition, scene recognition and more. These developments raise privacy concerns and call for novel solutions to ensure adequate user awareness, and ideally, control over the resulting collection and use of potentially sensitive data. While cameras have become ubiquitous, most of the time users are not even aware of their presence. In this paper we introduce a novel distributed privacy infrastructure for the Internet-of-Things and discuss in particular how it can help enhance user's awareness of and control over the collection and use of video data about them. The infrastructure, which has undergone early deployment and evaluation on two campuses, supports the automated discovery of IoT resources and the selective notification of users. This includes the presence of computer vision applications that collect data about users. In particular, we describe an implementation of functionality that helps users discover nearby cameras and choose whether or not they want their faces to be denatured in the video streams.",1227,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_2741327137,msa_2741327137,-20.039,msa,msa_2741327137,0875,"[{u'AuId': 416104820, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'mahadev satyanarayanan', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mahadev Satyanarayanan'}, {u'AuId': 2144092273, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'phillip b gibbons', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Phillip B.

Objective  We sought to evaluate the performance of a novel classifier that uses decision forest classification of dermoscopic images to generate a lesion severity score.  Methods  Severity scores were calculated for 173 dermoscopic images of skin lesions with known histologic diagnosis (39 melanomas, 14 nonmelanoma skin cancers, and 120 benign lesions). A threshold score was used to measure classifier sensitivity and specificity. A reader study was conducted to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the classifier with those of 30 dermatology clinicians.  Results  The classifier sensitivity for melanoma was 97.4%; specificity was 44.2% in a test set of images. In the reader study, the classifier's sensitivity to melanoma was higher ( P  P   Limitations  This is a retrospective study using existing images primarily chosen for biopsy by a dermatologist. The size of the test set is small.  Conclusions  Our classifier may aid clinicians in deciding if a skin lesion should be biopsied and can easily be incorporated into a portable tool (that uses no proprietary equipment) that could aid clinicians in noninvasively evaluating cutaneous lesions.",1295,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_1952697361,msa_1952697361,-19.594,msa,msa_1952697361,01476,"[{u'AuId': 2232382118, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'zhuo chen', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Zhuo Chen'}, {u'AuId': 2118651624, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'lu jiang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Lu Jiang'}, {u'AuId': 2229759872, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'wenlu hu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Wenlu Hu'}, {u'AuId': 2486521600, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'kiryong ha', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kiryong Ha'}, {u'AuId': 2110147466, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'brandon amos', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Brandon Amos'}, {u'AuId': 2193940368, u'AfN': u'intel', u'DAfN': u'Intel', u'S': 6, u'AuN': u'padmanabhan pillai', u'AfId': 1343180700, u'DAuN': u'Padmanabhan Pillai'}, {u'AuId': 2113269357, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 7, u'AuN': u'alexander g hauptmann', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alexander G.

While studies have shown these to be idle most of the time, they remain powered, consuming up to 60p of their peak power. Hardware-based solutions engendered by PC vendors (e.g., low-power states, Wake-on-LAN) have proved unsuccessful because, in spite of user inactivity, these machines often need to remain network active in support of background applications that maintain network presence. Recent proposals have advocated the use of consolidation of idle desktop Virtual Machines (VMs). However, desktop VMs are often large, requiring gigabytes of memory. Consolidating such VMs creates large network transfers lasting in the order of minutes and utilizes server memory inefficiently. When multiple VMs migrate concurrently, networks become congested, and the resulting migration latencies are prohibitive. We present  partial VM migration,  an approach that transparently migrates only the working set of an idle VM. It creates a partial replica of the desktop VM on the consolidation server by copying only VM metadata, and it transfers pages to the server on-demand, as the VM accesses them. This approach places desktop PCs in low-power mode when inactive and switches them to running mode when pages are needed by the VM running on the consolidation server. To ensure that desktops save energy, we have developed sleep scheduling and prefetching algorithms, as well as the  context-aware selective resume  framework, a novel approach to reduce the latency of power mode transition operations in commodity PCs. Jettison, our software prototype of partial VM migration for off-the-shelf PCs, can deliver 44--91p energy savings during idle periods of at least 10 minutes, while providing low migration latencies of about 4 seconds and migrating minimal state that is under an order of magnitude of the VM’s memory footprint.",1882,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science

computing. VM-based cloudlets have been proposed as offload sites for the resource-intensive and latency-sensitive computations typically associated with mobile multimedia applications. Since cloud offload relies on precisely-configured back-end software, it is difficult to support at global scale across cloudlets in multiple domains. To address this problem, we describe just-in-time (JIT) provisioning of cloudlets under the control of an associated mobile device. Using a suite of five representative mobile applications, we demonstrate a prototype system that is capable of provisioning a cloudlet with a non-trivial VM image in 10 seconds. This speed is achieved through dynamic VM synthesis and a series of optimizations to aggressively reduce transfer costs and startup latency.",837,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_2111581171,msa_2111581171,-18.499,msa,msa_2111581171,02685,"[{u'AuId': 2147336715, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yu xiao', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yu Xiao'}, {u'AuId': 2114043725, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'pieter simoens', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Pieter Simoens'}, {u'AuId': 2193940368, u'AfN': u'intel', u'DAfN': u'Intel', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'padmanabhan pillai', u'AfId': 1343180700, u'DAuN': u'Padmanabhan Pillai'}, {u'AuId': 2486521600, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'kiryong ha', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kiryong Ha'}, {u'AuId': 416104820, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'mahadev satyanarayanan', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mahadev Satyanarayanan'}]",,53,,2013-02-26,"{""DN"":""Lowering the barriers to large-scale mobile crowdsensing"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":71,""InvertedIndex"":{""Mobile"":[0],""crowdsensing"":[1,18,55],""is"":[2,23],""becoming"":[3],""a"":[4,25,30],""vital"":[5],""technique"":[6],""for"":[7],""environment"":[8],""monitoring,"":[9],""infrastructure"":[10],""management,"":[11],""and"":[12,57],""social"":[13],""computing."":[14],""However,"":[15],""deploying"":[16],""mobile"":[17,39,54],""applications"":[19],""in"":[20],""large-scale"":[21],""environments"":[22],""not"":[24],""trivial"":[26],""task."":[27],""It"":[28],""creates"":[29],""tremendous"":[31],""burden"":[32],""on"":[33,63],""application"":[34],""developers"":[35],""as"":[36,38],""well"":[37],""users."":[40],""In"":[41],""this"":[42],""paper"":[43],""we"":[44],""try"":[45],""to"":[46,58,67],""reveal"":[47],""the"":[48,51,64,69],""barriers"":[49],""hampering"":[50],""scale-up"":[52],""of"":[53],""applications,"":[56],""offer"":[59],""our"":[60],""initial"":[61],""thoughts"":[62],""potential"":[65],""solutions"":[66],""lowering"":[68],""barriers."":[70]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.hotmobile.org/2013/papers/full/1.pdf""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/3259159/file/3259160.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2444789""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2444776.2444789""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wmcsa/hotmobile2013.html#XiaoSPHS13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/3259159""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/publication(b1ba528a-b119-4cf4-92ca-fe6ca89305ec).html""}],""DOI"":""10.1145/2444776.2444789"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2162192698,""CoC"":24},{""Id"":2125826911,""CoC"":23},{""Id"":2164297046,""CoC"":13},{""Id"":2137100320,""CoC"":12},{""Id"":1964375680,""CoC"":10},{""Id"":2121454265,""CoC"":10},{""Id"":2135099885,""CoC"":10},{""Id"":2146697949,""CoC"":10},{""Id"":1970756365,""CoC"":9},{""Id"":1553085258,""CoC"":8},{""Id"":2055665526,""CoC"":8},{""Id"":2127347346,""CoC"":8},{""Id"":1991642373,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2006974280,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":1994500462,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2009985677,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2122005484,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2144169341,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":1969841539,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":1982467666,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Yu"",""LN"":""Xiao"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Pieter"",""LN"":""Simoens"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Padmanabhan"",""LN"":""Pillai"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Kiryong"",""LN"":""Ha"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""Mahadev"",""LN"":""Satyanarayanan"",""S"":5}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 14th Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications"",""BT"":""p""}",73,"[{u'FN': u'embedded system', u'FId': 149635348}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'engineering', u'FId': 127413603}]",2019780447,,en,3,"[2135099885, 2101788345, 2114623221, 2140251882, 2125826911, 2088692353, 2108950108, 2083357144, 2152918251, 2009985677, 2162192698, 2138965424, 1977093441, 2112084485, 2144007439, 2142516160, 2096519149, 2165413796, 2150882603, 2162203086, 2161897659, 2046996006, 2169270531, 2054153630, 1980365054, 2117849405, 2077024248, 2155716554, 2019222686, 2076827356, 2021599021, 2059795891]",lowering the barriers to large scale mobile crowdsensing,0,"[u'barriers', u'crowdsensing', u'large', u'lowering', u'mobile', u'scale']",2013,"Mobile crowdsensing is becoming a vital technique for environment monitoring, infrastructure management, and social computing.

pathology, digital slides present major challenges in data storage, transmission, processing and interoperability. Since no universal data format is in widespread use for these images today, each vendor defines its own proprietary data formats, analysis tools, viewers and software libraries. This creates issues not only for pathologists, but also for interoperability. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OpenSlide ,  a vendor-neutral C library for reading and manipulating digital slides of diverse vendor formats. The library is extensible and easily interfaced to various programming languages. An application written to the OpenSlide interface can transparently handle multiple vendor formats.

Our solution constructs a virtual storage device on demand (which we call  transient storage ) by borrowing free disk blocks from the host’s storage. In this article, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a TransPart prototype, which requires no modifications to the software or hardware of a host computer.

The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the cloud. This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of today's cloud-based IoT hub designs. We propose a solution that interposes a locally-controlled software component called a privacy mediator on every raw sensor stream. Each mediator is in the same administrative domain as the sensors whose data is being collected, and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners of the sensors or mobile users within the domain. This solution necessitates a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative boundaries of each organization. Such points of presence are provided by cloudlets, which are small locally-administered data centers at the edge of the Internet that can support code mobility.

collection of crowd-sourced video from devices such as Google Glass. Our hybrid cloud architecture, GigaSight, is effectively a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in reverse. It achieves scalability by decentralizing the collection infrastructure using cloudlets based on virtual machines~(VMs). Based on time, location, and content, privacy sensitive information is automatically removed from the video.

We present enlightened post-copy, a new mechanism for VMs under contention that evicts the target VM with fast execution transfer and short total duration. This design contrasts with common live migration, which uses the down time of the migrated VM as its primary metric; it instead focuses on recovering the aggregate performance of the VMs being affected. In enlightened post-copy, the guest OS identifies memory state that is expected to encompass the VM's working set. The hypervisor accordingly transfers its state, mitigating the performance impact on the migrated VM resulting from post-copy transfer. We show that our implementation, with modest instrumentation in guest Linux, resolves VM contention up to several times faster than live migration.",869,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_2321806367,msa_2321806367,-19.923,msa,msa_2321806367,04814,"[{u'AuId': 2485713002, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yoshihisa abe', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yoshihisa Abe'}, {u'AuId': 2343219299, u'AfN': u'columbia university', u'DAfN': u'Columbia University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'roxana geambasu', u'AfId': 78577930, u'DAuN': u'Roxana Geambasu'}, {u'AuId': 2308675044, u'AfN': u'at t', u'DAfN': u'AT&T', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'kaustubh r joshi', u'AfId': 1283103587, u'DAuN': u'Kaustubh R.

In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to create a VA cloud service that supports fluid, interactive user experience even over mobile networks. More specifically, we wish to support a  YouTube-like streaming service for executable content , such as games, interactive books, research artifacts, etc. Users should be able to post, browse through, and interact with executable content swiftly and without long interruptions. Intuitively, this seems impossible; the bandwidths, latencies, and costs of last-mile networks would be prohibitive given the sheer sizes of virtual machines! Yet, we show that a set of carefully crafted, novel prefetching and streaming techniques can bring this goal surprisingly close to reality. We show that  vTube , a VA streaming system that incorporates our techniques, supports fluid interaction even in challenging network conditions, such as 4G LTE.",1056,mahadev satyanarayanan,computer science department,,,,msa_2115860724,msa_2115860724,-19.89,msa,msa_2115860724,0861,"[{u'AuId': 2132903572, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'mehdi samadi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mehdi Samadi'}, {u'AuId': 2407474466, u'AfN': u'indian institute of science', u'DAfN': u'Indian Institute of Science', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'partha pratim talukdar', u'AfId': 59270414, u'DAuN': u'Partha Pratim Talukdar'}, {u'AuId': 2108671403, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'manuela m veloso', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Manuela M.

This is a tedious process and the Web search engines address only part of the overall problem, viz., producing only a list of relevant sources. In this paper, we present ClaimEval, a novel and integrated approach which given a set of claims to validate, extracts a set of pro and con arguments from the Web information sources, and jointly estimates credibility of sources and correctness of claims. ClaimEval uses Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), resulting in a flexible and principled framework which makes it easy to state and incorporate different forms of prior-knowledge.

We propose several candidate authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality. Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $C_i\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $\sigma:[n]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses $f(\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where $f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $m=\tilde{\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\sigma$, for a security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $f$ and $\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate), and generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a family of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or remembering $\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \min\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\}$. For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain strong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login to many different accounts.",1913,manuel blum,computer science department,,,,msa_1817409002,msa_1817409002,-20.502,msa,msa_1817409002,03185,"[{u'AuId': 2132903572, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'mehdi samadi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mehdi Samadi'}, {u'AuId': 2108671403, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'manuela m veloso', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Manuela M.

We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on. The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads. For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider related problems of (2) humanly computable ""one-way functions"" and (3) humanly computable ""pseudorandom generators"". The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as opposed to the usual case of inputs

passwords,0,"[u'computable', u'human', u'passwords', u'towards']",2014,"An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them without relying on a fully trusted computer. We propose several candidate authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality. Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $C_i\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $\sigma:[n]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses $f(\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where $f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $m=\tilde{\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\sigma$, for a security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $f$ and $\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate), and generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a family of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or remembering $\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \min\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\}$. For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain strong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login to many different accounts.",1913,manuel blum,computer science department,,,,msa_2518782816,msa_2518782816,-21.111,msa,msa_2518782816,02436,"[{u'AuId': 2110957663, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'richard wang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Richard Wang'}, {u'AuId': 2108671403, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'manuela m veloso', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Manuela M.

However, it is often infeasible to have globally accurate models. Task performance is often hindered by discrepancies between models and the real world, since the true outcome of executing a plan may be significantly worse than the expected outcome used during planning. Furthermore, expectations about the world are often stochastic in robotics, making the discovery of model-world discrepancies non-trivial. We present an execution monitoring framework capable of finding statistically significant discrepancies, determining the situations in which they occur, and making simple corrections to the world model to improve performance. In our approach, plans are initially based on a model of the world that is only as faithful as computational and algorithmic limitations allow. Through experience, the monitor discovers previously unmodeled modes of the world, defined as regions of a feature space in which the experienced outcome of a plan deviates significantly from the predicted outcome. The monitor may then make suggestions to change the model to match the real world more accurately. We demonstrate this approach on the adversarial domain of robot soccer: we monitor pass interception performance of potentially unknown opponents to try to find unforeseen modes of behavior that affect their interception performance.",1461,manuela veloso,machine learning department,59dcba862bdc9e7b0a70291c,wos_cs_580,,,msa_1528650983,-20.745,wos_pm,wos_cs_580,0910,"[{u'AuId': 2103464885, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'edward hsiao', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Edward Hsiao'}, {u'AuId': 2101365550, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'martial hebert', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Martial Hebert'}]","{u'CN': u'acpr', u'CId': 2755243123}",0,,2013-11-01,"{""DN"":""Coherent Occlusion Reasoning for Instance Recognition"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":131,""InvertedIndex"":{""Occlusions"":[0],""are"":[1,8],""common"":[2],""in"":[3,53,109],""real"":[4,54],""world"":[5,55],""scenes"":[6,56],""and"":[7,57,117],""a"":[9,21,100,123],""major"":[10],""obstacle"":[11],""to"":[12,23],""robust"":[13],""object"":[14,119],""detection."":[15],""In"":[16],""this"":[17],""paper,"":[18],""we"":[19],""present"":[20],""method"":[22,105],""coherently"":[24],""reason"":[25],""about"":[26],""occlusions"":[27,67],""on"":[28,122],""many"":[29,64],""types"":[30],""of"":[31,66,71,79,113,126],""detectors."":[32],""Previous"":[33],""approaches"":[34,75],""primarily"":[35],""enforced"":[36],""local"":[37,47],""coherency"":[38,48],""or"":[39],""learned"":[40],""the"":[41,50,111,114],""occlusion"":[42,51,88],""structure"":[43,52],""from"":[44,59],""data."":[45],""However,"":[46],""ignores"":[49],""learning"":[58],""data"":[60],""requires"":[61],""tediously"":[62],""labeling"":[63],""examples"":[65],""for"":[68],""every"":[69,72],""view"":[70],""object."":[73],""Other"":[74],""require"":[76],""binary"":[77],""classifications"":[78],""matching"":[80,102],""scores."":[81],""We"":[82],""address"":[83],""these"":[84],""limitations"":[85],""by"":[86],""formulating"":[87],""reasoning"":[89],""as"":[90],""an"":[91],""efficient"":[92],""search"":[93],""over"":[94],""occluding"":[95,115],""blocks"":[96],""which"":[97],""best"":[98],""explain"":[99],""probabilistic"":[101],""pattern."":[103],""Our"":[104],""demonstrates"":[106],""significant"":[107],""improvement"":[108],""estimating"":[110],""mask"":[112],""region"":[116],""improves"":[118],""instance"":[120],""detection"":[121],""challenging"":[124],""dataset"":[125],""objects"":[127],""under"":[128],""severe"":[129],""occlusions."":[130]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/acpr/acpr2013.html#HsiaoH13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6778270""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2605947""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.213""}],""VFN"":""Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition"",""VSN"":""ACPR"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ACPR.2013.213"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Edward"",""LN"":""Hsiao"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Martial"",""LN"":""Hebert"",""S"":2}],""BV"":""2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'contextual image classification', u'FId': 75294576}, {u'FN': u'computer vision', u'FId': 31972630}, {u'FN': u'pattern recognition', u'FId': 178980831}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",2005282671,,en,3,"[2151103935, 2031489346, 2057175746, 1761390164, 2031454541, 2548197316, 2156222070, 2089181482, 2113201641, 2104671481, 1989684337, 2161567010, 2135931458, 2059412355, 2101199297, 2005489441, 396735907, 1482914963, 2153185908, 2058761328, 2157084238, 2125337569, 2003253251, 1991711375, 2000723188, 2086572812, 2115469106]",coherent occlusion reasoning for instance recognition,0,"[u'coherent', u'instance', u'occlusion', u'reasoning', u'recognition']",2013,"Occlusions are common in real world scenes and are a major obstacle to robust object detection. In this paper, we present a method to coherently reason about occlusions on many types of detectors. Previous approaches primarily enforced local coherency or learned the occlusion structure from data. However, local coherency ignores the occlusion structure in real world scenes and learning from data requires tediously labeling many examples of occlusions for every view of every object. Other approaches require binary classifications of matching scores. We address these limitations by formulating occlusion reasoning as an efficient search over occluding blocks which best explain a probabilistic matching pattern.

We show that by formulating the visual task as a large matrix multiplication problem, something that is possible for a broad set of modern detectors and classifiers, we are able to dramatically reduce the rate of growth of computation as the number of models increases. The approach, based on a bilinear separation model, combines standard matrix factorization with a task dependent term which ensures that the resulting smaller size problem maintains performance on the original task. Experiments show that we are able to maintain, or even exceed, the level of performance compared to the default approach of using all the models directly, in both detection and classification tasks.

The bases and index tensors are highly compressed representations of the approximated affinity tensor, requiring much smaller memory than in previous methods, which store the full affinity tensor. We compute the principal eigenvector of the approximated affinity tensor using the small bases and index tensors without explicitly storing the approximated tensor. To compensate for the loss of matching accuracy by the approximation, we also adopt and incorporate a marginalization scheme that maps a higher order tensor to matrix as well as a one-to-one mapping constraint into the eigenvector computation process. The experimental results show that the proposed method is faster and requires smaller memory than the existing methods with little or no loss of accuracy.",1079,martial hebert,robotics institute,59dc78072bdc9e77bc6c0ce6,pubmed_241,,,msa_2132802911,-19.799,wos_pm,pubmed_241,02304,"[{u'AuId': 2309332944, u'AfN': u'google', u'DAfN': u'Google', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jiyan pan', u'AfId': 1291425158, u'DAuN': u'Jiyan Pan'}, {u'AuId': 2101365550, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'martial hebert', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Martial Hebert'}, {u'AuId': 2140539176, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'takeo kanade', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Takeo Kanade'}]","{u'CN': u'cvpr', u'CId': 1158167855}",2,"{u'CIId': 162221927, u'CIN': u'cvpr 2015'}",2015-06-01,"{""DN"":""Inferring 3D layout of building facades from a single image"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":132,""InvertedIndex"":{""In"":[0],""this"":[1],""paper,"":[2],""we"":[3],""propose"":[4],""a"":[5,17,49,64,69,122],""novel"":[6],""algorithm"":[7,40],""that"":[8,29,103],""infers"":[9],""the"":[10,82,109,112,126,130],""3D"":[11,46,56,118,127],""layout"":[12],""of"":[13,21,51,87,111,125],""building"":[14,43],""facades"":[15,44],""from"":[16,26],""single"":[18],""2D"":[19,116],""image"":[20],""an"":[22],""urban"":[23],""scene."":[24],""Different"":[25],""existing"":[27,99],""methods"":[28],""only"":[30],""yield"":[31],""coarse"":[32],""orientation"":[33,66],""labels"":[34],""or"":[35],""qualitative"":[36],""block"":[37],""approximations,"":[38],""our"":[39,88,91,104],""quantitatively"":[41],""reconstructs"":[42],""in"":[45],""space"":[47],""using"":[48],""set"":[50],""planes"":[52],""mutually"":[53],""related"":[54],""by"":[55,63],""geometric"":[57,89],""constraints."":[58],""Each"":[59],""plane"":[60],""is"":[61,75,93],""characterized"":[62],""continuous"":[65],""vector"":[67],""and"":[68,84,96,117],""depth"":[70],""distribution."":[71],""An"":[72],""optimal"":[73],""solution"":[74],""reached"":[76],""through"":[77],""inter-planar"":[78],""interactions."":[79],""Due"":[80],""to"":[81],""quantitative"":[83],""plane-based"":[85],""nature"":[86],""reasoning,"":[90],""model"":[92],""more"":[94],""expressive"":[95],""informative"":[97],""than"":[98],""approaches."":[100],""Experiments"":[101],""show"":[102],""method"":[105],""compares"":[106],""competitively"":[107],""with"":[108],""state"":[110],""art"":[113],""on"":[114],""both"":[115],""measures,"":[119],""while"":[120],""yielding"":[121],""richer"":[123],""interpretation"":[124],""scene"":[128],""behind"":[129],""image."":[131]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Pan_Inferring_3D_Layout_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cvpr/cvpr2015.html#PanHK15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Pan_Inferring_3D_Layout_2015_CVPR_paper.html""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7298910""}],""VFN"":""Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"",""VSN"":""CVPR"",""DOI"":""10.1109/CVPR.2015.7298910"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Jiyan"",""LN"":""Pan"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Martial"",""LN"":""Hebert"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Takeo"",""LN"":""Kanade"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)"",""BT"":""p""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'geometry', u'FId': 2524010}, {u'FN': u'computer vision', u'FId': 31972630}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",1898645800,,en,3,"[2146352414, 2132947399, 2125310925, 2536208356, 2158211626, 2116851763, 1486646730, 2341687096, 2145567954, 2026203852, 1581592866, 2032293070, 2080920426, 2074254947, 2151698683, 2018299767, 2160975105, 2092399515, 2113107168, 2068397385, 2398757277, 2129938674, 2081657616, 2151237806]",inferring 3d layout of building facades from a single image,0,"[u'3d', u'building', u'facades', u'image', u'inferring', u'layout', u'single']",2015,"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that infers the 3D layout of building facades from a single 2D image of an urban scene. Different from existing methods that only yield coarse orientation labels or qualitative block approximations, our algorithm quantitatively reconstructs building facades in 3D space using a set of planes mutually related by 3D geometric constraints. Each plane is characterized by a continuous orientation vector and a depth distribution. An optimal solution is reached through inter-planar interactions. Due to the quantitative and plane-based nature of our geometric reasoning, our model is more expressive and informative than existing approaches. Experiments show that our method compares competitively with the state of the art on both 2D and 3D measures, while yielding a richer interpretation of the 3D scene behind the image.",865,martial hebert,robotics institute,59dc7eb02bdc9e77bc6d39e0,wos_cs_367,,,msa_1898645800,-19.743,wos_pm,wos_cs_367,04349,"[{u'AuId': 2552450797, u'AfN': u'french institute for research in computer science and automation', u'DAfN': u'French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'matthew trager', u'AfId': 1326498283, u'DAuN': u'Matthew Trager'}, {u'AuId': 2101365550, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'martial hebert', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Martial Hebert'}, {u'AuId': 2138495596, u'AfN': u'ecole normale superieure', u'DAfN': u'\xc9cole Normale Sup\xe9rieure', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'jean ponce', u'AfId': 29607241, u'DAuN': u'Jean Ponce'}]","{u'CN': u'iccv', u'CId': 1164975091}",4,"{u'CIId': 656565671, u'CIN': u'iccv 2015'}",2015-12-01,"{""DN"":""The Joint Image Handbook"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":105,""InvertedIndex"":{""Given"":[0],""multiple"":[1],""perspective"":[2],""photographs,"":[3],""point"":[4],""correspondences"":[5],""form"":[6],""the"":[7,44,50],""\""joint"":[8],""image\"","":[9],""effectively"":[10],""a"":[11,86,98],""replica"":[12],""of"":[13,49],""three"":[14],""dimensional"":[15],""space"":[16],""distributed"":[17],""across"":[18],""its"":[19],""two-dimensional"":[20],""projections."":[21],""This"":[22],""set"":[23],""can"":[24],""be"":[25],""characterized"":[26],""by"":[27],""multilinear"":[28],""equations"":[29],""over"":[30],""image"":[31,73],""coordinates,"":[32],""such"":[33,57],""as"":[34,58,97],""epipolar"":[35],""and"":[36,46,53,61],""trifocal"":[37],""constraints."":[38],""We"":[39],""revisit"":[40],""in"":[41,79,85,91],""this"":[42,80],""paper"":[43,81],""geometric"":[45],""algebraic"":[47],""properties"":[48],""joint"":[51],""image,"":[52],""address"":[54],""fundamental"":[55],""questions"":[56,84],""how"":[59],""many"":[60],""which"":[62],""multilinearities"":[63,102],""are"":[64,93],""necessary"":[65],""and/or"":[66,72],""sufficient"":[67],""to"":[68,95],""determine"":[69],""camera"":[70],""geometry"":[71],""correspondences."":[74],""The"":[75],""new"":[76],""theoretical"":[77],""results"":[78],""answer"":[82],""these"":[83],""very"":[87],""general"":[88],""setting"":[89],""and,"":[90],""turn,"":[92],""intended"":[94],""serve"":[96],""\""handbook\"""":[99],""reference"":[100],""about"":[101],""for"":[103],""practitioners."":[104]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Trager_The_Joint_Image_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.110""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01249171/document""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iccv/iccv2015.html#TragerHP15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/html/Trager_The_Joint_Image_ICCV_2015_paper.html""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410467/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2919718""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.110""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01249171""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Computer Vision"",""VSN"":""ICCV"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ICCV.2015.110"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Matthew"",""LN"":""Trager"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Martial"",""LN"":""Hebert"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Jean"",""LN"":""Ponce"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)"",""BT"":""p""}",4,"[{u'FN': u'fundamental matrix', u'FId': 147946207}, {u'FN': u'epipolar geometry', u'FId': 23379248}, {u'FN': u'geometry', u'FId': 2524010}, {u'FN': u'topology', u'FId': 126794175}, {u'FN': u'computer vision', u'FId': 31972630}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",2197209490,,en@@@fr,3,"[2033819227, 1518341038, 2018539407, 2170625182, 2124706092, 1485855073, 2142270940, 2162319917, 2134923139, 2069201720, 2112994534, 2005531687, 2045181334, 1581230065, 2122003526, 1995481608, 2139834426, 2075560610]",the joint image handbook,0,"[u'handbook', u'image', u'joint']",2015,"Given multiple perspective photographs, point correspondences form the ""joint image"", effectively a replica of three dimensional space distributed across its two-dimensional projections.

In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.",1566,matthew fredrikson,computer science

latency. The idea is to replicate a request so that it joins the queue at multiple servers. The request is considered complete as soon as any one copy of the request completes. Redundancy is beneficial because it allows us to overcome server-side variability – the fact that the server we choose might be temporarily slow due to factors such as background load, network interrupts, and garbage collection. When there is significant server-side variability, replicating requests can greatly reduce response times. In the past few years, queueing theorists have begun to study redundancy, first via approximations, and, more recently, via exact analysis. Unfortunately, for analytical tractability, most existing theoretical analysis has assumed an Independent Runtimes (IR) model, wherein the replicas of a job each experience independent runtimes (service times) at different servers. The IR model is unrealistic and has led to theoretical results which can be at odds with computer systems implementation results. This paper introduces a much more realistic model of redundancy. Our model allows us to decouple the inherent job size (X) from the server-side slowdown (S), where we track both S and X for each job. Analysis within the S&X model is, of course, much more difficult. Nevertheless, we design a policy, Redundant-to-Idle-Queue (RIQ) which is both analytically tractable within the S&X model and has provably excellent performance.",1523,mor harchol-balter,computer science department,,,,msa_2560441213,msa_2560441213,-20.644,msa,msa_2560441213,039,"[{u'AuId': 2101141533, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'mor harcholbalter', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mor Harchol-Balter'}]","{u'CN': u'sigmetrics', u'CId': 1131589359}",0,,2016-06-14,"{""DN"":""A Better Model for Task Assignment in Server Farms: How Replication can Help"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":182,""InvertedIndex"":{""An"":[0],""age-old"":[1],""problem"":[2],""in"":[3],""the"":[4,10,13,19,55,58,85,99,107,133,139],""design"":[5],""of"":[6,12,77,117,180],""server"":[7,59],""farms"":[8],""is"":[9,18,101,145,171],""choice"":[11],""task"":[14,165],""assignment"":[15,45,166],""policy."":[16],""This"":[17,144],""algorithm"":[20,87],""that"":[21,57,70,88],""determines"":[22],""how"":[23],""to"":[24,28,92,173],""assign"":[25],""incoming"":[26],""jobs"":[27,78],""servers."":[29],""Popular"":[30],""policies"":[31],""include"":[32],""Round-Robin"":[33],""assignment,"":[34],""Join-the-Shortest-Queue,"":[35],""Join-Queue-with-Least-Work,"":[36],""and"":[37,65,138,161],""so"":[38],""on."":[39],""While"":[40],""much"":[41,125],""research"":[42],""has"":[43,48],""studied"":[44],""policies,"":[46],""little"":[47],""taken"":[49],""into"":[50,142],""account"":[51],""server-side"":[52,72,140],""variability"":[53,73,141],""--"":[54],""fact"":[56],""we"":[60],""choose"":[61],""might"":[62],""be"":[63,80],""temporarily"":[64],""unpredictably"":[66],""slow."":[67],""We"":[68,83,111,121,159],""show"":[69],""when"":[71],""dominates"":[74],""runtime,"":[75],""replication"":[76],""can"":[79],""very"":[81],""beneficial."":[82],""introduce"":[84,123],""Replication-d"":[86],""replicates"":[89],""each"":[90],""arrival"":[91],""d"":[93],""servers"":[94],""chosen"":[95],""at"":[96],""random,"":[97],""where"":[98],""job"":[100,135],""considered"":[102],""\""done\"""":[103],""as"":[104,106],""soon"":[105],""first"":[108],""replica"":[109],""completes."":[110],""provide"":[112],""an"":[113],""exact"":[114],""closed-form"":[115],""analysis"":[116],""Replication-d."":[118],""next"":[122],""a"":[124,146,163],""more"":[126],""general"":[127],""model,"":[128],""one"":[129,156],""which"":[130,152,170],""takes"":[131],""both"":[132],""inherent"":[134],""size"":[136],""distribution"":[137],""account."":[143],""departure"":[147],""from"":[148],""traditional"":[149],""queueing"":[150],""models"":[151],""only"":[153],""allow"":[154],""for"":[155],""\""size\"""":[157],""distribution."":[158],""propose"":[160],""analyze"":[162],""new"":[164],""policy,"":[167],""Replicate-Idle-Queue"":[168],""(RIQ),"":[169],""designed"":[172],""perform"":[174],""well"":[175],""given"":[176],""these"":[177],""dual"":[178],""sources"":[179],""variability."":[181]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2901900&type=pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2964791.2901900""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigmetrics/sigmetrics2016.html#Harchol-Balter16""}],""VFN"":""Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems"",""VSN"":""SIGMETRICS"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2896377.2901900"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Mor"",""LN"":""Harchol-Balter"",""S"":1}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGMETRICS International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Science"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'load balancing', u'FId': 139330139}, {u'FN': u'replication', u'FId': 12590798}, {u'FN': u'queueing theory', u'FId': 22684755}, {u'FN': u'resource allocation', u'FId': 29202148}, {u'FN': u'operating system', u'FId': 111919701}, {u'FN': u'distributed computing', u'FId': 120314980}, {u'FN': u'real time computing', u'FId': 79403827}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2418964453,,en,3,,a better model for task assignment in server farms how replication can help,0,"[u'assignment', u'better', u'farms', u'help', u'model', u'replication', u'server', u'task']",2016,"An age-old problem in the design of server farms is the choice of the task assignment policy. This is the algorithm that determines how to assign incoming jobs to servers. Popular policies include Round-Robin assignment, Join-the-Shortest-Queue, Join-Queue-with-Least-Work, and so on. While much research has studied assignment policies, little has taken into account server-side variability -- the fact that the server we choose might be temporarily and unpredictably slow. We show that when server-side variability dominates runtime, replication of jobs can be very beneficial. We introduce the Replication-d algorithm that replicates each arrival to d servers chosen at random, where the job is considered ""done"" as soon as the first replica completes. We provide an exact closed-form analysis of Replication-d.   We next introduce a much more general model, one which takes both the inherent job size distribution and the server-side variability into account. This is a departure from traditional queueing models which only allow for one ""size"" distribution.

Setup costs take the form of a time delay, and sometimes there is additionally a power penalty, as in the case of data centers. While the M/M/1/setup was exactly analyzed in 1964, no exact analysis exists to date for the M/M/k/setup with $$k>1$$ k > 1 . In this paper, we provide the first exact, closed-form analysis for the M/M/k/setup and some of its important variants including systems in which idle servers delay for a period of time before turning off or can be put to sleep. Our analysis is made possible by a new way of combining renewal reward theory and recursive techniques to solve Markov chains with a repeating structure. Our renewal-based approach uses ideas from renewal reward theory and busy period analysis to obtain closed-form expressions for metrics of interest such as the transform of time in system and the transform of power consumed by the system. The simplicity, intuitiveness, and versatility of our renewal-based approach makes it useful for analyzing Markov chains far beyond the M/M/k/setup. In general, our renewal-based approach should be used to reduce the analysis of any 2-dimensional Markov chain which is infinite in at most one dimension and repeating to the problem of solving a system of polynomial equations.

One example is server-side scheduling for video service, where clients request flows of content from a server with limited capacity, and any content not delivered by its deadline is lost. We consider the simultaneous goals of 1) minimizing overall loss, and 2) differentiating loss fractions across classes of flows in proportion to relative weights. State-of-the-art policies, like Discriminatory Processor Sharing and Weighted Fair Queueing, use a fixed static proportional allocation of service rate and fail to achieve both goals. The well-known Earliest Deadline First policy minimizes overall loss, but fails to provide proportional loss across flows, because it treats packets as independent jobs. This paper introduces the Earliest Progressive Deadline First (EPDF) class of policies. We prove that all policies in this broad class minimize overall loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many EPDF policies accurately differentiate loss fractions in proportion to class weights, satisfying the second goal.",1152,mor harchol-balter,computer science department,59dcbada2bdc9e7b0a7038db,wos_cs_601,,,msa_1512282926,-20.727,wos_pm,wos_cs_601,03414,"[{u'AuId': 2102596055, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'timothy zhu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Timothy Zhu'}, {u'AuId': 2167258035, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'alexey tumanov', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alexey Tumanov'}, {u'AuId': 233721872, u'AfN': u'intel', u'DAfN': u'Intel', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'michael a kozuch', u'AfId': 1343180700, u'DAuN': u'Michael A.

The challenges are exacerbated by burstiness in the workloads. This paper describes PriorityMeister -- a system that employs a combination of per-workload priorities and rate limits to provide tail latency QoS for shared networked storage, even with bursty workloads. PriorityMeister automatically and proactively configures workload priorities and rate limits across multiple stages (e.g., a shared storage stage followed by a shared network stage) to meet end-to-end tail latency SLOs. In real system experiments and under production trace workloads, PriorityMeister outperforms most recent reactive request scheduling approaches, with more workloads satisfying latency SLOs at higher latency percentiles. PriorityMeister is also robust to mis-estimation of underlying storage device performance and contains the effect of misbehaving workloads.",985,mor harchol-balter,computer science

to run on one server than another due to server-dependent factors – isan increasingly important concern in many queueing systems. One strategy for overcoming server-side variability to achieve low response time is  redundancy , under which jobs create copies of themselves and send these copies to multiple different servers, waiting for only one copy to complete service. Most of the existing theoretical work on redundancy has focused on developing bounds, approximations, and exact analysis to study the response time gains offered by redundancy. However, response time is not the only important metric in redundancy systems: in addition to providing low overall response time, the system should also be  fair  in the sense that no job class should have a worse mean response time in the system with redundancy than it did in the system before redundancy is allowed.  In this paper we use  scheduling  to address the simultaneous goals of (1) achieving low response time and (2) maintaining fairness across job classes. We develop new exact analysis for per-class response time under First-Come First-Served (FCFS) scheduling for a general type of system structure; our analysis shows that FCFS can be unfair in that it can hurt non-redundant jobs. We then introduce the Least Redundant First (LRF) scheduling policy, which we prove is optimal with respect to overall system response time, but which can be unfair in that it can hurt the jobs that become redundant. Finally, we introduce the Primaries First (PF) scheduling policy, which is provably fair and also achieves excellent overall mean response time.",1693,mor harchol-balter,computer science department,,,,msa_2736908928,msa_2736908928,-20.693,msa,msa_2736908928,03963,"[{u'AuId': 2102596055, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'timothy zhu', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Timothy Zhu'}, {u'AuId': 2141953251, u'AfN': u'kaiserslautern university of technology', u'DAfN': u'Kaiserslautern University of Technology', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'daniel s berger', u'AfId': 153267046, u'DAuN': u'Daniel S.

One primary challenge is determining limits on the multi-tenancy such that SLOs are met. Doing so involves estimating latency, which is difficult, especially when tenants exhibit bursty behavior as is common in production environments. Nevertheless, recent papers in the past two years (Silo, QJump, and PriorityMeister) show techniques for calculating latency based on a branch of mathematical modeling called Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC). The DNC theory is designed for adversarial worst-case conditions, which is sometimes necessary, but is often overly conservative. Typical tenants do not require strict worst-case guarantees, but are only looking for SLOs at lower percentiles (e.g., 99th, 99.9th).   This paper describes SNC-Meister, a new admission control system for tail latency SLOs. SNC-Meister improves upon the state-of-the-art DNC-based systems by using a new theory, Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC), which is designed for tail latency percentiles. Focusing on tail latency percentiles, rather than the adversarial worst-case DNC latency, allows SNC-Meister to pack together many more tenants: in experiments with production traces, SNC-Meister supports 75% more tenants than the state-of-the-art.",1335,mor harchol-balter,computer science department,,,,msa_2521712525,msa_2521712525,-21.584,msa,msa_2521712525,04369,"[{u'AuId': 2049485335, u'AfN': u'microsoft', u'DAfN': u'Microsoft', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'christian borgs', u'AfId': 1290206253, u'DAuN': u'Christian Borgs'}, {u'AuId': 2021736417, u'AfN': u'microsoft', u'DAfN': u'Microsoft', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'jennifer t chayes', u'AfId': 1290206253, u'DAuN': u'Jennifer T.

It is known that in this setting both revenue and social welfare can be maximized by a threshold policy, whereby customers are barred from entry once the queue length reaches a certain threshold. However, no explicit expression for this threshold has been found. This paper presents the first derivation of the optimal threshold in closed form, and a surprisingly simple formula for the (maximum) revenue under this optimal threshold. Utilizing properties of the Lambert W function, we also provide explicit scaling results of the optimal threshold as the customer valuation grows. Finally, we present a generalization of our results, allowing for settings with multiple servers.",917,mor harchol-balter,computer science department,,,,msa_2036433011,msa_2036433011,-21.087,msa,msa_2036433011,04380,"[{u'AuId': 2480438676, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'kristen gardner', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Kristen Gardner'}, {u'AuId': 1633341443, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'samuel zbarsky', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Samuel Zbarsky'}, {u'AuId': 2101141533, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'mor harcholbalter', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Mor Harchol-Balter'}, {u'AuId': 2578014099, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'alan schellerwolf', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Alan Scheller-Wolf'}]","{u'CN': u'sigmetrics', u'CId': 1131589359}",5,,2016-06-14,"{""DN"":""The Power of d Choices for Redundancy"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":143,""InvertedIndex"":{""An"":[0],""increasingly"":[1],""prevalent"":[2],""technique"":[3],""for"":[4,111,130],""improving"":[5],""response"":[6,68,113,134],""time"":[7,69,114,135],""in"":[8,70,91,115],""queueing"":[9],""systems"":[10,71,117],""is"":[11,29,46],""the"":[12,27,39,44,88,107,131,137],""use"":[13],""of"":[14,58,86,122,133,139],""redundancy."":[15],""In"":[16],""a"":[17,83],""system"":[18,28],""with"":[19,118],""redundant"":[20,96],""requests,"":[21],""each"":[22,93],""job"":[23,45,94],""that"":[24,63],""arrives"":[25],""to"":[26,33,77,98],""copied"":[30],""and"":[31,49],""dispatched"":[32],""multiple"":[34],""servers."":[35,123],""As"":[36],""soon"":[37],""as"":[38,136],""first"":[40,108],""copy"":[41],""completes"":[42],""service,"":[43],""considered"":[47],""complete,"":[48],""all"":[50],""remaining"":[51],""copies"":[52,97],""are"":[53],""deleted."":[54],""A"":[55],""great"":[56],""deal"":[57],""empirical"":[59],""work"":[60],""has"":[61],""demonstrated"":[62],""redundancy"":[64],""can"":[65],""significantly"":[66],""reduce"":[67],""ranging"":[72],""from"":[73],""Google's"":[74],""BigTable"":[75],""service"":[76],""kidney"":[78],""transplant"":[79],""waitlists."":[80],""We"":[81,105,124],""propose"":[82],""theoretical"":[84],""model"":[85],""redundancy,"":[87],""Redundancy-d"":[89,116],""system,"":[90],""which"":[92],""sends"":[95],""d"":[99],""servers"":[100,140],""chosen"":[101],""uniformly"":[102],""at"":[103],""random."":[104],""derive"":[106],""exact"":[109,128],""expressions"":[110,129],""mean"":[112],""any"":[119],""finite"":[120],""number"":[121,138],""also"":[125],""find"":[126],""asymptotically"":[127],""distribution"":[132],""approaches"":[141],""infinity."":[142]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2964791.2901497""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigmetrics/sigmetrics2016.html#GardnerZHS16""}],""VFN"":""Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems"",""VSN"":""SIGMETRICS"",""DOI"":""10.1145/2896377.2901497"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Kristen"",""LN"":""Gardner"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Samuel"",""LN"":""Zbarsky"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Mor"",""LN"":""Harchol-Balter"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Alan"",""LN"":""Scheller-Wolf"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGMETRICS International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Science"",""BT"":""p""}",5,"[{u'FN': u'redundancy', u'FId': 83702630}, {u'FN': u'dual modular redundancy', u'FId': 106091288}, {u'FN': u'triple modular redundancy', u'FId': 196371267}, {u'FN': u'redundancy', u'FId': 152124472}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'operating system', u'FId': 111919701}, {u'FN': u'distributed computing', u'FId': 120314980}, {u'FN': u'real time computing', u'FId': 79403827}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2414584249,,en,3,"[1983964956, 1970119220]",the power of d choices for redundancy,0,"[u'choices', u'd', u'power', u'redundancy']",2016,"An increasingly prevalent technique for improving response time in queueing systems is the use of redundancy.

Server farms are typically modeled by a front-end router that employs a dispatching policy to route jobs to one of several servers, with each server scheduling all the jobs in its queue via Processor-Sharing. However, the common assumption has been that all jobs are equally important or valuable, in that they are equally sensitive to delay. Our work departs from this assumption: we model each arrival as having a randomly distributed value parameter, independent of the arrival’s service requirement (job size). Given such value heterogeneity, the correct metric is no longer the minimization or response time, but rather, the minimization of value-weighted response time. In this context, we ask “what is a good dispatching policy to minimize the value-weighted response time metric?” We propose a number of new dispatching policies that are motivated by the goal of minimizing the value-weighted response time.

The peculiar characteristics of cryptomarket research, which often involves encryption, illegal activity, large-scale data collection, and geographical separation from research participants, challenge conventional ethical frameworks. A further complicating factor for reaching ethical consensus is the confluence of scholars drawn from a variety of academic disciplines, each with their own particular norms, practices and perspectives.  This paper is intended to stimulate awareness and debate, and to prompt further reflection amongst scholars studying these fascinating online phenomena. The paper explores tensions and addresses some of the more prominent and pressing ethical questions, including public vs. private online spaces, anonymity, data sharing and ownership, risks and threats to research subjects and researchers.

Multivariate generalizations of the Poisson distribution that permit dependencies, however, have been far less popular. Yet, real-world high-dimensional count-valued data found in word counts, genomics, and crime statistics, for example, exhibit rich dependencies, and motivate the need for multivariate distributions that can appropriately model this data. We review multivariate distributions derived from the univariate Poisson, categorizing these models into three main classes: 1) where the marginal distributions are Poisson, 2) where the joint distribution is a mixture of independent multivariate Poisson distributions, and 3) where the node-conditional distributions are derived from the Poisson. We discuss the development of multiple instances of these classes and compare the models in terms of interpretability and theory.

In this work, we present a latent variable autoregression model that tracks patient weight and blood pressure over time, allowing us to predict weight values into the future. We are also able to model continuous heart-rate signals and evaluate a subject's response to physical activity.

Research has shown that understanding conversational structure between students is paramount to evaluating the productivity of the collaboration and estimating outcomes. However, previous methods often rely on human supplied dialogue act labels or discourse parsing algorithms requiring large labeled datasets. Our method, which utilizes a fast, exact optimization process known as spectral optimization, does not require manually annotated training data and is highly scalable and generalizable.

We describe an approach to synchronization across media that takes into account latency due to communication delays and audio buffering. We also address the problem of mapping from a conventional score with repeats and other structures to an actual performance, which can involve both “flattening” the score and rearranging it, as is common in popular music.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist, learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size, and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.",1031,roger dannenberg,computer science department,,,,msa_2575455538,msa_2575455538,-20.641,msa,msa_2575455538,01795,"[{u'AuId': 2133244830, u'AfN': u'maynooth university', u'DAfN': u'Maynooth University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'steven yi', u'AfId': 157286207, u'DAuN': u'Steven Yi'}, {u'AuId': 2088094625, u'AfN': u'maynooth university', u'DAfN': u'Maynooth University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'victor lazzarini', u'AfId': 157286207, u'DAuN': u'Victor Lazzarini'}, {u'AuId': 128335373, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'roger b dannenberg', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Roger B.

Motivated by object recognition literature and recent work on rapidly estimating linear classifiers, we treat semantic correspondence as a constrained detection problem, where an exemplar LDA classifier is learned for each pixel. LDA classifiers have two distinct benefits: (i) they exhibit higher average precision than similarity metrics typically used in correspondence problems, and (ii) unlike exemplar SVM, can output globally interpretable posterior probabilities without calibration, whilst also being significantly faster to train. We pose the correspondence problem as a graphical model, where the unary potentials are computed via convolution with the set of exemplar classifiers, and the joint potentials enforce smoothly varying

The canonical strategy of using Hard Negative Mining to train a Support Vector Machine is slow, since the large negative set must be traversed at least once per detector. Recent work has demonstrated that, with an assumption of signal stationarity, Linear Discriminant Analysis is able to learn comparable detectors without ever revisiting the negative set. Even with this insight, the time to learn a detector can still be on the order of minutes. Correlation filters,on the other hand, can produce a detector in under a second. However, this involves the unnatural assumption that the statistics are periodic, and requires the negative set to be re-sampled per detector size. These two methods differ chie y in the structure which they impose on the co-variance matrix of all examples.

Time Series Kernels Time series kernels have been gaining in popularity recently for temporal classiﬁcation and event detection [3], [4]. Recently, Lo˝rincz et al.

L is the number of support vectors, M is the length of the input sequence, N is the average length of the support vector sequences and D is the dimensionality of the sequences. Some work [3] has explored strategies for making these methods more efﬁcient such as the employment of constrained DTWs [13], which consider a smaller set of possible causal alignments. Even with these speed ups, "",""ion 11 is relative to Xand Y. It is difﬁcult to ascertain what P x or P y should be without knowing a priori what sequence or sequences you are aligning against. B.

We argue that linear detection functions should be preferred in this regard due to their scalability and efficiency during estimation and evaluation. A popular approach in this regard is to represent a sequence using a bag of words (BOW) representation due to its: (i) fixed dimensionality irrespective of the sequence length, and (ii) its ability to compactly model the statistics in the sequence. A drawback to the BOW representation, however, is the intrinsic destruction of the temporal ordering information. In this paper we propose a new representation that leverages the uncertainty in relative temporal alignments between pairs of sequences while not destroying temporal ordering. Our representation, like BOW, is of a fixed dimensionality making it easily integrated with a linear detection function.

The triangulation constraint however is invalid for moving points captured in multiple unsynchronized videos and bundle adjustment is not purposed to estimate the temporal alignment between cameras. In this paper, we present a spatiotemporal bundle adjustment approach that jointly optimizes four coupled sub-problems: estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, triangulating 3D static points, as well as subframe temporal alignment between cameras and estimating 3D trajectories of dynamic points. Key to our joint optimization is the careful integration of physics-based motion priors within the reconstruction pipeline, validated on a large motion capture corpus. We present an end-to-end pipeline that takes multiple uncalibrated and unsynchronized video streams and produces a dynamic reconstruction of the event.

Psychophysical studies showed that depth continuity is a prerequisite for facilitation of Gabor target detection in the context of flanking Gabors, and that, similarly, surface continuity in purely disparity-defined slanted surfaces was strongly enhanced in distributed patch detections as a function of stimulus duration in this dual discrimination task. The unprecedented dips of performance reduction in the component psychometric functions was captured in a computational model based on a novel Leaky Drift Diffusion Theory that we developed for the underlying neural signals, which can serve as an analytic basis for the time course of all neural decision processes. The time course of depth surface perception was studied in a coordinated trio of psychophysical, neurophysiological and functional imaging studies, showing that the perceptual processing of disparity and integration of 3D surface information across depth cues has time courses of several seconds, attesting to complexity of the neural processing hardware. Three complementary computational modeling projects from three collaborating laboratories showed how surface reconstruction could be accomplished across the typically sparse depth information available, and integrated among sparse, incommensurate cue modalities.",1452,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_262595037,msa_262595037,-21.671,msa,msa_262595037,01703,"[{u'AuId': 188821499, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jason m samonds', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jason M.

We tested whether neurons in macaque V1 interact in a similar manner and found that unambiguous binocular disparity stimuli displayed in the surrounding visualfields of disparity-selective V1 neurons indeed modified their responses when either bistable stereoscopic or uniform featureless stimuli were presented within their receptivefield centers. The delayed timing of the response behavior compared with the timing of classical surround suppression and multiple control experiments suggests that these modulations are carried out by slower disparity-specific recurrentconnectionsamongV1neurons.Theseresultsprovideexplicitevidencethatthespatialinteractionsthatarepredicted by cooperative algorithms play an important role in solving the stereo correspondence problem.",1420,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_2295431043,msa_2295431043,-21.523,msa,msa_2295431043,02538,"[{u'AuId': 2297295714, u'AfN': u'shanghai jiao tong university', u'DAfN': u'Shanghai Jiao Tong University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xiong li', u'AfId': 183067930, u'DAuN': u'Xiong Li'}, {u'AuId': 2714091637, u'AfN': u'shanghai jiao tong university', u'DAfN': u'Shanghai Jiao Tong University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'bin wang', u'AfId': 183067930, u'DAuN': u'Bin Wang'}, {u'AuId': 2127547127, u'AfN': u'shanghai jiao tong university', u'DAfN': u'Shanghai Jiao Tong University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'yuncai liu', u'AfId': 183067930, u'DAuN': u'Yuncai Liu'}, {u'AuId': 2126665346, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'tai sing lee', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tai Sing Lee'}]","{u'CN': u'ecml', u'CId': 2755314191}",7,,2013-09-23,"{""DN"":""Learning discriminative sufficient statistics score space for classification"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":170,""InvertedIndex"":{""Generative"":[0],""score"":[1,28,35,40,60,91,106,111,154],""spaces"":[2],""provide"":[3,42],""a"":[4,45,56,85,128],""principled"":[5],""method"":[6,88,163],""to"":[7,24,95],""exploit"":[8],""generative"":[9,31,71,80,129,147],""information,"":[10],""e.g.,"":[11],""data"":[12],""distribution"":[13],""and"":[14,73],""hidden"":[15,138],""variables,"":[16],""in"":[17],""discriminative"":[18,49,86,161],""classifiers."":[19],""The"":[20,33,108],""underlying"":[21],""methodology"":[22],""is"":[23,63,164],""derive"":[25],""measures"":[26],""or"":[27],""functions"":[29],""from"":[30],""models."":[32,81],""derived"":[34],""functions,"":[36],""spanning"":[37],""the"":[38,65,69,77,90,101,105,114,123,153,159],""so-called"":[39],""space,"":[41],""features"":[43],""of"":[44,68,79,110,116,142,152],""fixed"":[46],""dimension"":[47],""for"":[48,89,127],""classification."":[50],""In"":[51],""this"":[52,143],""paper,"":[53],""we"":[54],""propose"":[55,84],""simple"":[57,117],""yet"":[58],""effective"":[59],""space"":[61,92,155],""which"":[62,120],""essentially"":[64,122],""sufficient"":[66],""statistics"":[67],""adopted"":[70],""models"":[72,148],""does"":[74],""not"":[75],""involve"":[76],""parameters"":[78],""We"":[82],""further"":[83],""learning"":[87,118,125,162],""that"":[93,150],""seeks"":[94],""utilize"":[96],""label"":[97],""information"":[98],""by"":[99],""constraining"":[100],""classification"":[102,168],""margin"":[103],""over"":[104,136,145],""space."":[107],""form"":[109],""function"":[112],""allows"":[113],""formulation"":[115],""rules,"":[119],""are"":[121],""same"":[124],""rules"":[126],""model"":[130],""with"":[131,158,166],""an"":[132],""extra"":[133],""posterior"":[134],""imposed"":[135],""its"":[137],""variables."":[139],""Experimental"":[140],""evaluation"":[141],""approach"":[144,156],""two"":[146],""shows"":[149],""performance"":[151],""coupled"":[157],""proposed"":[160],""competitive"":[165],""state-of-the-art"":[167],""methods."":[169]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-40994-3_4.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-40994-3_4.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pkdd/pkdd2013-3.html#LiWLL13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_4""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3120196""},{""Ty"":0,""U"":""http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_4""}],""VFN"":""European conference on Machine Learning"",""VSN"":""ECML"",""DOI"":""10.1007/978-3-642-40994-3_4"",""RP"":[{""Id"":1516111018,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2051185517,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2126152463,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2166473218,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Xiong"",""LN"":""Li"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Bin"",""LN"":""Wang"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Yuncai"",""LN"":""Liu"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Tai Sing"",""LN"":""Lee"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""ECMLPKDD'13 Proceedings of the 2013th European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases -

The underlying methodology is to derive measures or score functions from generative models. The derived score functions, spanning the so-called score space, provide features of a fixed dimension for discriminative classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective score space which is essentially the sufficient statistics of the adopted generative models and does not involve the parameters of generative models. We further propose a discriminative learning method for the score space that seeks to utilize label information by constraining the classification margin over the score space. The form of score function allows the formulation of simple learning rules, which are essentially the same learning rules for a generative model with an extra posterior imposed over its hidden variables. Experimental evaluation of this approach over two generative models shows that performance of the score space approach coupled with the proposed discriminative learning method is competitive with state-of-the-art classification methods.",1209,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_192226707,msa_192226707,-20.813,msa,msa_192226707,02679,"[{u'AuId': 2682174426, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'ming li', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Ming Li'}, {u'AuId': 2679508975, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'fang liu', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Fang Liu'}, {u'AuId': 2591101933, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'hongfei jiang', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Hongfei Jiang'}, {u'AuId': 2126665346, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'tai sing lee', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tai Sing Lee'}, {u'AuId': 2615544120, u'AfN': u'peking university', u'DAfN': u'Peking University', u'S': 5, u'AuN': u'shiming tang', u'AfId': 20231570, u'DAuN': u'Shiming Tang'}]",,1,,2017-01-03,"{""DN"":""Long-Term Two-Photon Imaging in Awake Macaque Monkey"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":147,""InvertedIndex"":{""Summary"":[0],""Successful"":[2],""application"":[3],""of"":[4,20,27,65,101,134,143],""two-photon"":[5,38,63,83,109],""imaging"":[6,39,64,85,110],""with genetic"":[7],""tools"":[8,139],""in"":[9,17,40,74,123],""awake"":[10,41,75,124],""macaque"":[11,42],""monkeys"":[12,76],""will"":[13],""enable"":[14],""fundamental"":[15],""advances"":[16],""our"":[18],""understanding"":[19],""higher"":[21,144],""cognitive"":[22,145],""function"":[23],""at"":[24,116],""the"":[25,56,126,132,141],""level"":[26],""molecular"":[28,138],""and"":[29,50,72,82,137,140],""neuronal"":[30,67,94,114],""circuits."":[31],""Here"":[32],""we"":[33,59],""report"":[34],""techniques"":[35,127],""for"":[36,77],""long-term"":[37],""monkeys."":[43],""Using"":[44],""genetically"":[45],""encoded"":[46],""indicators"":[47],""including"":[48],""GCaMP5"":[49],""GCaMP6s"":[51],""delivered"":[52],""by"":[53],""AAV2/1"":[54],""into"":[55],""visual"":[57],""cortex,"":[58],""demonstrate"":[60],""that"":[61,87],""high-quality"":[62],""large"":[66],""populations"":[68,115],""can"":[69,129],""be"":[70],""achieved"":[71],""maintained"":[73],""months."":[78],""Simultaneous"":[79],""intracellular"":[80],""recording"":[81],""calcium"":[84],""confirm"":[86],""fluorescence"":[88],""activity"":[89,96],""is"":[90],""linearly"":[91],""proportional"":[92],""to"":[93,105,112],""spiking"":[95],""across"":[97],""a"":[98],""wide"":[99],""range"":[100],""firing"":[102],""rates"":[103],""(10 Hz"":[104],""150 Hz)."":[106],""By"":[107],""providing"":[108],""access"":[111],""cortical"":[113],""single-cell"":[117],""or"":[118],""single"":[119],""dendritic"":[120],""spine"":[121],""resolution"":[122],""monkeys,"":[125],""reported"":[128],""help"":[130],""bridge"":[131],""use"":[133],""modern"":[135],""genetic"":[136],""study"":[142],""function."":[146]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30051-X""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731730051X""}],""VFN"":""Neuron"",""V"":93,""I"":5,""DOI"":""10.1016/j.neuron.2017.01.027"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Ming"",""LN"":""Li"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Fang"",""LN"":""Liu"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Hongfei"",""LN"":""Jiang"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Tai Sing"",""LN"":""Lee"",""S"":4},{""FN"":""Shiming"",""LN"":""Tang"",""S"":5}],""BV"":""Neuron"",""BT"":""a""}",1,"[{u'FN': u'anatomy', u'FId': 105702510}, {u'FN': u'pathology', u'FId': 142724271}, {u'FN': u'neuroscience', u'FId': 169760540}, {u'FN': u'biology', u'FId': 86803240}]",2588329693,"{u'JN': u'neuron', u'JId': 45757444}",en,1,"[2061464631, 2147607085, 2171332611, 2117940227, 2080092859, 2046031057, 2074967846, 2080351494, 2164826784, 1997375364, 1972815737, 1973468287, 2047405616, 1526492552, 2117731089, 2122354249, 1860783201, 2025520018, 1716632673, 2156237058, 2004049427, 1967944899, 2068903635, 2272360941, 1987173769, 2147219058, 2240908316, 1543674079, 1989452564, 2216349089, 2109207151, 2473784504, 2481677392]",long term two photon imaging in awake macaque monkey,0,"[u'awake', u'imaging', u'long', u'macaque', u'monkey', u'photon', u'term', u'two']",2017,"Summary  Successful application of two-photon imaging with genetic tools in awake macaque monkeys will enable fundamental advances in our understanding of higher cognitive function at the level of molecular and neuronal circuits.

Using genetically encoded indicators including GCaMP5 and GCaMP6s delivered by AAV2/1 into the visual cortex, we demonstrate that high-quality two-photon imaging of large neuronal populations can be achieved and maintained in awake monkeys for months. Simultaneous intracellular recording and two-photon calcium imaging confirm that fluorescence activity is linearly proportional to neuronal spiking activity across a wide range of firing rates (10 Hz to 150 Hz).

The model learns latent contextual representations by maximizing the predictability of visual events based on local and global contextual information through both top-down and bottom-up processes. In contrast to standard predictive coding models, the prediction error in this model is used to update the contextual representation but does not alter the feedforward input for the next layer, and is thus more consistent with neurophysiological observations. We establish the computational feasibility of this model by demonstrating its ability in several aspects. We show that our model can outperform state-of-art performances of gated Boltzmann machines (GBM) in estimation of contextual information. Our model can also interpolate missing events or predict future events in image sequences while simultaneously estimating contextual information. We show it achieves state-of-art performances in terms of prediction accuracy in a variety of tasks and possesses the ability to interpolate missing frames, a function that is lacking in GBM.",1294,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_1951119168,msa_1951119168,-21.475,msa,msa_1951119168,03611,"[{u'AuId': 188821499, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jason m samonds', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jason M.

energy model, but not all aspects of disparity tuning are fully explained by the model. Such deviations from the disparity energy model provide us with insight into how network interactions may play a role in disparity processing and help to solve the stereo correspondence problem. Here, we propose a neuronal circuit model with recurrent connections that provides a simple account of the observed deviations. The model is based on recurrent connections inferred from neurophysiological observations on spike timing correlations, and is in good accord with existing data on disparity tuning dynamics. We further performed two additional experiments to test predictions of the model. First, we increased the size of stimuli to drive more neurons and provide a stronger recurrent input. Our model predicted sharper disparity tuning for larger stimuli. Second, we displayed anti-correlated stereograms, where dots of opposite luminance polarity are matched between the left- and right-eye images and result in inverted disparity tuning in the disparity energy model. In this case, our model predicted reduced sharpening and strength of inverted disparity tuning. For both experiments, the dynamics of disparity tuning observed from the neurophysiological recordings in macaque V1 matched model simulation predictions. Overall, the results of this study support the notion that, while the disparity energy model provides a primary account of disparity tuning in V1 neurons, neural disparity processing in V1 neurons is refined by recurrent interactions among elements in the neural circuit.",1682,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_2044838418,msa_2044838418,-20.675,msa,msa_2044838418,03640,"[{u'AuId': 2677588287, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yimeng zhang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yimeng Zhang'}, {u'AuId': 2297295714, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'xiong li', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Xiong Li'}, {u'AuId': 188821499, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'jason m samonds', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jason M.

Central to Bayesian inference is the notion of statistical priors. To understand the neural mechanisms of Bayesian inference, we need to understand the neural representation of statistical regularities in the natural environment. In this paper, we investigated empirically how statistical regularities in natural 3D scenes are represented in the functional connectivity of disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex of primates. We applied a Boltzmann machine model to learn from 3D natural scenes, and found that the units in the model exhibited cooperative and competitive interactions, forming a “disparity association field”, analogous to the contour association field. The cooperative and competitive interactions in the disparity association field are consistent with constraints of computational models for stereo matching. In addition, we simulated neurophysiological experiments on the model, and found the results to be consistent with neurophysiological data in terms of the functional connectivity measurements between disparity-tuned neurons in the macaque primary visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that there is a relationship between the functional connectivity observed in the visual cortex and the statistics of natural scenes. They also suggest that the Boltzmann machine can be a viable model for conceptualizing computations in the visual cortex and, as such, can be used to predict neural circuits in the visual cortex from natural scene statistics.",1587,tai-sing lee,computer science department,59dc76312bdc9e77bc6bb96b,pubmed_129,,msa_2212211360,msa_2212211360,-21.1,multiple,pubmed_129,03751,"[{u'AuId': 188821499, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jason m samonds', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jason M.

neuronal tuning sharpness,0,"[u'measurement', u'neuronal', u'sample', u'sharpness', u'skewness', u'statistical', u'tuning']",2014,"We propose using the statistical measurement of the sample skewness of the distribution of mean firing rates of a tuning curve to quantify sharpness of tuning. For some features, like binocular disparity, tuning curves are best described by relatively complex and sometimes diverse functions, making it difficult to quantify sharpness with a single function and parameter. Skewness provides a robust nonparametric measure of tuning curve sharpness that is invariant with respect to the mean and variance of the tuning curve and is straightforward to apply to a wide range of tuning, including simple orientation tuning curves and complex object tuning curves that often cannot even be described parametrically. Because skewness does not depend on a specific model or function of tuning, it is especially appealing to cases of sharpening where recurrent interactions among neurons produce sharper tuning curves that deviate in a complex manner from the feedforward function of tuning. Since tuning curves for all neurons are not typically well described by a single parametric function, this model independence additionally allows skewness to be applied to all recorded neurons, maximizing the statistical power of a set of data.

This observation has motivated the development of approaches that attempt to couple generative and discriminative models together for classification. However, existing approaches typically feed features derived from generative models to discriminative classifiers, and do not refine the generative models or the feature mapping functions based on classification results. In this paper, we propose a coupling mechanism developed under the PAC-Bayes framework that can fine-tune the generative models and the feature mapping functions iteratively to improve the classifier's performance. In our approach, a stochastic feature mapping, which is a function over the random variables of a generative model, is derived to generate feature vectors for a stochastic classifier. We construct a stochastic classifier over the feature mapping and derive the PAC-Bayes generalization bound for the classifier, for both supervised and semi-supervised learning. This allows us to jointly learn the feature mapping and the classifier by minimizing the bound with an EM-like iterative algorithm using labeled and unlabeled data. The resulting framework integrates the learning of the discriminative classifier and the generative model and allows iterative fine-tuning of the generative models, and the feedforward feature mappings based on task performance feedback. Our experiments show, in three distinct applications, this new framework produces a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance.",1649,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_1944936460,msa_1944936460,-20.929,msa,msa_1944936460,04415,"[{u'AuId': 2685890870, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'tai sing lee', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tai Sing Lee'}]",,2,,2015-08-01,"{""DN"":""The Visual System's Internal Model of the World"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":129,""InvertedIndex"":{""The"":[0,42],""Bayesian"":[1,22],""paradigm"":[2],""has"":[3],""provided"":[4],""a"":[5,53,109],""useful"":[6],""conceptual"":[7],""theory"":[8],""for"":[9,108,113],""understanding"":[10],""perceptual"":[11],""computation"":[12],""in"":[13,125],""the"":[14,17,35,47,62,85,115,119,126],""brain."":[15],""While"":[16],""detailed"":[18],""neural"":[19,121],""mechanisms"":[20,124],""of"":[21,61,87,90],""inference"":[23,71],""are"":[24,45],""not"":[25],""fully"":[26],""understood,"":[27],""recent"":[28],""computational"":[29,37],""and"":[30,39,64,83,94,103,123],""neurophysiological"":[31],""works"":[32],""have"":[33],""illuminated"":[34],""underlying"":[36],""principles"":[38],""representational"":[40,88],""architecture."":[41],""fundamental"":[43],""insights"":[44],""that"":[46,65],""visual"":[48,127],""system"":[49],""is"":[50,67],""organized"":[51],""as"":[52],""modular"":[54],""hierarchy"":[55],""to"":[56,100,118],""encode"":[57],""an"":[58],""internal"":[59,75,92,116],""model"":[60],""world,"":[63],""perception"":[66],""realized"":[68],""by"":[69],""statistical"":[70],""based"":[72],""on"":[73],""such"":[74],""model."":[76],""In"":[77],""this"":[78],""paper,"":[79],""we"":[80],""will"":[81,106],""discuss"":[82],""analyze"":[84],""varieties"":[86],""schemes"":[89],""these"":[91],""models"":[93,117],""how"":[95],""they"":[96],""might"":[97],""be"":[98],""used"":[99],""perform"":[101],""learning"":[102],""inference."":[104],""We"":[105],""argue"":[107],""unified"":[110],""theoretical"":[111],""framework"":[112],""relating"":[114],""observed"":[120],""phenomena"":[122],""cortex."":[128]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4638327/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150551/""}],""VFN"":""Proceedings of the IEEE"",""V"":103,""I"":8,""FP"":1359,""LP"":1378,""DOI"":""10.1109/JPROC.2015.2434601"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Tai Sing"",""LN"":""Lee"",""S"":1}],""BV"":""Proceedings of the IEEE"",""BT"":""a""}",2,"[{u'FN': u'visualization', u'FId': 36464697}, {u'FN': u'predictive modelling', u'FId': 45804977}, {u'FN': u'computational model', u'FId': 66024118}, {u'FN': u'cognitive science', u'FId': 188147891}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",1595026169,"{u'JN': u'pieee', u'JId': 68686220}",en,1,"[2163605009, 2121947440, 2100495367, 1849277567, 2020999234, 2145889472, 2165949176, 2103504761, 2148764920, 2149194912, 2140200866, 2098580305, 2104731571, 2112332687, 1588942736, 2124537004, 2125663122, 2133877521, 2119885245, 2162950292, 2085663684, 1547224907, 1538131130, 2073257493, 2100543212, 2026799324, 2170319235, 2162679451, 2115441154, 2010124835, 2101926813, 2075724496, 2146655366, 2136163184, 2118354656, 2177930949, 2570617923, 2323067647, 2142947774, 2137137397, 2139783870, 2099616257, 2116360511, 2134653808, 1610511020, 1821468701, 2150052800, 64652264, 2139295975, 2137761603, 1543794893, 2159110831, 2147990838, 2022231604, 1967465676, 2066877541, 1672439543, 1968367673, 1967950674, 2137105523, 2081356243, 2074551195, 2133861842, 2053120614, 2614183853, 2163290928, 2017040534, 2166405697, 1821057786, 1504499192, 2107098820, 2125240230, 2105406322, 1491926324, 2156423697, 2135968022, 2132630629, 2001531180, 2106884367, 1985162039, 2097927828, 2071607882, 1864699459, 2162152644, 2032723973, 2128221187, 1976186222, 2110194980, 2164009308, 1665717400, 2164921898, 2046384002, 1972660142, 1600790096, 2168544128, 2059718750, 2027542221, 2112324576, 2583334465, 2111096131, 2163376310, 2159086383, 2163153337, 2123098218, 2096742551, 2135958744, 2137645899, 1987167085, 2095241361, 2044838418, 2040500739, 1991888778, 2005929157, 2016189779, 2212211360, 2110890313, 81409850, 1951119168, 1990695497, 2137786693, 2020240285, 2494972172, 2087680243]",the visual system s internal model of the world,0,"[u'internal', u'model', u'system', u'visual', u'world']",2015,"The Bayesian paradigm has provided a useful conceptual theory for understanding perceptual computation in the brain. While the detailed neural mechanisms of Bayesian inference are not fully understood, recent computational and neurophysiological works have illuminated the underlying computational principles and representational architecture. The fundamental insights are that the visual system is organized as a modular hierarchy to encode an internal model of the world, and that perception is realized by statistical inference based on such internal model. In this paper, we will discuss and analyze the varieties of representational schemes of these internal models and how they might be used to perform learning and inference.

The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.",1639,tai-sing lee,computer science department,,,,msa_2604796864,msa_2604796864,-20.313,msa,msa_2604796864,0865,"[{u'AuId': 2224824764, u'AfN': u'chubu university', u'DAfN': u'Chubu University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'yuji yamauchi', u'AfId': 184937672, u'DAuN': u'Yuji Yamauchi'}, {u'AuId': 2140539176, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'takeo kanade', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Takeo Kanade'}, {u'AuId': 207510293, u'AfN': u'chubu university', u'DAfN': u'Chubu University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'hironobu fujiyoshi', u'AfId': 184937672, u'DAuN': u'Hironobu Fujiyoshi'}]","{u'CN': u'acpr', u'CId': 2755243123}",0,,2013-11-01,"{""DN"":""Classifier Introducing Transition Likelihood Model Based on Quantization Residual"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":171,""InvertedIndex"":{""Binary"":[0],""codes"":[1],""that"":[2,43,66,92,112,143],""are"":[3,71],""binarizations"":[4],""of"":[5,47,139,158,168],""features"":[6,34,52,70],""represented"":[7,35],""by"":[8,36],""real"":[9,37],""numbers"":[10,38],""have"":[11],""recently"":[12],""been"":[13,98],""used"":[14],""in"":[15,20,42,84,150],""the"":[16,48,51,90,116,122,128,137,144,155],""object"":[17],""recognition"":[18],""field,"":[19],""order"":[21,85],""to"":[22,30,86,105,115],""achieve"":[23],""reduced"":[24],""memory"":[25,159],""and"":[26,160],""robustness"":[27],""with"":[28],""respect"":[29],""noise."":[31],""However,"":[32],""binarizing"":[33,169],""has"":[39,97],""a"":[40,44,78,93],""problem"":[41],""great"":[45],""deal"":[46],""information"":[49,65],""within"":[50],""drops"":[53,67],""out."":[54],""That"":[55],""is"":[56,64],""why"":[57],""we"":[58,76,141],""focus"":[59],""on"":[60],""quantization"":[61],""residual,"":[62],""which"":[63,96],""out"":[68],""when"":[69],""binarized."":[72],""With"":[73],""this"":[74],""study,"":[75],""introduce"":[77],""transition"":[79,104],""likelihood"":[80],""model"":[81],""into"":[82,88],""classifiers,"":[83],""take"":[87],""consideration"":[89],""possibility"":[91],""binary"":[94,107,118,124,131],""code"":[95,125,132],""observed"":[99,123],""from"":[100,127],""an"":[101,148],""image"":[102],""will"":[103],""another"":[106],""code."":[108],""This"":[109],""enables"":[110,147],""classifications"":[111],""consider"":[113],""transitions"":[114],""desired"":[117,130],""code,"":[119],""even"":[120],""if"":[121],""differs"":[126],""actually"":[129],""for"":[133,165],""some"":[134],""reason."":[135],""From"":[136],""results"":[138],""experiments,"":[140],""confirmed"":[142],""proposed"":[145],""method"":[146],""increase"":[149],""detection"":[151],""performance"":[152],""while"":[153],""maintaining"":[154],""same"":[156],""levels"":[157],""computing"":[161],""costs"":[162],""as"":[163],""those"":[164],""previous"":[166],""methods"":[167],""features."":[170]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/acpr/acpr2013.html#YamauchiKF13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6778324""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.82""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2606070""}],""VFN"":""Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition"",""VSN"":""ACPR"",""DOI"":""10.1109/ACPR.2013.82"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Yuji"",""LN"":""Yamauchi"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Takeo"",""LN"":""Kanade"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Hironobu"",""LN"":""Fujiyoshi"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'binary pattern', u'FId': 144121637}, {u'FN': u'constant weight code', u'FId': 197242373}, {u'FN': u'binary code', u'FId': 63435697}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'pattern recognition', u'FId': 178980831}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",2534408625,,en,3,"[2161969291, 2168356304, 2039051707, 2099355420, 2548197316, 2097324787, 2534262995, 2120907774, 2109770203, 2121102817, 2128714178, 1863635071, 2125628780]",classifier introducing transition likelihood model based on quantization residual,0,"[u'classifier', u'introducing', u'likelihood', u'model', u'quantization', u'residual', u'transition']",2013,"Binary codes that are binarizations of features represented by real numbers have recently been used in the object recognition field, in order to achieve reduced memory and robustness with respect to noise. However, binarizing features represented by real numbers has a problem in that a great deal of the information within the features drops out. That is why we focus on quantization residual, which is information that drops out when features are binarized. With this study, we introduce a transition likelihood model into classifiers, in order to take into consideration the possibility that a binary code which has been observed from an image will transition to another binary code. This enables classifications that consider transitions to the desired binary code, even if the observed binary code differs from the actually desired binary code for some reason. From the results of experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method enables an increase in detection performance while maintaining the same levels of memory and computing costs as those for previous methods of binarizing features.",1099,takeo kanade,robotics institute,59dcbf1a2bdc9e7b0a70d104,wos_cs_813,,,msa_2534408625,-20.123,wos_pm,wos_cs_813,01069,"[{u'AuId': 2697738458, u'S': 1, u'DAuN': u'Shih-En Wei', u'AuN': u'shihen wei'}, {u'AuId': 2018566553, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'varun ramakrishna', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Varun Ramakrishna'}, {u'AuId': 2140539176, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'takeo kanade', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Takeo Kanade'}, {u'AuId': 2146369081, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'yaser sheikh', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yaser Sheikh'}]","{u'CN': u'cvpr', u'CId': 1158167855}",67,"{u'CIId': 2334863869, u'CIN': u'cvpr 2016'}",2016-06-01,"{""DN"":""Convolutional Pose Machines"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":154,""InvertedIndex"":{""Pose"":[0],""Machines"":[1],""provide"":[2],""a"":[3,18,74,118],""sequential"":[4,75],""prediction"":[5,62],""framework"":[6,32],""for"":[7,21,33,41,94,100],""learning"":[8,34,120,134],""rich"":[9],""implicit"":[10],""spatial"":[11,39],""models."":[12],""In"":[13],""this"":[14,50,71],""work"":[15],""we"":[16],""show"":[17],""systematic"":[19],""design"":[20],""how"":[22],""convolutional"":[23,79],""networks"":[24,80],""can"":[25],""be"":[26],""incorporated"":[27],""into"":[28],""the"":[29,42,98,108,133,148],""pose"":[30,45,67],""machine"":[31],""image"":[35],""features"":[36],""and"":[37,131,140,151],""image-dependent"":[38],""models"":[40],""task"":[43],""of"":[44,49,78,111],""estimation."":[46,68],""The"":[47],""contribution"":[48],""paper"":[51],""is"":[52],""to"":[53],""implicitly"":[54],""model"":[55],""long-range"":[56],""dependencies"":[57],""between"":[58],""variables"":[59],""in"":[60],""structured"":[61],""tasks"":[63],""such"":[64],""as"":[65],""articulated"":[66],""We"":[69,136],""achieve"":[70],""by"":[72,116],""designing"":[73],""architecture"":[76],""composed"":[77],""that"":[81,123],""directly"":[82],""operate"":[83],""on"":[84,144],""belief"":[85],""maps"":[86],""from"":[87],""previous"":[88],""stages,"":[89],""producing"":[90],""increasingly"":[91],""refined"":[92],""estimates"":[93],""part"":[95],""locations,"":[96],""without"":[97],""need"":[99],""explicit"":[101],""graphical"":[102],""model-style"":[103],""inference."":[104],""Our"":[105],""approach"":[106],""addresses"":[107],""characteristic"":[109],""difficulty"":[110],""vanishing"":[112],""gradients"":[113,130],""during"":[114],""training"":[115],""providing"":[117],""natural"":[119],""objective"":[121],""function"":[122],""enforces"":[124],""intermediate"":[125],""supervision,"":[126],""thereby"":[127],""replenishing"":[128],""back-propagated"":[129],""conditioning"":[132],""procedure."":[135],""demonstrate"":[137],""state-of-the-art"":[138],""performance"":[139],""outperform"":[141],""competing"":[142],""methods"":[143],""standard"":[145],""benchmarks"":[146],""including"":[147],""MPII,"":[149],""LSP,"":[150],""FLIC"":[152],""datasets."":[153]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Wei_Convolutional_Pose_Machines_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf""},{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.511""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Wei_Convolutional_Pose_Machines_CVPR_2016_paper.html""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cvpr/cvpr2016.html#WeiRKS16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134?context=cs""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://lib-arxiv-008.serverfarm.cornell.edu/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://128.84.21.199/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://fr.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://tw.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://xxx.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://ru.arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134""}],""VFN"":""Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"",""VSN"":""CVPR"",""DOI"":""10.1109/CVPR.2016.511"",""CC"":{""2145108814"":[""limbs instead of joints) can often have discriminative image structure that can be easier to detect and consequently help reason about the location of smaller, harder-to-detect parts.

In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure.

The feature de- sign is applicable to different application domains, and is evaluated on both lung tissue classification in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images and apoptosis detection in time-lapse phase contrast microscopy image sequences.

We present an integrated computational model of reading that incorporates these and additional subprocesses, simultaneously discovering their fMRI signatures. Our model predicts the fMRI activity associated with reading arbitrary text passages, well enough to distinguish which of two story segments is being read with 74% accuracy. This approach is the first to simultaneously track diverse reading subprocesses during complex story processing and predict the detailed neural representation of diverse story features, ranging from visual word properties to the mention of different story characters and different actions they perform. We construct brain representation maps that replicate many results from a wide range of classical studies that focus each on one aspect of language processing and offer new insights on which type of information is processed by different areas involved in language processing. Additionally, this approach is promising for studying individual differences: it can be used to create single subject maps that may potentially be used to measure reading comprehension and diagnose reading disorders.",1320,tom mitchell,machine learning department,59dc773a2bdc9e77bc6be8bc,pubmed_193,,,msa_1992570774,-19.633,wos_pm,pubmed_193,0250,"[{u'AuId': 2308913560, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'jaspreet bhatia', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Jaspreet Bhatia'}, {u'AuId': 1459126764, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'travis d breaux', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Travis D.

Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 15 privacy policies from three domains (shopping, telecommunication and social networks) to identify all instances of information type hyponymy. From this dataset, three semantic and four syntactic categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 26 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies.

Because such informa- tion is sensitive in general, regulators increasingly require mobile- app developers to publish privacy policies that describe what infor- mation is collected. Furthermore, regulators have fined companies when these policies are inconsistent with the actual data practices of mobile apps. To help mobile-app developers check their pri- vacy policies against their apps’ code for consistency, we propose a semi-automated framework that consists of a policy terminology- API method map that links policy phrases to API methods that pro- duce sensitive information, and information flow analysis to detect misalignments. We present an implementation of our framework based on a privacy-policy-phrase ontology and a collection of map- pings from API methods to policy phrases.

significant abstraction is needed to make the problem manageable from a modeling or computational perspective. When this occurs, a procedure is needed to interpret actions of the opponent that fall outside of our abstraction (by mapping them to actions in our abstraction). This is called an action translation mapping. Prior action translation mappings have been based on heuristics without theoretical justification. We show that the prior mappings are highly exploitable and that most of them violate certain natural desiderata. We present a new mapping that satisfies these desiderata and has significantly lower exploitability than the prior mappings. Furthermore, we observe that the cost of this worst-case performance benefit (low exploitability) is not high in practice; our mapping performs competitively with the prior mappings against no-limit Texas Hold'em agents submitted to the 2012 Annual Computer Poker Competition. We also observe several paradoxes that can arise when performing action abstraction and translation; for example, we show that it is possible to improve performance by including suboptimal actions in our abstraction and excluding optimal actions.",1250,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2215989869,msa_2215989869,-20.213,msa,msa_2215989869,0397,"[{u'AuId': 2024572568, u'AfN': u'polytechnic university of milan', u'DAfN': u'Polytechnic University of Milan', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'nicola gatti', u'AfId': 93860229, u'DAuN': u'Nicola Gatti'}, {u'AuId': 2113687163, u'AfN': u'polytechnic university of milan', u'DAfN': u'Polytechnic University of Milan', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'marco rocco', u'AfId': 93860229, u'DAuN': u'Marco Rocco'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'aaai', u'CId': 1184914352}",5,"{u'CIId': 205598550, u'CIN': u'aaai 2013'}",2013-07-14,"{""DN"":""Algorithms for strong Nash equilibrium with more than two agents"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":211,""InvertedIndex"":{""Strong"":[0],""Nash"":[1,52],""equilibrium"":[2,53,74],""(SNE)"":[3],""is"":[4,18,95,141],""an"":[5,19,81,130,161],""appealing"":[6],""solution"":[7,58],""concept"":[8],""when"":[9],""rational"":[10],""agents"":[11,25],""can"":[12,26,180],""form"":[13],""coalitions."":[14],""A"":[15],""strategy"":[16],""profile"":[17],""SNE"":[20,37,47,82,131,154,167],""if"":[21],""no"":[22],""coalition"":[23,134,138],""of"":[24,59,69,107,114,129],""benefit"":[27],""by"":[28,90],""deviating."":[29],""We"":[30,77,146,173],""present"":[31],""the"":[32,56,67,105,126,171,185,191,197],""first"":[33],""general-purpose"":[34],""algorithms"":[35],""for"":[36,93,132,153],""finding"":[38],""in"":[39],""games"":[40],""with"":[41,135],""more"":[42,187],""than"":[43],""two"":[44],""agents."":[45],""An"":[46],""must"":[48],""simultaneously"":[49],""be"":[50,84,181],""a"":[51,97,149,165],""(NE)"":[54],""and"":[55,71,168,194],""optimal"":[57],""multiple"":[60],""non-convex"":[61],""optimization"":[62],""problems."":[63],""This"":[64],""makes"":[65],""even"":[66],""derivation"":[68],""necessary"":[70,98,115,178],""sufficient"":[72,142],""mathematical"":[73],""constraints"":[75],""difficult."":[76],""show"":[78,103,123,174,195],""that"":[79,104,117,124,175,196],""forcing"":[80,125],""to"":[83,87,111,137,163,183,206],""resilient"":[85],""only"":[86,96],""pure-strategy"":[88],""deviations"":[89],""coalitions,"":[91],""unlike"":[92],""NEs,"":[94],""condition"":[99],""here."":[100],""Second,"":[101],""we"":[102,122],""application"":[106],""Karush-Kuhn-Tucker"":[108],""conditions"":[109,116,179,199,209],""leads"":[110],""another"":[112],""set"":[113],""are"":[118],""not"":[119,144],""sufficient."":[120],""Third,"":[121],""Pareto"":[127],""efficiency"":[128],""each"":[133,157],""respect"":[136],""correlated"":[139],""strategies"":[140],""but"":[143],""necessary."":[145],""then"":[147,169],""develop"":[148],""tree"":[150,203],""search"":[151,202],""algorithm"":[152],""finding."":[155],""At"":[156],""node,"":[158],""it"":[159],""calls"":[160],""oracle"":[162,186],""suggest"":[164],""candidate"":[166],""verifies"":[170],""candidate."":[172],""our"":[176],""new"":[177,198],""leveraged"":[182],""make"":[184],""powerful."":[188],""Experiments"":[189],""validate"":[190],""overall"":[192],""approach"":[193],""significantly"":[200],""reduce"":[201],""size"":[204],""compared"":[205],""using"":[207],""NE"":[208],""alone."":[210]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/aaai2013.html#GattiRS13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2891508""}],""VFN"":""National Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""AAAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Nicola"",""LN"":""Gatti"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Marco"",""LN"":""Rocco"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""AAAI'13 Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",5,"[{u'FN': u'mathematical optimization', u'FId': 126255220}]",2402207037,,en,0,"[1528676759, 1964166152, 2140790422, 217831350, 2293386037, 2057913812, 2013815105, 1991799203, 2156523042, 2140489133, 1698757037, 2145141809, 2498246838, 2076641899, 2165506770, 72488771, 2034471979, 2136449917, 2089649903, 2170578593, 1245373309, 1530849851, 2014267214]",algorithms for strong nash equilibrium with more than two agents,0,"[u'agents', u'algorithms', u'equilibrium', u'more', u'nash', u'strong', u'two']",2013,"Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) is an appealing solution concept when rational agents can form coalitions. A strategy profile is an SNE if no coalition of agents can benefit by deviating. We present the first general-purpose algorithms for SNE finding in games with more than two agents. An SNE must simultaneously be a Nash equilibrium (NE) and the optimal solution of multiple non-convex optimization problems. This makes even the derivation of necessary and sufficient mathematical equilibrium constraints difficult. We show that forcing an SNE to be resilient only to pure-strategy deviations by coalitions, unlike for NEs, is only a necessary condition here. Second, we show that the application of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions leads to another set of necessary conditions that are not sufficient. Third, we show that forcing the Pareto efficiency of an SNE for each coalition with respect to coalition correlated strategies is sufficient but not necessary. We then develop a tree search algorithm for SNE finding. At each node, it calls an oracle to suggest a candidate SNE and then verifies the candidate. We show that our new necessary conditions can be leveraged to make the oracle more powerful. Experiments validate the overall approach and show that the new conditions significantly reduce search tree size compared to using NE conditions alone.",1356,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2402207037,msa_2402207037,-20.708,msa,msa_2402207037,0482,"[{u'AuId': 2246063894, u'AfN': u'university of toronto', u'DAfN': u'University of Toronto', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xin sui', u'AfId': 185261750, u'DAuN': u'Xin Sui'}, {u'AuId': 2060802895, u'AfN': u'university of toronto', u'DAfN': u'University of Toronto', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'craig boutilier', u'AfId': 185261750, u'DAuN': u'Craig Boutilier'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas W Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'ijcai', u'CId': 1203999783}",11,,2013-08-03,"{""DN"":""Analysis and optimization of multi-dimensional percentile mechanisms"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":117,""InvertedIndex"":{""We"":[0,31],""consider"":[1],""the"":[2,73,99,105],""mechanism"":[3],""design"":[4],""problem"":[5],""for"":[6,52,58,71],""agents"":[7],""with"":[8],""single-peaked"":[9],""preferences"":[10],""over"":[11,82],""multi-dimensional"":[12],""domains"":[13],""when"":[14],""multiple"":[15],""alternatives"":[16],""can"":[17],""be"":[18],""chosen."":[19],""Facility"":[20],""location"":[21],""and"":[22,47,55,60,93,104],""committee"":[23],""selection"":[24],""are"":[25,45],""classic"":[26],""embodiments"":[27],""of"":[28,35,40,75,101,107],""this"":[29,102],""problem."":[30],""propose"":[32,67],""a"":[33,38,68],""class"":[34],""percentile"":[36],""mechanisms,"":[37,43],""form"":[39],""generalized"":[41],""median"":[42],""that"":[44],""strategy-proof,"":[46],""derive"":[48],""worst-case"":[49,115],""approximation"":[50],""ratios"":[51],""social"":[53,91],""cost"":[54,62,92],""maximum"":[56,94],""load"":[57,95],""L1"":[59],""L2"":[61],""models."":[63],""More"":[64],""importantly,"":[65],""we"":[66],""sample-based"":[69],""framework"":[70],""optimizing"":[72],""choice"":[74],""percentiles"":[76],""relative"":[77],""to"":[78],""any"":[79],""prior"":[80],""distribution"":[81],""preferences,"":[83],""while"":[84],""maintaining"":[85],""strategy-proofness."":[86],""Our"":[87],""empirical"":[88],""investigations,"":[89],""using"":[90],""as"":[96],""objectives,"":[97],""demonstrate"":[98],""viability"":[100],""approach"":[103],""value"":[106],""such"":[108],""optimized"":[109],""mechanisms"":[110,112],""vis-a-vis"":[111],""derived"":[113],""through"":[114],""analysis."":[116]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3769&context=compsci""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://repository.cmu.edu/compsci/2743/""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2540128.2540182""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ijcai/ijcai2013.html#SuiBS13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ijcai.org/Abstract/13/062""}],""VFN"":""International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""IJCAI"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2083397025,""CoC"":9},{""Id"":2014607560,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2108957189,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2129678216,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":1536918079,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":1970301801,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2106615115,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2154843747,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Xin"",""LN"":""Sui"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Craig"",""LN"":""Boutilier"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Tuomas W"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""IJCAI '13 Proceedings of the Twenty-Third international joint conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",11,"[{u'FN': u'econometrics', u'FId': 149782125}, {u'FN': u'mathematical optimization', u'FId': 126255220}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",318376482,,en,0,"[1526250527, 2108957189, 1826494558, 2154843747, 1238745702, 2078040677, 1536918079, 1970301801, 2015007620, 2120100612, 1587517322, 1557860566, 1628709104, 2028680255, 1553067018, 1981122704, 2106615115, 2083397025, 1918562889, 1573259757, 1502514172, 1974895756, 1855878255, 2225794812, 2122793068, 2014607560]",analysis and optimization of multi dimensional percentile mechanisms,0,"[u'dimensional', u'mechanisms', u'multi', u'optimization', u'percentile']",2013,"We consider the mechanism design problem for agents with single-peaked preferences over multi-dimensional domains when multiple alternatives can be chosen.

auctions (CAs) is an important elusive problem. It is unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale. Rather than pursuing the manual approach of attempting to characterize the optimal CA, we introduce a family of CAs and then seek a high-revenue auction within that family. The family is based on bidder weighting and allocation boosting; we coin such CAs virtual valuations combinatorial auctions ( VVCAs ) . VVCAs are the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism executed on virtual valuations that are affine transformations of the bidders’ valuations. The auction family is parameterized by the coefficients in the transformations. The problem of designing a CA is thereby reduced to search in the parameter space of VVCA—or the more general space of affine maximizer auctions .We first construct VVCAs with logarithmic approximation guarantees in canonical special settings: (1) limited supply with additive valuations and (2) unlimited supply.In the main part of the paper, we develop algorithms that design high-revenue CAs for general valuations using samples from the prior distribution over bidders’ valuations. (Priors turn out to be necessary for achieving high revenue.) We prove properties of the problem that guide our design of algorithms. We then introduce a series of algorithms that use economic insights to guide the search and thus reduce the computational complexity. Experiments show that our algorithms create mechanisms that yield significantly higher revenue than the VCG and scale dramatically better than prior automated mechanism design algorithms. The algorithms yielded deterministic mechanisms with the highest known revenues for the settings tested, including the canonical setting with two bidders, two items, and uniform additive valuations.

one of the most important and elusive problems in mechanism design. The optimal design is unknown, and is known to include features that are not acceptable in many applications, such as favoring some bidders over others and randomization. In this paper, we instead study a common revenue-enhancement approach - bundling - in the context of the most commonly studied combinatorial auction mechanism, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. A second challenge in mechanism design for combinatorial auctions is that the prior distribution on each bidder's valuation can be doubly exponential. Such priors do not exist in most applications. Rather, in many applications (such as premium display advertising markets), there is essentially a point prior, which may not be accurate.

However, most solution algorithms require discrete, finite games. In contrast, many real-world domains require modeling with continuous action spaces. This is usually handled by heuristically discretizing the continuous action space without solution quality bounds. In this paper we address this issue. Leveraging recent results on abstraction solution quality, we develop the first framework for providing bounds on solution quality for discretization of continuous action spaces in extensive-form games. For games where the error is Lipschitz-continuous in the distance of a continuous point to its nearest discrete point, we show that a uniform discretization of the space is optimal. When the error is monotonically increasing in distance to nearest discrete point, we develop an integer program for finding the optimal discretization when the error is described by piecewise linear functions. This result can further be used to approximate optimal solutions to general monotonic error functions.

Green and Laffonti¾?[13] proved that one cannot generically achieve both. We consider strategyproof budget-balanced mechanisms that are approximately efficient. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that a strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink agent whose valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative, and she is compensated with the payments made by the other agents. We assume the valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval. This result strengthens Green and Laffont's impossibility result by showing that even in a restricted domain of valuations, there does not exist a mechanism that is strategyproof, budget balanced, and takes every agent's valuation into consideration--a corollary of which is that it cannot be efficient. Using this result, we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof, budget-balanced mechanisms in this domain. The bound shows that the inefficiency asymptotically disappears when the number of agents is large--a result close in spirit to Green and Laffonti¾?[13, Theorem 9.4]. However, our results provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence. Next, we consider minimizing any convex combination of inefficiency and budget imbalance. We show that if the valuations are unrestricted, no deterministic mechanism can do asymptotically better than minimizing inefficiency alone. Finally, we investigate randomized mechanisms and provide improved lower bounds on expected inefficiency. We give a tight lower bound for an interesting class of strategyproof, budget-balanced, randomized mechanisms. We also use an optimization-based approach--in the spirit of automated mechanism design--to provide a lower bound on the minimum achievable inefficiency of any randomized mechanism. Experiments with real data from two applications show that the inefficiency for a simple randomized mechanism is 5---100 times smaller than the worst case.

We consider a modification to this approach where we solve the portion of the game that we have actually reached in real time to a greater degree of accuracy than in the initial computation. We call this approach endgame solving. Theoretically, we show that endgame solving can produce highly exploitable strategies in some games; however, we show that it can guarantee a low exploitability in certain games where the opponent is given sufficient exploitative power within the endgame. Furthermore, despite the lack of a general worst-case guarantee, we describe many benefits of endgame solving. We present an efficient algorithm for performing endgame solving in large imperfect-information games, and present a new variance-reduction technique for evaluating the performance of an agent that uses endgame solving.

The best prior complete algorithm has significantly worse complexity and has, to our knowledge, never been implemented. The main components of our tree-search-based method are a node-selection strategy, an exclusion oracle, and a subdivision scheme. The node-selection strategy determines the next region to be explored---based on the region's size and an estimate of whether the region contains an equilibrium. The exclusion oracle provides a provably correct sufficient condition for there not to exist an equilibrium in the region. The subdivision scheme determines how the region is split if it cannot be excluded. Unlike well-known incomplete methods, our method does not need to proceed locally, which avoids it getting stuck in a local minimum that may be far from any actual equilibrium.

key component in solving extensive-form games of incomplete information. However, lossless abstractions are typically too large to solve, so lossy abstraction is needed. All prior lossy abstraction algorithms for extensive-form games either 1) had no bounds on solution quality or 2) depended on specific equilibrium computation approaches, limited forms of abstraction, and only decreased the number of information sets rather than nodes in the game tree. We introduce a theoretical framework that can be used to give bounds on solution quality for any perfect-recall extensive-form game. The framework uses a new notion for mapping abstract strategies to the original game, and it leverages a new equilibrium refinement for analysis. Using this framework, we develop the first general lossy extensive-form game abstraction method with bounds. Experiments show that it finds a lossless abstraction when one is available and lossy abstractions when smaller abstractions are desired. While our framework can be used for lossy abstraction, it is also a powerful tool for lossless abstraction if we set the bound to zero. Prior abstraction algorithms typically operate level by level in the game tree. We introduce the extensive-form game tree isomorphism and action subset selection problems, both important problems for computing abstractions on a level-by-level basis. We show that the former is graph isomorphism complete, and the latter NP-complete. We also prove that level-by-level abstraction can be too myopic and thus fail to find even obvious lossless abstractions.",1602,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2020820252,msa_2020820252,-20.043,msa,msa_2020820252,01800,"[{u'AuId': 1908944006, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'christian kroer', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Christian Kroer'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]",,8,,2014-09-11,"{""DN"":""Extensive-Form Game Imperfect-Recall Abstractions With Bounds"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":228,""InvertedIndex"":{""Imperfect-recall"":[0],""abstraction"":[1,126,156,172],""has"":[2],""emerged"":[3],""as"":[4],""the"":[5,37,58,72,104,120,132,140,146,153,169,178,188,204,220],""leading"":[6],""paradigm"":[7],""for"":[8,44,65,113,127,186,225],""practical"":[9],""large-scale"":[10],""equilibrium"":[11],""computation"":[12],""in"":[13,52,57,91,103,142,168],""incomplete-information"":[14],""games."":[15],""However,"":[16],""imperfect-recall"":[17,53,78,155],""abstractions"":[18,79],""are"":[19,30,64,176],""poorly"":[20],""understood,"":[21],""and"":[22,47],""only"":[23,73],""weak"":[24],""algorithm-specific"":[25],""guarantees"":[26,43],""on"":[27],""solution"":[28,41,105,159],""quality"":[29,42,106,160,221],""known."":[31],""In"":[32],""this"":[33,196],""paper,"":[34],""we"":[35,201,213],""show"":[36,111,165,202],""first"":[38,154],""general,"":[39],""algorithm-agnostic,"":[40],""Nash"":[45],""equilibria"":[46,50],""approximate"":[48],""self-trembling"":[49],""computed"":[51],""abstractions,"":[54],""when"":[55],""implemented"":[56],""original"":[59],""(perfect-recall)"":[60],""game."":[61],""Our"":[62],""results"":[63,82,216],""a"":[66,124,128,136,166,191,209],""class"":[67,76,170],""of"":[68,77,95,122,131,171,222],""games"":[69,115],""that"":[70,112,116,203],""generalizes"":[71],""previously"":[74],""known"":[75],""where"":[80,139],""any"":[81],""had"":[83],""been"":[84],""obtained."":[85],""Further,"":[86],""our"":[87,143,223],""analysis"":[88],""is"":[89,145,198],""tighter"":[90],""two"":[92],""ways,"":[93],""each"":[94],""which"":[96],""can"":[97],""lead"":[98],""to"":[99,135,152,164,217],""an"":[100],""exponential"":[101],""reduction"":[102,150],""error"":[107],""bound."":[108],""\r\nWe"":[109],""then"":[110],""extensive-form"":[114],""satisfy"":[117],""certain"":[118],""properties,"":[119],""problem"":[121],""computing"":[123],""bound-minimizing"":[125],""single"":[129],""level"":[130],""game"":[133],""reduces"":[134],""clustering"":[137],""problem,"":[138],""increase"":[141],""bound"":[144,224],""distance"":[147],""function."":[148],""This"":[149],""leads"":[151],""algorithm"":[157],""with"":[158],""bounds."":[161],""We"":[162],""proceed"":[163],""divide"":[167],""problems."":[173],""If"":[174],""payoffs"":[175],""at"":[177,181],""same"":[179],""scale"":[180],""all"":[182],""information"":[183],""sets"":[184],""considered"":[185],""abstraction,"":[187],""input"":[189,205],""forms"":[190],""metric"":[192,210],""space."":[193,211],""Conversely,"":[194],""if"":[195],""condition"":[197],""not"":[199,207],""satisfied,"":[200],""does"":[206],""form"":[208],""Finally,"":[212],""use"":[214],""these"":[215],""experimentally"":[218],""investigate"":[219],""single-level"":[226],""abstraction."":[227]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1409.html#KroerS14""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://128.84.21.199/abs/1409.3302v2""}],""VFN"":""arXiv: Computer Science and Game Theory"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2106233414,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2020820252,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2103315867,""CoC"":5},{""Id"":2739393805,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Christian"",""LN"":""Kroer"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":2}],""BV"":""arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.3302"",""BT"":""a""}",8,"[{u'FN': u'mathematical economics', u'FId': 144237770}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'discrete mathematics', u'FId': 118615104}, {u'FN': u'algorithm', u'FId': 11413529}, {u'FN': u'mathematics', u'FId': 33923547}]",189373357,"{u'JN': u'arxiv cs gt', u'JId': 2595104227}",en,0,"[2103315867, 1664963465, 1510092789, 1973264045, 2739393805, 2106975967, 2153816030, 2123018439, 1528107507, 2133311553, 2086312499, 2121513215, 1882484441, 1482508514, 2091358801, 2106233414, 2008393562, 1554808787, 2020820252, 2293220853, 2193259386, 2295608693, 2104402102, 2098897955, 2064720353, 2121328774]",extensive form game imperfect recall abstractions with bounds,0,"[u'abstractions', u'bounds', u'extensive', u'form', u'game', u'imperfect', u'recall']",2014,"Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for practical large-scale equilibrium computation in incomplete-information games. However, imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood, and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known. In this paper, we show the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original (perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions where any results had been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound. We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties, the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is the distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space.

These exchanges are conducted via cycles—where each incompatible patient-donor pair in the cycle both gives and receives a kidney—and chains, which are started by an altruist donor who does not need a kidney in return. Finding the best combination of cycles and chains is hard. The leading algorithms for this optimization problem use either branch and price—a combination of branch and bound and column generation—or constraint generation. We show a correctness error in the leading prior branch-and-price-based approach [Glorie et al. 2014]. We develop a provably correct fix to it, which also necessarily changes the algorithm's complexity, as well as other improvements to the search algorithm. Next, we compare our solver to the leading constraint-generation-based solver and to the best prior correct branch-and-price-based solver. We focus on the setting where chains have a length cap. A cap is desirable in practice since if even one edge in the chain fails, the rest of the chain fails: the cap precludes very long chains that are extremely unlikely to execute and instead causes the solution to have more parallel chains and cycles that are more likely to succeed. We work with the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange, which uses a chain cap. Algorithms from our group autonomously make the transplant plans for that exchange. On that real data and demographically-accurate generated data, our new solver scales significantly better than the prior leading approaches.",1574,tuomas sandholm,computer science

computing a Nash equilibrium in large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. While this problem can be solved in polynomial time, first-order or regret-based methods are usually preferred for large games. Regret-based methods have largely been favored in practice, in spite of their theoretically inferior convergence rates. In this paper we investigate the acceleration of first-order methods both theoretically and experimentally. An important component of many first-order methods is a distance-generating function. Motivated by this, we investigate a specific distance-generating function, namely the dilated entropy function, over treeplexes, which are convex polytopes that encompass the strategy spaces of perfect-recall extensive-form games. We develop significantly stronger bounds on the associated strong convexity parameter. In terms of extensive-form game solving, this improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of O((#information sets ⋅ depth ⋅ M)/(2 depth )) where M is the maximum value of the l 1  norm over the treeplex encoding the strategy spaces. Experimentally, we investigate the performance of three first-order methods (the excessive gap technique, mirror prox, and stochastic mirror prox) and compare their performance to the regret-based algorithms. In order to instantiate stochastic mirror prox, we develop a class of gradient sampling schemes for game trees.

Kidney exchange, an innovation where willing but incompatible patient-donor pairs can exchange organs—via barter cycles and altruist-initiated chains—provides a life-saving alternative. Typically, fielded exchanges act myopically, considering only the current pool of pairs when planning the cycles and chains. Yet kidney exchange is inherently dynamic, with participants arriving and departing. Also, many planned exchange transplants do not go to surgery due to various failures. So, it is important to consider the future when matching.Motivated by our experience running the computational side of a large nationwide kidney exchange, we present FUTURE-MATCH, a framework for learning to match in a general dynamic model. FUTUREMATCH takes as input a high-level objective (e.g., ""maximize graft survival of transplants over time"") decided on by experts, then automatically (i) learns based on data how to make this objective concrete and (ii) learns the ""means"" to accomplish this goal—a task, in our experience, that humans handle poorly. It uses data from all live kidney transplants in the US since 1987 to learn the quality of each possible match; it then learns the potentials of elements of the current input graph offline (e.g., potentials of pairs based on features such as donor and patient blood types), translates these to weights, and performs a computationally feasible batch matching that incorporates dynamic, failure-aware considerations through the weights.We validate FUTUREMATCH on real fielded exchange data. It results in higher values of the objective. Furthermore, even under economically inefficient objectives that enforce equity, it yields better solutions for the efficient objective (which does not incorporate equity) than traditional myopic matching that uses the efficiency objective.",1941,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2293140664,msa_2293140664,-20.309,msa,msa_2293140664,02103,"[{u'AuId': 2499828494, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'benjamin plaut', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Benjamin Plaut'}, {u'AuId': 2125216766, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'john p dickerson', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'John P.

These trades occur via cycles, where each patient-donor pair both gives and receives a kidney, and via chains, which begin with an altruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return. For logistical reasons, the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a small constant, while chains can be much longer. Given a compatibility graph of patient-donor pairs, altruists, and feasible potential transplants between them, finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles and chains is NP-hard. There has been much work on developing provably optimal solvers that are efficient in practice. One of the leading techniques has been branch and price, where column generation is used to incrementally bring cycles and chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis. In particular, only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model. We prove that finding a positive-price chain is NP-complete.

equilibrium-finding algorithm. We introduce a distributed version of the most commonly used equilibrium-finding algorithm, counterfactual regret minimization (CFR), which enables CFR to scale to dramatically larger abstractions and numbers of cores. The new algorithm begets constraints on the abstraction so as to make the pieces running on different computers disjoint. We introduce an algorithm for generating such abstractions while capitalizing on state-of-the-art abstraction ideas such as imperfect recall and earth-mover's distance. Our techniques enabled an equilibrium computation of unprecedented size on a supercomputer with a high inter-blade memory latency. Prior approaches run slowly on this architecture. Our approach also leads to a significant improvement over using the prior best approach on a large shared-memory server with low memory latency. Finally, we introduce a family of post-processing techniques that outperform prior ones. We applied these techniques to generate an agent for two-player no-limit Texas Hold'em, called Tartanian7, that won the 2014 Annual Computer Poker Competition, beating each opponent with statistical

u'recall']",2016,"Imperfect-recall abstraction has emerged as the leading paradigm for practical large-scale equilibrium computation in imperfect-information games. However, imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood, and only weak algorithm-specific guarantees on solution quality are known. We develop the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in imperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original (perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions for which any such results have been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error bound.   We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties, the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of the game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is the distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide in the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all information sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space, and this immediately yields a $2$-approximation algorithm for abstraction.

This paper initiates a new direction via two simultaneous deviation points: generalization to imperfect-information games and a game-theoretic approach. The question of how one should act when facing an opponent whose lookahead is limited is studied along multiple axes: lookahead depth, whether the opponent(s), too, have imperfect information, and how they break ties. We characterize the hardness of finding a Nash equilibrium or an optimal commitment strategy for either player, showing that in some of these variations the problem can be solved in polynomial time while in others it is PPAD-hard or NP-hard. We proceed to design algorithms for computing optimal commitment strategies for when the opponent breaks ties 1) favorably, 2) according to a fixed rule, or 3) adversarially. The impact of limited lookahead is then investigated experimentally. The limited-lookahead player often obtains the value of the game if she knows the expected values of nodes in the game tree for some equilibrium, but we prove this is not sufficient in general. Finally, we study the impact of noise in those estimates and different lookahead depths. This uncovers a lookahead pathology.",1253,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_1190832478,msa_1190832478,-20.934,msa,msa_1190832478,02949,"[{u'AuId': 2160528517, u'AfN': u'university

The literature has focused on the case where each bidder has two options: to accept or reject the offered price. However, in many settings--such as the FCC's imminent incentive auction--each bidder may be able to sell one from a set of options. We present a multi-option DCA (MDCA) framework where at each round, the auctioneer offers each bidder different prices for different options, and a bidder may find multiple options still acceptable. Setting prices during a MDCA is trickier than in a DCA. We develop a Markov chain model for the dynamics of each bidder's state (which options are still acceptable). We leverage it to optimize the trajectory of price offers to different bidders for different options. This is unlike most auctions which only compute the next price vector. Computing the trajectory enables better planning. We reoptimize the trajectory after each round. Each optimization minimizes total payment while ensuring feasibility in a stochastic sense. We also introduce percentile-based approaches to decrementing prices.

In this paper, we begin by proposing the idea of liver exchange, and show on demographically accurate data that vetted kidney exchange algorithms can be adapted to clear such an exchange at the nationwide level.  We then explore cross-organ donation where kidneys and livers can be bartered for each other.  We show theoretically that this multi-organ exchange provides linearly more transplants than running separate kidney and liver exchanges; this linear gain is a product of altruistic kidney donors creating chains that thread through the liver pool.  We support this result experimentally on demographically accurate multi-organ exchanges.

characterization of game-theoretic solution concepts is a central topic in artificial intelligence, with the aim of developing computationally efficient tools for finding optimal ways to behave in strategic interactions. The central solution concept in game theory is Nash equilibrium (NE). However, it fails to capture the possibility that agents can form coalitions (even in the 2-agent case). Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) refines NE to this setting. It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number of agents is constant. This hardness is solely due to the existence of mixed-strategy SNEs, given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy SNEs is trivially in P. Our central result is that, in order for a game to have at least one non-pure-strategy SNE, the agents' payoffs restricted to the agents' supports must, in the case of 2 agents, lie on the same line, and, in the case of n agents, lie on an (n - 1)-dimensional hyperplane. Leveraging this result, we provide two contributions. First, we develop worst-case instances for support-enumeration algorithms. These instances have only one SNE and the support size can be chosen to be of any size-in particular, arbitrarily large. Second, we prove that, unlike NE, finding an SNE is in smoothed polynomial time: generic game instances (i.e., all instances except knife-edge cases) have only pure-strategy SNEs.",1408,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_1826503513,msa_1826503513,-21.449,msa,msa_1826503513,03164,"[{u'AuId': 2024572568, u'AfN': u'polytechnic university of milan', u'DAfN': u'Polytechnic University of Milan', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'nicola gatti', u'AfId': 93860229, u'DAuN': u'Nicola Gatti'}, {u'AuId': 2113687163, u'AfN': u'polytechnic university of milan', u'DAfN': u'Polytechnic University of Milan', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'marco rocco', u'AfId': 93860229, u'DAuN': u'Marco Rocco'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'aamas', u'CId': 1168671587}",11,"{u'CIId': 128385434, u'CIN': u'aamas 2013'}",2013-05-06,"{""DN"":""On the verification and computation of strong nash equilibrium"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":101,""InvertedIndex"":{""Computing"":[0],""equilibria"":[1],""of"":[2,14,68],""games"":[3],""is"":[4,41,48,74,81],""a"":[5,71,87],""central"":[6],""task"":[7],""in"":[8,82],""computer"":[9],""science."":[10],""A"":[11],""large"":[12],""number"":[13],""results"":[15,55],""are"":[16,30,56],""known"":[17,57],""for"":[18],""Nash"":[19,50],""equilibrium"":[20,51],""(NE)."":[21],""However,"":[22],""these"":[23],""can"":[24,37],""be"":[25],""adopted"":[26],""only"":[27],""when"":[28],""coalitions"":[29],""not"":[31],""an"":[32,44,75,93],""issue."":[33],""When"":[34],""instead"":[35],""agents"":[36],""form"":[38],""coalitions,"":[39],""NE"":[40],""inadequate"":[42],""and"":[43,95],""appropriate"":[45],""solution"":[46],""concept"":[47],""strong"":[49],""(SNE)."":[52],""Few"":[53],""computational"":[54],""about"":[58],""SNE."":[59],""In"":[60],""this"":[61],""paper,"":[62],""we"":[63,96],""first"":[64],""study"":[65],""the"":[66,79,99],""problem"":[67,80],""verifying"":[69],""whether"":[70],""strategy"":[72],""profile"":[73],""SNE,"":[76,94],""showing"":[77],""that"":[78],""P."":[83],""We"":[84],""then"":[85],""design"":[86],""spatial"":[88],""branch--and--bound"":[89],""algorithm"":[90],""to"":[91],""find"":[92],""experimentally"":[97],""evaluate"":[98],""algorithm."":[100]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2013/docs/p723.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/atal/aamas2013.html#GattiRS13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2485034""}],""VFN"":""Adaptive Agents and Multi-Agents Systems"",""VSN"":""AAMAS"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2013815105,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2034471979,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2076641899,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2165506770,""CoC"":7},{""Id"":2140489133,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":2498246838,""CoC"":6}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Nicola"",""LN"":""Gatti"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Marco"",""LN"":""Rocco"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""adaptive agents and multi-agents systems"",""BT"":""a""}",11,"[{u'FN': u'epsilon equilibrium', u'FId': 141824439}, {u'FN': u'best response', u'FId': 32407928}, {u'FN': u'price of stability', u'FId': 188466206}, {u'FN': u'equilibrium selection', u'FId': 164407509}, {u'FN': u'nash equilibrium', u'FId': 46814582}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'mathematical optimization', u'FId': 126255220}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",72488771,,en,0,"[1528676759, 1574151794, 2093404847, 2140790422, 2057913812, 2013815105, 1991799203, 2156523042, 2140489133, 1698757037, 2145141809, 2498246838, 2125467036, 2076641899, 1519411016, 2098010528, 2136449917, 2402207037, 1769087895, 2089649903, 1518579782, 1826503513, 2014267214]",on the verification and computation of strong nash equilibrium,0,"[u'computation', u'equilibrium', u'nash', u'strong', u'verification']",2013,"Computing equilibria of games is a central task in computer science.

clock auctions,0,"[u'auctions', u'clock', u'descending', u'optimizing', u'prices']",2014,"A descending (multi-item) clock auction (DCA) is a mechanism for buying items from multiple potential sellers. In the DCA, bidder-specific prices are decremented over the course of the auction. In each round, each bidder might accept or decline his offer price. Accepting means the bidder is willing to sell at that price. Rejecting means the bidder will not sell at that price or a lower price. DCAs have been proposed as the method for procuring spectrum from existing holders in the FCC's imminent incentive auctions so spectrum can be repurposed to higher-value uses. However, the DCA design has lacked a way to determine the prices to offer the bidders in each round. This is a recognized, important, and timely problem.   We present, to our knowledge, the first techniques for this. We develop a percentile-based approach which provides a means to naturally reduce the offer prices to the bidders through the bidding rounds. We also develop an optimization model for setting prices so as to minimize expected payment while stochastically satisfying the feasibility constraint. (The DCA has a final adjustment round that obtains feasibility after feasibility has been lost in the final round of the main DCA.) We prove attractive properties of this, such as symmetry and monotonicity. We develop computational methods for solving the model. (We also develop optimization models with recourse, but they are not computationally practical.) We present experiments both on the homogeneous items case and the case of FCC incentive auctions, where we use real interference constraint data to get a fully faithful model of feasibility. An unexpected paradox about DCAs is that sometimes when the number of rounds allowed increases, the final payment increases.

Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.   In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.   Finally, we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account, under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure. Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges. We show how to implement such failure-aware matching in our model, and also extend the state-of-the-art general branch-and-price-based non-compact formulation for the failure-aware problem to run its pricing problem in polynomial time.",2276,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2413930874,msa_2413930874,-20.872,msa,msa_2413930874,03362,"[{u'AuId': 2153142498, u'AfN': u'carnegie

the best algorithms; for example, a popular variant of poker has about 10165 nodes in its game tree, while the currently best approximate equilibrium-finding algorithms scale to games with around 1012 nodes. In order to approximate equilibrium strategies in these games, the leading approach is to create a sufficiently small strategic approximation of the full game, called an abstraction, and to solve that smaller game instead. The leading abstraction algorithm for imperfect-information games generates abstractions that have imperfect recall and are distribution aware, using k-means with the earth mover's distance metric to cluster similar states together. A distribution-aware abstraction groups states together at a given round if their full distributions over future strength are similar (as opposed to, for example, just the expectation of their strength). The leading algorithm considers distributions over future strength at the final round of the game. However, one might benefit by considering the trajectory of distributions over strength in all future rounds, not just the final round. An abstraction algorithm that takes all future rounds into account is called potential aware. We present the first algorithm for computing potential-aware imperfect-recall abstractions using earth mover's distance.

recent development of software-defined radio technology, respectively, provide a low barrier and a wide range of capabilities for misbehavior, attacks, and defenses against attacks. In this work we present finite-energy jamming games, a game model that allows a jammer and sender to choose (1) whether to transmit or sleep, (2) a power level to transmit with, and (3) what channel to transmit on. We also allow the jammer to choose on how many channels it simultaneously attacks. A major addition in finite-energy jamming games is that the jammer and sender both have a limited amount of energy which is drained according to the actions a player takes.   We develop a model of our system as a zero-sum finite-horizon stochastic game with deterministic transitions. We leverage the zero-sum and finite-horizon properties of our model to design a simple polynomial-time algorithm to compute optimal randomized strategies for both players. The utility function of our game model can be decoupled into a recursive equation. Our algorithm exploits this fact to use dynamic programming to construct solutions in a bottom-up fashion. For each state of energy levels, a linear program is solved to find Nash equilibrium strategies for the subgame. With these techniques, our algorithm has only a linear dependence on the number of states, and quadratic dependence on the number of actions, allowing us to solve very large instances.   By computing Nash equilibria for our game models, we explore what kind of performance guarantees can be achieved both for the sender and jammer, when playing against an optimal opponent. We also use the optimal strategies to simulate finite-energy jamming games and provide insights into robust communication among reconfigurable, yet energy-limited, radio systems. To test the performance of the optimal strategies we compare their performance with a random and adaptive strategy. Matching our intuition, the aggressiveness of an attacker is related to how much of a discount is placed on data delay. This results in the defender often choosing to sleep despite the latency implication, because the threat of jamming is high. We also present several other findings from simulations where we vary the strategies for one or both of the players.",2317,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2065483835,msa_2065483835,-20.777,msa,msa_2065483835,03618,"[{u'AuId': 2131951165, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'noam brown', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Noam Brown'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]",,0,,2016-09-12,"{""DN"":""Reduced Space and Faster Convergence in Imperfect-Information Games via Regret-Based Pruning"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":108,""InvertedIndex"":{""Counterfactual"":[0],""Regret"":[1],""Minimization"":[2],""(CFR)"":[3],""is"":[4,18,65],""the"":[5,44,101],""most"":[6],""popular"":[7],""iterative"":[8],""algorithm"":[9],""for"":[10],""solving"":[11],""zero-sum"":[12,57],""imperfect-information"":[13],""games."":[14],""Regret-Based"":[15],""Pruning"":[16],""(RBP)"":[17],""an"":[19,93],""improvement"":[20],""that"":[21,42,55,64,88],""allows"":[22],""poorly-performing"":[23],""actions"":[24,50],""to"":[25,72,78],""be"":[26],""temporarily"":[27],""pruned,"":[28],""thus"":[29],""speeding"":[30],""up"":[31],""CFR."":[32],""We"":[33,53],""introduce"":[34],""Total"":[35,89],""RBP,"":[36],""a"":[37,69],""new"":[38],""form"":[39],""of"":[40,47,68,95],""RBP"":[41,90],""reduces"":[43],""space"":[45,84],""requirements"":[46],""CFR"":[48],""as"":[49],""are"":[51],""pruned."":[52],""prove"":[54],""in"":[56,92,98],""games"":[58],""it"":[59],""asymptotically"":[60],""prunes"":[61],""any"":[62],""action"":[63],""not"":[66],""part"":[67],""best"":[70],""response"":[71],""some"":[73],""Nash"":[74],""equilibrium."":[75],""This"":[76],""leads"":[77],""provably"":[79],""faster"":[80],""convergence"":[81],""and"":[82,100],""lower"":[83],""requirements."":[85],""Experiments"":[86],""show"":[87],""results"":[91],""order"":[94],""magnitude"":[96],""reduction"":[97,102],""space,"":[99],""factor"":[103],""increases"":[104],""with"":[105],""game"":[106],""size."":[107]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1609.html#BrownS16a""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://scirate.com/arxiv/1609.03234""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://uk.arxiv.org/abs/1609.03234""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03234v1""}],""VFN"":""arXiv: Computer Science and Game Theory"",""CC"":{""2562576832"":[""rly iterations, recent work has shown that these early iterations can be skipped by ﬁrst solving a low-memory abstraction of the game and then using its solution to warm starting CFR in the full game [4].

Regret-Based Pruning (RBP) is an improvement that allows poorly-performing actions to be temporarily pruned, thus speeding up CFR. We introduce Total RBP, a new form of RBP that reduces the space requirements of CFR as actions are pruned.

We begin by proving that regrets on actions in one setting (game) can be transferred to warm start the regrets for solving a different setting with same structure but different payoffs that can be written as a function of parameters. We prove how this can be done by carefully discounting the prior regrets. This provides, to our knowledge, the first principled warm-starting method for no-regret learning. It also extends to warm-starting the widely-adopted counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm for large incomplete-information games; we show this experimentally as well. We then study optimizing a parameter vector for a player in a two-player zero-sum game (e.g., optimizing bet sizes to use in poker). We propose a custom gradient descent algorithm that provably finds a locally optimal parameter vector while leveraging our warm-start theory to significantly save regret-matching iterations at each step. It optimizes the parameter vector while simultaneously finding an equilibrium. We present experiments in no-limit Leduc Hold'em and nolimit Texas Hold'em to optimize bet sizing.

In the traditional economic models, it is assumed that the bidders' valuations are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes unrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction class. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in automated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on the underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the auction classes in the hierarchy.

Instead the mechanism designer receives a set of samples from this distribution and his goal is to use the sample to design a pricing mechanism or auction with high expected profit. We provide generalization guarantees which bound the difference between average profit on the sample and expected profit over the distribution. These bounds are directly proportional to the intrinsic complexity of the mechanism class the designer is optimizing over. We present a single, overarching theorem that uses empirical Rademacher complexity to measure the intrinsic complexity of a variety of widely-studied single- and multi-item auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions, mixed-bundling auctions, and second-price item auctions. Despite the extensive applicability of our main theorem, we match and improve over the best-known generalization guarantees for many auction classes. This all-encompassing theorem also applies to multi- and single-item pricing mechanisms in both multi- and single-unit settings, such as linear and non-linear pricing mechanisms. Finally, our central theorem allows us to easily derive generalization guarantees for every class in several finely grained hierarchies of auction and pricing mechanism classes. We demonstrate how to determine the precise level in a hierarchy with the optimal tradeoff between profit and generalization using structural profit maximization. The mechanism classes we study are significantly different from well-understood function classes typically found in machine learning, so bounding their complexity requires a sharp understanding of the interplay between mechanism parameters and buyer valuations.",1797,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2610284463,msa_2610284463,-21.253,msa,msa_2610284463,03765,"[{u'AuId': 2577430943, u'S': 1, u'DAuN': u'Fei Peng', u'AuN': u'fei peng'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'ijcai', u'CId': 1203999783}",0,"{u'CIId': 2321817494, u'CIN': u'ijcai 2016'}",2016-07-09,"{""DN"":""Scalable segment abstraction method for advertising campaign admission and inventory allocation optimization"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":164,""InvertedIndex"":{""As"":[0],""publishers"":[1],""gather"":[2],""more"":[3],""information"":[4,12],""about"":[5],""their"":[6],""users,"":[7],""they"":[8],""can"":[9],""use"":[10,70],""that"":[11,35,64],""to"":[13,16,47,75,125],""enable"":[14],""advertisers"":[15],""create"":[17],""increasingly"":[18],""targeted"":[19],""campaigns."":[20,48,113],""This"":[21],""enables"":[22],""better"":[23,142],""usage"":[24],""of"":[25,93,136,159],""advertising"":[26],""inventory."":[27],""However,"":[28],""it"":[29,89],""also"":[30],""dramatically"":[31],""increases"":[32],""the"":[33,36,76,86],""complexity"":[34],""publisher"":[37],""faces"":[38],""when"":[39],""optimizing"":[40],""campaign"":[41],""admission"":[42],""decisions"":[43],""and"":[44,99,111,148],""inventory"":[45],""allocation"":[46],""We"":[49],""develop"":[50],""an"":[51,133,137],""optimal"":[52,134],""anytime"":[53],""algorithm"":[54,79,130],""for"":[55,69,85,109,131,145],""abstracting"":[56],""fine-grained"":[57],""audience"":[58],""segments"":[59,63],""into"":[60],""coarser"":[61],""abstract"":[62,138],""are"":[65],""not"":[66],""too"":[67],""numerous"":[68],""in"":[71,96,102],""such"":[72],""optimization."":[73],""Compared"":[74],""segment"":[77],""abstraction"":[78,103],""by"":[80],""Walsh"":[81],""et"":[82],""al."":[83],""[2010]"":[84],""same"":[87],""problem,"":[88],""yields"":[90],""two"":[91],""orders"":[92],""magnitude"":[94],""improvement"":[95,101],""run"":[97],""time"":[98,151,162],""significant"":[100],""quality."":[104],""These"":[105],""benefits"":[106],""hold"":[107],""both"":[108],""guaranteed"":[110],""non-guaranteed"":[112],""The"":[114],""performance"":[115],""stems"":[116],""from"":[117],""three"":[118],""improvements:"":[119],""1)"":[120],""a"":[121,141],""quadratic-time"":[122],""(as"":[123],""opposed"":[124],""doubly"":[126],""exponential"":[127],""or"":[128],""heuristic)"":[129],""finding"":[132],""split"":[135],""segment,"":[139],""2)"":[140],""scoring"":[143],""function"":[144],""evaluating"":[146],""splits,"":[147],""3)"":[149],""splitting"":[150],""lossily"":[152],""like"":[153],""any"":[154],""other"":[155],""targeting"":[156],""attribute"":[157],""(instead"":[158],""losslessly"":[160],""segmenting"":[161],""first)."":[163]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ijcai/ijcai2016.html#PengS16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.ijcai.org/Abstract/16/099""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3060713""}],""VFN"":""International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""IJCAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Fei"",""LN"":""Peng"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":2}],""BV"":""IJCAI'16 Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2578907711,,en,0,"[1975392791, 2295628635, 2158268067, 2033798573, 2086561196, 1823541154, 2167264564, 2132716139, 2107131020, 2137619005, 2183373924, 2206071134]",scalable segment abstraction method for advertising campaign admission and inventory allocation optimization,0,"[u'abstraction', u'admission', u'advertising', u'allocation', u'campaign', u'inventory', u'optimization', u'scalable', u'segment']",2016,"As publishers gather more information about their users, they can use that information to enable advertisers to create increasingly targeted campaigns. This enables better usage of advertising inventory. However, it also dramatically increases the complexity that the publisher faces when optimizing campaign admission decisions and inventory allocation to campaigns. We develop an optimal anytime algorithm for abstracting fine-grained audience segments into coarser abstract segments that are not too numerous for use in such optimization. Compared to the segment abstraction algorithm by Walsh et al. [2010] for the same problem, it yields two orders of magnitude improvement in run time and significant improvement in abstraction quality. These benefits hold both for guaranteed and non-guaranteed campaigns. The performance stems from three improvements: 1) a quadratic-time (as opposed to doubly exponential or heuristic) algorithm for finding an optimal split of an abstract segment, 2) a better scoring function for evaluating splits, and 3) splitting time lossily like any other targeting attribute (instead of losslessly segmenting time first).",1154,tuomas sandholm,computer science

In this paper we study steering such adaptation through sequential planning. We propose a general approach where we leverage Monte Carlo tree search to compute a treatment plan, and the biological entity is modeled by a black-box simulator that the planner calls during planning. We show that the framework can be used to steer a biological entity modeled via a complex signaling pathway network that has numerous feedback loops that operate at different rates and have hard-to-understand aggregate behavior. We apply the framework to steering the adaptation of a patient's immune system. In particular, we apply it to a leading T cell simulator (available in the biological modeling package BioNetGen). We run experiments with two alternate goals: developing regulatory T cells or developing effector T cells. The former is important for preventing autoimmune diseases while the latter is associated with better survival rates in cancer patients. We are especially interested in the effect of sequential plans, an approach that has not been explored extensively in the biological literature. We show that for the development of regulatory cells, sequential plans yield significantly higher utility than the best static therapy. In contrast, for developing effector cells, we find that (at least for the given simulator, objective function, action possibilities, and measurement possibilities) single-step plans suffice for

is dealing with large, or even infinite, action spaces. In games of imperfect information, the leading approach is to find a Nash equilibrium in a smaller abstract version of the game that includes only a few actions at each decision point, and then map the solution back to the original game. However, it is difficult to know which actions should be included in the abstraction without first solving the game, and it is infeasible to solve the game without first abstracting it.We introduce a method that combines abstraction with equilibrium finding by enabling actions to be added to the abstraction at run time. This allows an agent to begin learning with a coarse abstraction, and then to strategically insert actions at points that the strategy computed in the current abstraction deems important. The algorithm can quickly add actions to the abstraction while provably not having to restart the equilibrium finding. It enables anytime convergence to a Nash equilibrium of the full game even in infinite games. Experiments show it can outperform fixed abstractions at every stage of the run: early on it improves as quickly as equilibrium finding in coarse abstractions, and later it converges to a better solution than does equilibrium finding in fine-grained abstractions.",1332,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_1439783155,msa_1439783155,-20.618,msa,msa_1439783155,04077,"[{u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'aaai', u'CId': 1184914352}",5,"{u'CIId': 86878734, u'CIN': u'aaai 2015'}",2015-01-25,"{""DN"":""Steering evolution strategically: computational game theory and opponent exploitation for treatment planning, drug design, and synthetic biology"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":121,""InvertedIndex"":{""Living"":[0],""organisms"":[1,22],""adapt"":[2],""to"":[3,12,89],""challenges"":[4],""through"":[5],""evolution"":[6],""and"":[7,42,108,118],""adaptation."":[8],""This"":[9,77],""has"":[10,69],""proven"":[11],""be"":[13,79,96],""a"":[14,67,70],""key"":[15],""difficulty"":[16],""in"":[17],""developing"":[18],""therapies,"":[19],""since"":[20],""the"":[21,27,56,61,64,87,105],""develop"":[23],""resistance."":[24],""I"":[25],""propose"":[26],""wild"":[28],""idea"":[29],""of"":[30],""steering"":[31,51],""evolution/adaptation"":[32],""strategically—using"":[33],""computational"":[34],""game"":[35],""theory"":[36],""for"":[37,50,55],""(typically"":[38],""incomplete-information)"":[39],""multistage"":[40],""games"":[41],""opponent"":[43,65,88],""exploitation"":[44],""techniques."":[45],""A"":[46],""sequential"":[47],""contingency"":[48],""plan"":[49],""is"":[52],""constructed"":[53],""computationally"":[54],""setting"":[57],""at"":[58,104],""hand."":[59],""In"":[60],""biological"":[62],""context,"":[63],""(e.g.,"":[66],""disease)"":[68],""systematic"":[71],""handicap"":[72],""because"":[73],""it"":[74,94],""evolves"":[75],""myopically."":[76],""can"":[78,95],""exploited"":[80],""by"":[81],""computing"":[82],""trapping"":[83],""strategies"":[84],""that"":[85],""cause"":[86],""evolve"":[90],""into"":[91],""states"":[92],""where"":[93],""handled"":[97],""effectively."":[98],""Potential"":[99],""application"":[100],""classes"":[101],""include"":[102],""therapeutics"":[103],""population,"":[106],""individual,"":[107],""molecular"":[109],""levels"":[110],""(drug"":[111],""design),"":[112],""as"":[113,115],""well"":[114],""cell"":[116],""repurposing"":[117],""synthetic"":[119],""biology."":[120]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/aaai2015.html#Sandholm15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2888283""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/view/10047""}],""VFN"":""National Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""AAAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":1}],""BV"":""AAAI'15 Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",5,"[{u'FN': u'adaptation', u'FId': 156983192}, {u'FN': u'evolution', u'FId': 167329199}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}]",2203513283,,en,0,"[2122410182, 2750606726, 1945527616, 2062663664, 1960351623, 1788492920, 2739393805, 2153816030, 2512124523, 1974647057, 2168356773, 2151161180, 2188529601, 1485287448, 194461482, 1991083334, 2026829590, 2166400734, 2024561607, 2158973351, 2010375850, 2104402102, 1932734735, 123163709, 2106856651, 2514317902]",steering evolution strategically computational game theory and opponent exploitation for treatment planning drug design and synthetic biology,0,"[u'biology', u'computational', u'design', u'drug', u'evolution', u'exploitation', u'game', u'opponent', u'planning', u'steering', u'strategically', u'synthetic', u'theory', u'treatment']",2015,"Living organisms adapt to challenges through evolution and adaptation.

A sequential contingency plan for steering is constructed computationally for the setting at hand. In the biological context, the opponent (e.g., a disease) has a systematic handicap because it evolves myopically. This can be exploited by computing trapping strategies that cause the opponent to evolve into states where it can be handled effectively.

We introduce the first general, principled method for warm starting CFR. Our approach requires only a strategy for each player, and accomplishes the warm start at the cost of a single traversal of the game tree. The method provably warm starts CFR to as many iterations as it would have taken to reach a strategy profile of the same quality as the input strategies, and does not alter the convergence bounds of the algorithms. Unlike prior approaches to warm starting, ours can be applied in all cases.Our method is agnostic to the origins of the input strategies.

The mechanism does not require assumptions about the underlying distribution of compatibility graphs—a nuance that has previously produced conflicting results in other aspects of theoretical kidney exchange. Our results apply not only to matching via 2-cycles: the matchings can also include cycles of any length and altruist-initiated chains, which is important at least in kidney exchanges. The mechanism can also be adjusted to guarantee immediate individual rationality at the expense of economic efficiency, while preserving strategy proofness via the credits.

Any strong Nash equilibrium outcome is Pareto efficient for each coalition. First, we analyze the two--player setting. Our main result, in its simplest form, states that if a game has a strong Nash equilibrium with full support (that is, both players randomize among all pure strategies), then the game is strictly competitive. In order to get our result we use the indifference principle fulfilled by any Nash equilibrium, and the classical KKT conditions (in the vector setting), that are necessary conditions for Pareto efficiency. Our characterization enables us to design a strong-Nash-equilibrium-finding algorithm with complexity in Smoothed-$\mathcal{P}$. So, this problem---that Conitzer and Sandholm [Conitzer, V., Sandholm, T., 2008. New complexity results about Nash equilibria. Games Econ. Behav. 63, 621--641] proved to be computationally hard in the worst case---is generically easy. Hence, although the worst case complexity of finding a strong Nash equilibrium is harder than that of finding a Nash equilibrium, once small perturbations are applied, finding a strong Nash is easier than finding a Nash equilibrium. Next we switch to the setting with more than two players. We demonstrate that a strong Nash equilibrium can exist in which an outcome that is strictly Pareto dominated by a Nash equilibrium occurs with positive probability. Finally, we prove that games that have a strong Nash equilibrium where at least one player puts positive probability on at least two pure strategies are extremely rare: they are of zero measure.",1639,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_1667857601,msa_1667857601,-21.595,msa,msa_1667857601,04199,"[{u'AuId': 2131951165, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'noam brown', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Noam Brown'}, {u'AuId': 2153142498, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'sam ganzfried', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Sam Ganzfried'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'aaai', u'CId': 1184914352}",0,"{u'CIId': 86878734, u'CIN': u'aaai 2015'}",2015-01-25,"{""DN"":""Tartanian7: a champion two-player no-limit texas hold'em poker-playing program"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":175,""InvertedIndex"":{""The"":[0,46],""leading"":[1],""approach"":[2,114,126],""for"":[3,69,156],""solving"":[4],""large"":[5,129],""imperfect-information"":[6],""games"":[7],""is"":[8],""automated"":[9],""abstraction"":[10,53,77],""followed"":[11],""by"":[12],""running"":[13,60],""an"":[14,67,91,154],""equilibrium-finding"":[15,27],""algorithm."":[16],""We"":[17,65,148],""introduce"":[18,66,138],""a"":[19,98,101,118,128,139],""distributed"":[20],""version"":[21],""of"":[22,44,94,141],""the"":[23,52,58,84,123,163],""most"":[24],""commonly"":[25],""used"":[26],""algorithm,"":[28],""counterfactual"":[29],""regret"":[30],""minimization"":[31],""(CFR),"":[32],""which"":[33],""enables"":[34],""CFR"":[35],""to"":[36,38,56,117,152],""scale"":[37],""dramatically"":[39],""larger"":[40],""abstractions"":[41,72],""and"":[42,83],""numbers"":[43],""cores."":[45],""new"":[47],""algorithm"":[48,68],""begets"":[49],""constraints"":[50],""on"":[51,61,75,97,110,127],""so"":[54],""as"":[55,80],""make"":[57],""pieces"":[59],""different"":[62],""computers"":[63],""disjoint."":[64],""generating"":[70],""such"":[71,79],""while"":[73],""capitalizing"":[74],""state-of-the-art"":[76],""ideas"":[78],""imperfect"":[81],""recall"":[82],""earth-mover's-distance"":[85],""similarity"":[86],""metric."":[87],""Our"":[88,113],""techniques"":[89,143,151],""enabled"":[90],""equilibrium"":[92],""computation"":[93],""unprecedented"":[95],""size"":[96],""supercomputer"":[99],""with"":[100,132,172],""high"":[102],""inter-blade"":[103],""memory"":[104,134],""latency."":[105,135],""Prior"":[106],""approaches"":[107],""run"":[108],""slowly"":[109],""this"":[111],""architecture."":[112],""also"":[115],""leads"":[116],""significant"":[119],""improvement"":[120],""over"":[121],""using"":[122],""prior"":[124,146],""best"":[125],""shared-memory"":[130],""server"":[131],""low"":[133],""Finally,"":[136],""we"":[137],""family"":[140],""post-processing"":[142],""that"":[144],""outperform"":[145],""ones."":[147],""applied"":[149],""these"":[150],""generate"":[153],""agent"":[155],""two-player"":[157],""no-limit"":[158],""Texas"":[159],""Hold'em."":[160],""It"":[161],""won"":[162],""2014"":[164],""Annual"":[165],""Computer"":[166],""Poker"":[167],""Competition,"":[168],""beating"":[169],""each"":[170],""opponent"":[171],""statistical"":[173],""significance."":[174]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/Tartanian7_AAAI15_demo_cr_1.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/aaai2015.html#BrownGS15""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2888361""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/view/9962""}],""VFN"":""National Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""AAAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Noam"",""LN"":""Brown"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Sam"",""LN"":""Ganzfried"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":3}],""BV"":""AAAI'15 Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'perfect information', u'FId': 123676819}, {u'FN': u'game theory', u'FId': 177142836}, {u'FN': u'theoretical computer science', u'FId': 80444323}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'machine learning', u'FId': 119857082}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'statistics', u'FId': 105795698}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2198363679,,en,0,"[2106975967, 2121513215, 1847992018, 2294747104]",tartanian7 a champion two player no limit texas hold em poker playing program,0,"[u'champion', u'em', u'hold', u'limit', u'player', u'playing', u'poker', u'program', u'tartanian7', u'texas', u'two']",2015,"The leading approach for solving large imperfect-information games is automated abstraction followed by running an equilibrium-finding algorithm. We introduce a distributed version of the most commonly used equilibrium-finding algorithm, counterfactual regret minimization (CFR), which enables CFR to scale to dramatically larger abstractions and numbers of cores. The new algorithm begets constraints on the abstraction so as to make the pieces running on different computers disjoint. We introduce an algorithm for generating such abstractions while capitalizing on state-of-the-art abstraction ideas such as imperfect recall and the earth-mover's-distance similarity metric. Our techniques enabled an equilibrium computation of unprecedented size on a supercomputer with a high inter-blade memory latency. Prior approaches run slowly on this architecture. Our approach also leads to a significant improvement over using the prior best approach on a large shared-memory server with low memory latency. Finally, we introduce a family of post-processing techniques that outperform prior ones. We applied these techniques to generate an agent for two-player no-limit Texas Hold'em.

The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on. We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that only a logarithmic dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of Ω( b   dd  ), where  b  is the branching factor of the player, and  d  is the depth of the game tree.   Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their theoretically inferior convergence rates. Using our new weighting scheme and practical tuning we show that, for the first time, the excessive gap technique can be made faster than the fastest counterfactual regret minimization algorithm, CFRP, in practice.",1377,tuomas sandholm,computer science department,,,,msa_2589557409,msa_2589557409,-21.193,msa,msa_2589557409,04437,"[{u'AuId': 2125216766, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'john p dickerson', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'John Paul Dickerson'}, {u'AuId': 2070867630, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'tuomas sandholm', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Tuomas Sandholm'}]","{u'CN': u'aaai', u'CId': 1184914352}",0,"{u'CIId': 205598550, u'CIN': u'aaai 2013'}",2013-01-01,"{""DN"":""Throwing darts: random sampling helps tree search when the number of short certificates is moderate"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":100,""InvertedIndex"":{""One"":[0],""typically"":[1],""proves"":[2],""infeasibility"":[3,78],""in"":[4,10,23],""satisfiability/"":[5],""constraint"":[6],""satisfaction"":[7],""(or"":[8],""optimality"":[9],""integer"":[11],""programming)"":[12],""by"":[13,56,93,97],""constructing"":[14],""a"":[15,39],""tree"":[16,26],""certificate."":[17],""However,"":[18],""deciding"":[19],""how"":[20],""to"":[21,59,62,68],""branch"":[22],""the"":[24,36,48,72,83,94],""search"":[25,31],""is"":[27,79,88],""hard,"":[28],""and"":[29,51],""impacts"":[30],""time"":[32],""drastically."":[33],""We"":[34],""explore"":[35],""power"":[37],""of"":[38,43,74,77,85],""simple"":[40],""paradigm,"":[41],""that"":[42,57,82],""throwing"":[44,86],""random"":[45],""darts"":[46,87],""into"":[47],""assignment"":[49],""space"":[50],""then"":[52],""using"":[53],""information"":[54,95],""gathered"":[55],""dart"":[58],""guide"":[60],""what"":[61],""do"":[63],""next."":[64],""This"":[65],""method"":[66],""seems"":[67],""work"":[69],""well"":[70],""when"":[71],""number"":[73],""short"":[75],""certificates"":[76],""moderate,"":[80],""suggesting"":[81],""overhead"":[84],""more"":[89],""than"":[90],""paid"":[91],""for"":[92],""gained"":[96],""these"":[98],""darts."":[99]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":3,""U"":""http://jpdickerson.com/pubs/dickerson13throwing.pdf""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aaai/late2013.html#DickersonS13""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2908292""}],""VFN"":""National Conference on Artificial Intelligence"",""VSN"":""AAAI"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""John Paul"",""LN"":""Dickerson"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Tuomas"",""LN"":""Sandholm"",""S"":2}],""BV"":""AAAIWS'13-17 Proceedings of the 17th AAAI Conference on Late-Breaking Developments in the Field of Artificial Intelligence"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'sampling', u'FId': 90842384}, {u'FN': u'artificial intelligence', u'FId': 154945302}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'algorithm', u'FId': 11413529}]",2269056231,,en,0,"[1518705996, 2147148915, 2119190805, 2514040739, 1709155369, 2060514920, 203746830, 2148818117, 2156987683, 30044362, 2030455524, 2136950039, 2611428983, 1509089938, 2113932434, 2119634222, 203718333, 2027605646, 2089358540, 2007316622, 2057832617, 2158359808, 2738217451, 2113030161, 1973734335, 2153441483]",throwing darts random sampling helps tree search when the number of short certificates is moderate,0,"[u'certificates', u'darts', u'helps', u'moderate', u'number', u'random', u'sampling', u'search', u'short', u'throwing', u'tree']",2013,"One typically proves infeasibility in satisfiability/ constraint satisfaction (or optimality in integer programming) by constructing a tree certificate.

In this paper, we show how uncertain extractions about entities and their relations can be transformed into a knowledge graph. The extractions form an extraction graph and we refer to the task of removing noise, inferring missing information, and determining which candidate facts should be included into a knowledge graph as knowledge graph identification. In order to perform this task, we must reason jointly about candidate facts and their associated extraction confidences, identify co-referent entities, and incorporate ontological constraints. Our proposed approach uses probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework which easily scales to millions of facts. We demonstrate the power of our method on a synthetic Linked Data corpus derived from the MusicBrainz music community and a real-world set of extractions from the NELL project containing over 1M extractions and 70K ontological relations. We show that compared to existing methods, our approach is able to achieve improved AUC and F1 with significantly lower running time.",1286,william cohen,machine learning department,59dcbf132bdc9e7b0a70cf9d,wos_cs_811,,,msa_1942169943,-19.225,wos_pm,wos_cs_811,01460,"[{u'AuId': 2253869372, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'nathaniel horner', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Nathaniel Horner'}, {u'AuId': 2434074371, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'ines l azevedo', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Ines Azevedo'}, {u'AuId': 2567521223, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'doug sicker', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Doug Sicker'}, {u'AuId': 2112448066, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'yuvraj agarwal', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Yuvraj Agarwal'}]","{u'CN': u'smartgridcomm', u'CId': 2622668024}",0,,2016-11-01,"{""DN"":""Dynamic data center load response to variability in private and public electricity costs"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":151,""InvertedIndex"":{""This"":[0],""paper"":[1],""assesses"":[2],""the"":[3,43,63,129,132,140],""potential"":[4],""cost-saving"":[5],""incentives"":[6,29],""for"":[7],""content"":[8],""distribution"":[9],""networks"":[10],""to"":[11,22,35,62,93,128],""shift"":[12],""traffic"":[13],""load"":[14,102],""among"":[15],""geographically"":[16],""distributed"":[17],""data"":[18],""centers"":[19],""in"":[20,25,106,113],""response"":[21],""hourly"":[23],""variation"":[24],""electricity"":[26,148],""prices."":[27],""Such"":[28],""are"":[30,54],""likely"":[31],""aligned"":[32,57],""with"":[33,58,80,126],""benefits"":[34,60,99],""utilities"":[36],""and"":[37,67,97,100,110,120,147],""grid"":[38],""operators,"":[39],""which"":[40],""might"":[41],""take"":[42],""form"":[44],""of"":[45,65,134,142],""peak-shaving"":[46],""or"":[47],""ancillary"":[48],""services."":[49],""However,"":[50,131],""private"":[51,77,98],""cost"":[52,78,108],""savings"":[53,109,136],""not"":[55],""strictly"":[56],""public"":[59,96],""related"":[61],""avoidance"":[64],""health"":[66],""environmental"":[68],""damages"":[69,112],""from"":[70],""power"":[71],""plant"":[72],""emissions,"":[73],""so"":[74],""we"":[75],""compare"":[76],""minimization"":[79],""a"":[81,143],""strategy"":[82],""that"":[83,89,101],""minimizes"":[84],""these"":[85],""externalities."":[86],""We"":[87],""find"":[88],""feasible"":[90],""strategies"":[91],""exist"":[92],""simultaneously"":[94],""realize"":[95],""shifting"":[103],""can"":[104,123],""result"":[105],""substantial"":[107],""avoided"":[111],""some"":[114],""circumstances."":[115],""Concerns"":[116],""over"":[117],""increased"":[118],""latency"":[119],""bandwidth"":[121],""costs"":[122],""be"":[124],""mitigated"":[125],""modifications"":[127],""model."":[130],""level"":[133],""realized"":[135],""is"":[137],""dependent"":[138],""upon"":[139],""specifics"":[141],""particular"":[144],""network"":[145],""operator"":[146],""rate"":[149],""schedule."":[150]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/smartgridcomm/smartgridcomm2016.html#HornerASA16""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7778742/""}],""VFN"":""International Conference on Smart Grid Communications"",""VSN"":""SmartGridComm"",""DOI"":""10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778742"",""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Nathaniel"",""LN"":""Horner"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Ines"",""LN"":""Azevedo"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Doug"",""LN"":""Sicker"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Yuvraj"",""LN"":""Agarwal"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)"",""BT"":""p""}",0,"[{u'FN': u'smart grid', u'FId': 10558101}, {u'FN': u'server', u'FId': 93996380}, {u'FN': u'electricity generation', u'FId': 423512}, {u'FN': u'electric potential', u'FId': 58570533}, {u'FN': u'electrical engineering', u'FId': 119599485}, {u'FN': u'operating system', u'FId': 111919701}, {u'FN': u'computer security', u'FId': 38652104}, {u'FN': u'simulation', u'FId': 44154836}, {u'FN': u'computer science', u'FId': 41008148}]",2562427903,,,3,"[2168245849, 2051653018, 1541754180, 2011205796, 2052671641, 240410933, 1505393241, 2166454355, 2018107375, 2736578080, 2337507902, 2418987598, 294690399, 2187459923]",dynamic data center load response to variability in private and public electricity costs,0,"[u'center', u'costs', u'data', u'dynamic', u'electricity', u'load', u'private', u'public', u'response', u'variability']",2016,"This paper assesses the potential cost-saving incentives for content distribution networks to shift traffic load among geographically distributed data centers in response to hourly variation in electricity prices. Such incentives are likely aligned with benefits to utilities and grid operators, which might take the form of peak-shaving or ancillary services. However, private cost savings are not strictly aligned with public benefits related to the avoidance of health and environmental damages from power plant emissions, so we compare private cost minimization with a strategy that minimizes these externalities. We find that feasible strategies exist to simultaneously realize public and private benefits and that load shifting can result in substantial cost savings and avoided damages in some circumstances. Concerns over increased latency and bandwidth costs can be mitigated with modifications to the model.

We then develop a large library of efficient epigraph projection operators, mirroring and extending work on fast proximal algorithms, for many common convex functions.

Furthermore, we present two applications that use this algorithm as a fast subroutine for a more complex outer loop: segmenting linear regression models for time series data, and color image denoising.

In this paper, we analyze the ""gradient descent"" form of GAN optimization (i.e., the natural setting where we simultaneously take small gradient steps in both generator and discriminator parameters). We show that even though GAN optimization does not correspond to a convex-concave game, even for simple parameterizations, under proper conditions, equilibrium points of this optimization procedure are still locally asymptotically stable for the traditional GAN formulation. On the other hand, we show that the recently-proposed Wasserstein GAN can have non-convergent limit cycles near equilibrium. Motivated by this stability analysis, we propose an additional regularization term for gradient descent GAN updates, which is able to guarantee local stability for both the WGAN and for the traditional GAN, and also shows practical promise in speeding up convergence and addressing mode collapse.",1021,zico kolter,computer science department,,,,msa_2624823827,msa_2624823827,-21.483,msa,msa_2624823827,02132,"[{u'AuId': 2124484232, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'milad memarzadeh', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Milad Memarzadeh'}, {u'AuId': 2045515153, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'matteo pozzi', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Matteo Pozzi'}, {u'AuId': 2219978048, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'j zico kolter', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'J.

This is typically the case of wind farms, which are made up by similar turbines. Optimal management of wind farms is an important task due to high cost of turbines׳ operation and maintenance: in this context, we recently proposed a method for planning and learning at system-level, called PLUS, built upon the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, which treats transition and emission probabilities as random variables, and is therefore suitable for including model uncertainty. PLUS models the components as independent or identical. In this paper, we extend that formulation, allowing for a weaker similarity among components. The proposed approach, called Multiple Uncertain POMDP (MU-POMDP), models the components as POMDPs, and assumes the corresponding parameters as dependent random variables. Through this framework, we can calibrate specific degradation and emission models for each component while, at the same time, process observations at system-level. We compare the performance of the proposed MU-POMDP with PLUS, and discuss its potential and computational complexity.",1343,zico kolter,computer science department,,,,msa_2390735409,msa_2390735409,-21.241,msa,msa_2390735409,02297,"[{u'AuId': 2301646678, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xiao zhang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Xiao Zhang'}, {u'AuId': 2097022318, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'gabriela hug', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Gabriela Hug'}, {u'AuId': 2230767602, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'zico kolter', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Zico Kolter'}, {u'AuId': 2281329724, u'AfN': u'ladenburg thalmann', u'DAfN': u'Ladenburg Thalmann', u'S': 4, u'AuN': u'iiro harjunkoski', u'AfId': 897630457, u'DAuN': u'Iiro Harjunkoski'}]","{u'CN': u'naps', u'CId': 2624310872}",9,,2015-10-01,"{""DN"":""Industrial demand response by steel plants with spinning reserve provision"",""IA"":{""IndexLength"":123,""InvertedIndex"":{""Demand"":[0],""response"":[1],""has"":[2],""gained"":[3],""significant"":[4],""attention"":[5],""in"":[6,20,59],""recent"":[7],""years"":[8],""as"":[9,27,78],""it"":[10],""demonstrates"":[11],""potentials"":[12],""to"":[13,89,110],""enhance"":[14],""the"":[15,70,79,84,87,103,116,119],""power"":[16,64,91],""system's"":[17],""operational"":[18],""flexibility"":[19],""a"":[21,43],""cost-effective"":[22],""way."":[23],""Industrial"":[24],""loads"":[25,55,76],""such"":[26,77],""steel"":[28,80,104],""manufacturing"":[29],""plants"":[30,81],""consume"":[31],""large"":[32],""amounts"":[33],""of"":[34,46,53,61],""electric"":[35],""energy,"":[36],""and"":[37,86,106,118],""their"":[38,47,63],""electricity"":[39],""bills"":[40],""account"":[41],""for"":[42],""remarkable"":[44],""percentage"":[45],""total"":[48],""operation"":[49,93],""cost."":[50],""Meanwhile,"":[51],""lots"":[52],""industrial"":[54,75],""are"":[56],""very"":[57],""flexible"":[58],""terms"":[60],""adjusting"":[62],""consumption"":[65],""rate,"":[66],""e.g."":[67],""through"":[68,94],""switching"":[69],""transformer"":[71],""tap"":[72],""position."":[73],""Hence,"":[74],""have"":[82],""both"":[83,115],""motivation"":[85],""ability"":[88],""support"":[90],""system"":[92],""demand"":[95],""response."":[96],""In"":[97],""this"":[98],""paper,"":[99],""we"":[100],""focus"":[101],""on"":[102],""plant"":[105],""optimize"":[107],""its"":[108,112],""scheduling"":[109],""maximize"":[111],""profits"":[113],""from"":[114],""energy"":[117],""spinning"":[120],""reserve"":[121],""markets."":[122]}},""S"":[{""Ty"":1,""U"":""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7335115""},{""Ty"":1,""U"":""https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/publication(8d65e7e9-f26d-424d-bc6e-c3dfff593ccc).html""}],""VFN"":""North American Power Symposium"",""VSN"":""NAPS"",""DOI"":""10.1109/NAPS.2015.7335115"",""RP"":[{""Id"":2010571098,""CoC"":6},{""Id"":1553013994,""CoC"":5}],""ANF"":[{""FN"":""Xiao"",""LN"":""Zhang"",""S"":1},{""FN"":""Gabriela"",""LN"":""Hug"",""S"":2},{""FN"":""Zico"",""LN"":""Kolter"",""S"":3},{""FN"":""Iiro"",""LN"":""Harjunkoski"",""S"":4}],""BV"":""2015 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)"",""BT"":""p""}",9,"[{u'FN': u'steel mill', u'FId': 115244140}, {u'FN': u'dynamic demand', u'FId': 45872418}, {u'FN': u'forensic engineering', u'FId': 77595967}, {u'FN': u'engineering', u'FId': 127413603}]",2127618983,,en,3,"[2097392150, 2123017553, 2036001459, 2082034273, 2010571098, 2095508122, 2027813323, 2119773359, 2078889957, 2021191095, 1982543215, 2029750216, 2012562405, 1553013994, 2039652300]",industrial demand response by steel plants with spinning reserve provision,0,"[u'demand', u'industrial', u'plants', u'provision', u'reserve', u'response', u'spinning', u'steel']",2015,"Demand response has gained significant attention in recent years as it demonstrates potentials to enhance the power system's operational flexibility in a cost-effective way.

Although it is known that probabilistic forecasts (which give a distribution over possible future outcomes) can improve planning and control, many forecasting systems in practice are just used as “point forecast” tools, as it is challenging to represent high-dimensional non-Gaussian distributions over multiple spatial and temporal points. In this paper, we apply a recently-proposed algorithm for modeling high-dimensional conditional Gaussian distributions to forecasting wind power and extend it to the non-Gaussian case using the copula transform. On a wind power forecasting task, we show that this probabilistic model greatly outperforms other methods on the task of accurately modeling potential distributions of power (as would be necessary in a stochastic dispatch problem, for example).",957,zico kolter,computer science department,,,,msa_1980746328,msa_1980746328,-20.457,msa,msa_1980746328,02856,"[{u'AuId': 2301646678, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 1, u'AuN': u'xiao zhang', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'Xiao Zhang'}, {u'AuId': 2097022318, u'AfN': u'eth zurich', u'DAfN': u'ETH Zurich', u'S': 2, u'AuN': u'gabriela hug', u'AfId': 35440088, u'DAuN': u'Gabriela Hug'}, {u'AuId': 2219978048, u'AfN': u'carnegie mellon university', u'DAfN': u'Carnegie Mellon University', u'S': 3, u'AuN': u'j zico kolter', u'AfId': 74973139, u'DAuN': u'J.

We show that for certain problems, the method is strictly decreasing and guaranteed to converge to a critical point. We then apply the algorithm to three separate domains: solving the maximum cut semidefinite relaxation, solving a (novel) maximum satisfiability relaxation, and solving the GloVe word embedding optimization problem. In all settings, we demonstrate improvement over the existing state of the art along various dimensions.

The latter is defined by the basic subproblem of modeling the conditional mean of one variable as a sparse function of all others. Our approach models a set of conditional quantiles of one variable as a sparse function of all others, and hence offers a much richer, more expressive class of conditional distribution estimates. We establish that, under suitable regularity conditions, the MQGM identifies the exact conditional independencies with probability tending to one as the problem size grows, even outside of the usual homoskedastic Gaussian data model. We develop an efficient algorithm for fitting the MQGM using the alternating direction method of multipliers. We also describe a strategy for sampling from the joint distribution that underlies the MQGM estimate. Lastly, we present detailed experiments that demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the MQGM in modeling hetereoskedastic non-Gaussian data.",1099,zico kolter,computer science department,,,,msa_2460864273,msa_2460864273,-21.477,msa,msa_2460864273,0
