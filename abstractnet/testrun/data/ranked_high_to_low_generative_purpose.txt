We consider the problem of k-colouring a random r-uniform hypergraph with n vertices and cn edges, where k, r, c remain constant as n→∞ n→∞. Achlioptas and Naor showed that the chromatic number of a random graph in this setting, the case r= 2 r= 2, must have one of two easily computable values as n→∞ n→∞. We give a complete generalisation of this result to random uniform hypergraphs.

在基于Mean-Shift 的目标跟踪算法中, 尺度自适应机制是算法研究的一个重要方向. 一种典型的方法采用Lindeberg 的尺度空间理论以获取目标尺度信息. 但现有算法中将尺度由2-D 矢量压缩为1-D 量, 未能精细地刻画目标仿射变换时的尺度变化, 从而限制了算法的适用范围. 为此, 该文将尺度维1-D 滤波推广至2-D, 构造得到了相应的4-D 尺度空间, 并利用空间维和尺度维的Mean-Shift 交替迭代, 实现了同时在空间位置和尺度方向对目标的有效跟踪, 提高了算法在目标尺度变化时的自适应性, 并扩大了算法的适用范围.
