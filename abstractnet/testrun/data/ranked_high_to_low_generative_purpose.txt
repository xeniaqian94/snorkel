We consider the problem of k-colouring a random r-uniform hypergraph with n vertices and cn edges, where k, r, c remain constant as n‚Üí‚àû n‚Üí‚àû. Achlioptas and Naor showed that the chromatic number of a random graph in this setting, the case r= 2 r= 2, must have one of two easily computable values as n‚Üí‚àû n‚Üí‚àû. We give a complete generalisation of this result to random uniform hypergraphs.

We show that the quality of ParaEval's evaluations, measured by correlating with human judgments, closely resembles that of ROUGE's.
	0.0035740713682627144
We present its empirical evaluation, which shows that its precision and recall are about 98%.

We show that this labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers are used on the distantly-labeled data.

Using these statistics in various scoring terms we are able to significantly outperform baseline pruning methods and we can show that the number of phrase pairs can be reduced by up to 80% without significantly affecting the overall system performance.

Simulation results show that, compared with using one variant linear regression direct analysis, our method can get more accurate unknown coefficients.

For this purpose, we propose a model-based approach representing kinematic joint structure and using cut-plane joint extraction on 3D reconstructed volume models of the individual person.

Our method shows good classification accuracy using real data.

Using the model as a lens, we present an analysis of four important coordination roles identified using the model, including Workers, Critiquers, Encouragers, and Managers.

In this paper, we show that when we have multiple dimensions in the dataset, then tensor analysis is a powerful and promising tool.

In two experiments we show that these feelings of attachment to subgroups increase loyalty to the larger community.
	0.002635230102885028
We illustrate our approach through concrete examples and present the result of our preliminary experiments which support support the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

We show that duration modifications are better using Mel-Cepstral vocoder for higher modification factor while pitch modifications are better using instants of Significant Excitations.	0.002469087111513928
We apply the GMM-based mapping using the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, which has been proposed for voice conversion, to the two mappings.

Finally, we demonstrate that a BioRob and a Barrett WAM can play catch together using the previously acquired skills.
