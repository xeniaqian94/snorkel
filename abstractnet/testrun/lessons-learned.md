## Automated abstract segmentation

### Task definition 

This task examines effective weak-supervision approach to segment abstracts (into sections of *background*, *problem*, *mechanism*, *finding*, etc.). It serve as the pre-processing technique to support analogical thinking for scientific researchers to generate new ideas.

We illustrate the segmentation (red as problem section, blue as mechanism section) below, compared with ground-truth segmentation from human annotators, and supervised segmentation from a labeled dataset in [SOLVENT paper](http://joelchan.me/assets/pdf/2018-cscw-schema-highlighter.pdf).
