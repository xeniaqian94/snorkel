When systems are composed of multiple machines, configurations, and software components that interact with each other, risk perception must account for the composition of security requirements. In this paper, we report on how changes to security requirements affect analysts risk perceptions and their decisions about how to modify the requirements to reach adequate security levels. <font color='purple'>We conducted two user surveys of 174 participants wherein participants assess security levels across 64 factorial vignettes.</font> <font color='purple'><font color='blue'>We analyzed the survey results using multi-level modeling to test for the effect of security requirements composition on participants' overall security adequacy ratings and on their ratings of individual requirements.</font></font> We accompanied this analysis with grounded analysis of elicited requirements aimed at lowering the security risk. <font color='blue'>Our results suggest that requirements composition affects experts' adequacy ratings on security requirements.</font> In addition, we identified three categories of requirements modifications, called refinements, replacements and reinforcements, and we measured how these categories compare with overall perceived security risk. Finally, we discuss the future impact of our work in security requirements assessment practice."
