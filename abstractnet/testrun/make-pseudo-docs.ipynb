      "******************************\n",
      "Background Online communities have the potential to be supportive, cruel, or anywhere in between . The development of positive norms for interaction can help users build bonds, grow, and learn .\n",
      "Method Using millions of messages sent in Twitch chatrooms,\n",
      "Purpose we explore the effectiveness of methods for encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors, including taking advantage of imitation effects through setting positive examples and using moderation tools to discourage antisocial behaviors .\n",
      "Background Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory,\n",
      "Findings users imitated examples of behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users . Proactive moderation tools, such as chat modes which restricted the ability to post certain content, proved effective at discouraging spam behaviors, while reactive bans were able to discourage a wider variety of behaviors .\n",
      "Paper: 2017_10\n",
      "******************************\n",
      "Background Recent research has demonstrated that ( a ) groups can be characterized by a collective intelligence ( CI ) factor that measures their ability to perform together on a wide range of different tasks, and ( b ) this factor can predict groups ' performance on other tasks in the future .\n",
      "Purpose The current study examines whether these results translate into the world of teams in competitive online video games where self-organized, time-pressured, and intense collaboration occurs purely online .\n",
      "Method In this study of teams playing the online game League of Legends,\n",
      "Paper: 2017_11\n",
      "******************************\n",
      "Purpose Forming work teams involves matching people with complementary skills and personalities, but requires obtaining such data a priori .\n",
      "Mechanism We introduce team dating, where people interact on brief tasks before working with a dedicated partner for longer, more complex tasks .\n",
      "Method We studied team dating through two online experiments . In Experiment 1, workers from a crowd platform independently wrote an ad slogan, discussed it with three consecutive people and evaluated their team date interactions . They then selected preferred teammates from a list showing average ratings for people they had dated and not dated .\n",
      "Findings Results show that participants evaluated their dates based on evidence beyond externally judged slogan quality, and relied heavily on their dyad-specific judgments in selecting teammates .\n",
      "Method In Experiment 2, we replicated the individual and team dating tasks, and formed teams, either i ) by honoring pairwise team dating preferences, ii ) randomly from their pool of dates, or iii ) randomly from those not dated .\n",
      "Findings Results show that teams formed from preferred dates performed better on a final creative task compared to random dates or non-dates .\n",
      "Mechanism Team dating provides a dynamic technique\n",
      "Purpose for forming ad hoc teams accounting for interpersonal dynamics .\n",
      "Paper: 2017_4\n",
      "******************************\n",
      "Background Collective intelligence ( CI ) , a group 's capacity to perform a wide variety of tasks, is a key factor in successful collaboration .\n",
      "Purpose Group composition, particularly diversity and member social perceptiveness, are consistent predictors of CI, but we have limited knowledge about the mechanisms underlying their effects . To address this gap, we examine how physiological synchrony, as an indicator of coordination and rapport, relates to CI in computer-mediated teams, and if synchrony might serve as a mechanism explaining the effect of group composition on CI .\n",
      "Method We present results from a laboratory experiment where 60 dyads completed the Test of Collective Intelligence ( TCI ) together online and rated their group satisfaction, while wearing physiological sensors .\n",
      "Findings We find that synchrony in facial expressions ( indicative of shared experience ) was associated with CI and synchrony in skin conductance ( indicative of shared arousal ) with group satisfaction . Furthermore, various forms of synchrony mediated the effect of member diversity and social perceptiveness on CI and group satisfaction .\n",
      "Paper: 2017_5\n",
      "******************************\n",
      "Background Feedback is information that can improve task performance . Online communities, educational forums, and crowd-based feedback platforms all support feedback exchange among a more diverse set of sources than ever before, with greater control over how to moderate this exchange .\n",
      "Purpose In this work, we study how the power relationship between the source and receiver and the tone of language influence the recep-tivity, effort, and work performance resulting from online feedback exchange .\n",
      "Method We conducted an online experiment manipulating affective language and source of feedback on a writing task .\n",
      "Findings We found that critiques with positive affec-tive language increased positive emotions and reduced participants ' annoyance and frustration, which led to an increase in work quality, compared to critiques without positive language . Feedback without positive affective language led to more edits, but not better work outcomes . Participants reacted more positively to feedback from an anonymous source than from a peer or an authority .\n",
